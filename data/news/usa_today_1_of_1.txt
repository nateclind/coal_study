Building a massive environmental organization to fight global warming -- much as the National Rifle Association lobbies against gun control -- is an intriguing idea. But no 
matter the size and funding, it would face obstacles: 
Big autos, big oil and big utilities, which pollute as part of business, lobby against environmental protections. Automakers devote vast sums of their $14 billion marketing budget 
advertising gas-guzzling SUVs. The oil industry profits by fueling those trucks. And the coal industry enjoys a president who peddles fake news about coal's rebirth. 

Much of the news media devote only episodic attention to the threats global warming poses, reporting on its most scary impacts, including hurricanes and wildfires, without 

connecting the dots to the climate. 
Consumers, misled by polluters and offered few nonpolluting vehicles and other products, end up declining to act in their long-term health interest. They have yet to put real 
pressure on government officials to adopt strong laws and regulations. Nor do they shun industries that fail to limit the burning of coal, petroleum and gas. 

In the near term, a president who ignores science has declared global warming a "hoax." His environmental rollbacks appear drawn up by the polluters. And virtually every 

Republican in Congress is a global warming denier. 
As the recent massive and shocking report issued by 13 federal agencies made clear, we face the environmental equivalent of the Great Depression. A climate adulterated by 
industry's carbon dioxide pollution -- two-thirds of it from transportation and power plants -- is already spreading tropical diseases, delivering rising seas, and fueling fierce 
hurricanes and wildfires. 

So, yes, an NRA-like structure is fine, but one modeled after the New Deal's NRA -- the National (Industrial) Recovery Act, which galvanized President Franklin Roosevelt's fight 
for economic recovery. That's what we need -- clean cars, clean energy and other solutions -- to tackle global warming.

Global warming is making us sick. 
The proportion of Earth's population that's vulnerable to heat-related death and disease continues to grow around the world because of human-caused climate change, 
according to a report released this week. 
"Climate change is a medical emergency," said report co-author Renee Salas, a doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. "It is truly harming the health 

of Americans and especially the most vulnerable … children, the elderly, minorities and the poor." 
Growing populations of older people, people living in cities and people with diseases are the prime reasons for the increasing vulnerability, according to the report, which was 

released Wednesday and published by The Lancet, a British medical journal. Last year, about 157million vulnerable people were exposed to heat waves globally. That's 18million more than in 2016. "We're seeing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves," said report co-author Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington. "As our populations age and as 
they move into cities that have got urban heat islands, we're seeing a large increase in the number of people who are vulnerable to high temperatures." 
She said another concern is that the potential geographic range of the mosquito, which can carry diseases such as dengue fever and Zika, has increased dramatically in higher temperatures. Climate change, aka global warming, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into 
the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors. 
The report, officially titled "The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change," said that in 2017, 153 billion hours of labor was lost worldwide because of heat exposure. 
In 2017, the report said, there were 16 extreme weather disasters in the USA, from powerful hurricanes to catastrophic wildfires, each of which caused more than $1 billion in 

damage and together cost more than $313 billion. 

"While each type of disaster poses different threats to human health, they all can lead to death," according to the report. "The official death toll was estimated at 3,278 lives, 
though the actual number is likely much higher, highlighting the need for better surveillance." 
In an editorial that accompanied the report, The Lancet warned that in the next few decades, "heatstroke and extreme weather will have redefined global labor and production 

beyond recognition. Multiple cities will be uninhabitable, and migration patterns will be far beyond those levels already creating pressure worldwide." 
The report was written by experts from 27 academic institutions, the United Nations and intergovernmental agencies from every continent.

Hot, dry future will mean more fires: Climate change makes conditions that spark blazes more common

The horrific wildfires in California this fall may be more commonplace as the planet warms: Climate change has doubled the odds that a region will suffer the brutal combination 
of hot and dry weather at the same time, a new study said. 
In addition to scorching and ruining crops, those hot, dry conditions can also worsen fire risk, drying out vegetation in the summer and fueling intense, fast-spreading wildfires 
like those that burned through more than 375 square miles in California this month, killing dozens. 

When those extremes occur at the same time, it exacerbates the impacts far beyond what they would have caused separately, according to study lead author Ali Sarhadi of 

Stanford University. 
The study makes intuitive sense since the Earth has warmed about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century: "If it's getting warmer everywhere, then it's more likely 
to be hot in two places at once," study co-author Noah Diffenbaugh said in a statement. He added that "it's probably also more likely to be hot when it's also dry in two places 
at once." 

Specifically, the frequency of warm and dry conditions happening at the same time in the mid-20th century was around 20 percent, the study said. Now, early in the 21st 

century, it's about 40 percent. 
"So, what used to be a rare occurrence can now be expected to occur with some regularity, and we have very strong evidence that global warming is the cause," Diffenbaugh, 
also of Stanford University, added. 

The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances. 
Looking ahead, within the next several decades, there's as much as a 75 percent chance that average temperatures will rise well beyond what they were around 1950. 
Food scarcity because of the hot, dry weather combination will likely affect the two most populated nations on Earth - China and India - both of which are particularly at risk: 

The probability of warm and dry years in these key crop and pasture regions will be substantially greater over the next 30 years if greenhouse gas emissions aren't reduced, the study authors say. 
Harvests of staple food crops such as wheat, rice, corn and soybeans could be threatened. 
Scientists say global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the 
atmosphere, and has caused global air and ocean temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors. 

The Stanford study follows a separate research paper published this week by the American Geophysical Union that said extreme heat events in both summer and winter are 
increasing across the U.S. and Canada.

Democrats will push on climate change: Policies could carry risk for leaders of new House

WASHINGTON - Capitol Hill Democrats who soon will run the House of Representatives are prioritizing climate change nearly a decade after their attempts to slow global warming helped whisk them out of power. 
Party leaders vowed to hold hearings on President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era climate rules and demanded internal documents on administration decisions to scale back restrictions on fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. 
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is vying to regain her role as House speaker, said she planned to revive a special congressional panel designed to examine climate change. The Select Committee on Energy Independence & Global Warming was shelved after Republicans took over the House in 2010. 
That urgency grew after the release Friday of a dire government report that climate change poses an increasing risk to the planet in the form of extreme weather, worsening health conditions, the spread of new diseases, increasing drought and famine and economic decline. 
Trump said Monday that he's not buying the National Climate Assessment's warning that the effects of global warming could reduce the nation's GDP by as much as 10 percent by 2100. 
"I don't believe it," he said when asked about the conclusions of the report, which was written by dozens of top scientists from 13 federal agencies in the Trump administration. 
Though they won back the House during the midterm elections by campaigning largely on health care, Democrats got the backing of environmental groups that poured tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns and registered liberal voters. 
The quandary for the party leaders when they take back power Jan. 3 is how aggressively to pursue an issue that contributed to the tea party wave that fueled the Republican takeover of the House in 2010. How prepared are they to address arguments that "alarmist" climate change policies would increase energy prices and reduce consumer choice? How willing are they to take on a president who was elected two years ago on an America First platform that promised to "bring back coal" as part of an energy independence agenda? 
For now, Democrats are content to build a case through fierce congressional oversight and the power to subpoena administration records, knowing that any major legislation they could pass probably would be vetoed by the president even if it got past the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Lawmakers led by incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., demanded documents related to Environmental Protection Agency proposals to let states regulate their power plants, freeze fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and roll back requirements on the power industry to check and repair methane leaks. 
"The tragic and human and financial costs of unchecked climate change are high and increasing fast, and unfortunately the administration's actions for the last two years are only exacerbating these conditions," Pallone wrote in a letter Nov. 20 to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. 
The emphasis on climate change - which Trump has labeled a "hoax" perpetrated by China - comes amid a cascade of scientific reports, including from the United Nations, that portend catastrophic social, economic and environmental consequences within decades if global temperatures keep rising. 
Effects are already being felt through stronger hurricanes, more intense wildfires, melting glaciers and loss of habitat, researchers say. 
The Trump administration has made expansion of fossil fuels, including more offshore oil and gas drilling and mining, a centerpiece of its energy and economic agenda. The president also pushed to undo Obama-era steps aimed at addressing climate change: proposing a new Clean Power Plan rule to give states more authority to regulate the industry; recommending a freeze on mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year; and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the international accord to gradually reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. 
"This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States," Trump said June 1, 2017, when he announced the withdrawal from the Paris accord. 
An EPA spokeswoman said the agency was reviewing Pallone's letter. 
David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said forcing records into the light of day could pressure the EPA to withdraw rules or Congress to pass laws if they show the agency selectively used information or improperly skewed cost-benefits analyses to favor the fossil fuels industry. 
"It's always important to know … more about the real influence and the real reasons and the real beneficiaries of these decisions," he said. "The public has a right to know that." 
Pelosi was speaker in 2009 when the chamber narrowly passed a "cap and trade" bill to address climate change. Portrayed by opponents as little more than an energy tax that 

would hit consumers' wallets, the measure never came up for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate and helped fuel the tea party wave that propelled Republicans to take 
control of the House in 2010. 
Some House Democrats are content with modest efforts to address global warming. 
"It's going to be, I think, more of an opportunistic strategy, where, in various pieces of legislation across the board, we're going to insert measures that address climate 

change," Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., co-chairman of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, told The Hill newspaper. 
Even if the House did pass an aggressive plan, it's doubtful the GOP-controlled Senate would take it up.

In Florence's wake, a mix of tragedy and lessons

Misguided policies maximize the impact of storms Hurricane Florence has brought immense flooding to many places, but particularly to the low-lying areas of southeastern North Carolina. One has to wonder what the people of these places did to deserve this. But one also has to wonder what we as a society are thinking. From the climate change denial prevalent in Washington to a federal flood insurance program that subsidizes development in flood-prone areas, it is almost as if policymakers are conceiving ways to make such storms more destructive. Even some things that occurred by happenstance — such as the region's growth as a storage site for pig waste and coal ash — seem like a plot against common sense. North Carolina is second only to Iowa in pork production, and most of its farms are in the very places that are under water, putting billions of pounds of waste held in lagoons at risk of spilling into waterways. The most glaring example of willful policy malfeasance has to be what is happening in the Trump administration as it pulls out of the Paris climate accord and softens regulations affecting everything from auto mileage standards to methane emissions. What planet do these people think they are on? It is certainly not the one in which shrinking polar ice fields are opening new shipping lanes, where rising sea levels in places like south Florida are creating sunny day flooding, and where a warming Atlantic is producing soggier storms like Florence. Adding to this head-in-the-sand approach on climate change is the misguided program known as the National Flood Insurance Program. Begun in 1968, it has encouraged building in flood-prone areas with premiums that greatly underestimate the risks. Since Hurricane Katrina broke its bank in 2005, the flood insurance program has run up a tab with the U.S. Treasury of $21 billion. Barring an unexpected, prolonged period of benign weather, this won't get paid back and taxpayers will be on the hook for the losses. In fact, the deficit is likely to grow larger. Florence is a massive storm and a huge tragedy for millions of people. It is also the latest example of the march of folly that is making matters worse. Stubborn stay-putters put first responders at risk It's as predictable as death and taxes. No matter the immensity of the hurricane bearing down and the urgency behind mandatory evacuation orders — 1.4 million were told to flee Florence's path — thousands of people in harm's way still try to ride out the storm. The result is a desperate whirlwind of water and air rescues — about a thousand and counting, so far, in North Carolina. The stranded are plucked off rooftops or out of flooded entryways by first responders duty bound to find stay-putters and carry them to safety. People refuse to evacuate for many reasons, researchers say. The disabled may simply be afraid or unable to leave their homes. Others don't have the means for a hotel or relatives to take them in, or they find community shelters unacceptable. A good many don't know what to do about their pets. In a search for answers, communities might explore voucher programs for easing the out-of-pocket costs for temporary relocation and incorporate sanctuaries for evacuated pets into disaster preparedness plans. Congress mandated the pet-friendly approach in 2006, but it has not been widely adopted. As a storm approaches, evacuees must be provided the best information on where shelters are located and how best to travel there. Even after any and all precautions, too many residents foolishly believe they can simply tough out a hurricane — in the case of Florence, perhaps because it was downgraded from a Category 4 at its peak to a Category 1 at landfall, despite warnings of catastrophic flooding that proved accurate. Tough love might be in order. As Hurricane Sandy bore down on New Jersey in 2012, residents who refused to leave were asked to fill out a form with instructions on how to notify next of kin. A good idea. Others were advised to write Social Security numbers on their arms in indelible ink. An even better idea. Why? So recovery crews could ultimately identify their corpses. Stubborn stay-putters should know their choice is profoundly selfish. They choose not just for themselves, but also for loved ones who might never see them again and, more important, for those who will risk life and limb to rescue them.

Matt Vespa, Townhall.com: "Global warming has consistently been ranked the least important issue with voters for years. This is an Acela Corridor concern, where rich liberals can whine and advocate about reducing carbon emission with zero economic blowback. For rural America, millions of Americans will be out of work. No job retraining will do any good … and economic growth and activity could be severely curtailed. The job losses would be staggering. We're the Saudi Arabia of coal, with enough to power our country and our economy for centuries. We're at our most industrialized in the U.S. and air quality couldn't be better. Sorry, the science is not settled on this matter. We're going to hear about extreme weather in the coming days -- and how President Donald Trump is some semi-God who conjured it out of thin air, or something -- but we had the calmest hurricane season in 30 years back in 2013. In that same year, we experienced the quietest tornado season in 60 years." Ned Barnett, The (Raleigh, North Carolina) News & Observer: "As Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas this week, Trump (said), 'We are absolutely and totally prepared.' He may be right about federal emergency readiness -- we'll see -- but he's plainly wrong about the nation's broader preparation for weather calamities. This president is doing the opposite of preparing. In the face of climate change that is clearly contributing to more powerful storms, droughts, floods, rising seas levels and wildfires, Trump is dropping the nation's guard. … In the next week or so, the president may be in North Carolina to survey the wreckage from Florence. But such damage in the future will be intensified by his own big wind that's upending efforts to avert climate change. Call it Hurricane Donald." Miami Herald, editorial: "When it comes to extreme weather, Trump is complicit. … With depressingly ironic timing, the Trump administration announced Tuesday a plan to roll back federal rules on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the main component in natural gas. Drillers and transporters of the fuel were supposed to be more careful about letting it waft into the atmosphere, which is nothing more than rank resource waste that also harms the environment. The Trump administration has now attacked all three pillars of President Barack Obama's climate-change plan. The president has cemented the GOP's legacy as one of reaction and reality denial. Sadly, few in his party appear to care."

The Trump administration is committed to saving coal, when what it really needs to do is save the planet. 
This week, the Environmental Protection Agency took another great leap backward, proposing new rules that are supposed to control heat-trapping greenhouse gas pollution but 
are really aimed at furthering the production and burning of coal. 
Power plants generate more than a quarter of the 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide America pumps into the atmosphere each year. And this summer, scorching California wildfires 

from tinder-dry conditions, along with record-breaking heat waves and flooding around the world, have been vivid testament to the extreme weather that global warming makes 

more likely. 
With the new rules proposed Tuesday, the EPA would junk the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which aimed to cut power sector emissions 30% from 2005 levels by 
2030, and would give states flexibility to meet mandatory goals. 

The best way to curb emissions would be a market-based tax on carbon, with revenue rebated to consumers. But the Clean Power Plan was a next-best alternative. 
The Trump plan would allow each state to choose how, or even whether, to set standards for coal-fired power plants. Pollution control upgrades would be reduced. 
Efficient coal burning would be encouraged, a move that could boost coal consumption, generating even more pollution. In addition to more carbon dioxide emissions, increases 

in microscopic airborne particulates could cause as many as 1,400 premature deaths each year. 
The Trump administration claims that its plan would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 33 to 34 percent below 2005 levels. But critics say this assumption merely piggybacks 

onto reductions -- of as much as 28% -- already attained by a power sector racing to embrace cheaper, cleaner natural gas and renewable sources such as wind and solar 
power. The true benefit of Trump's plan? A mere couple of percentage points of reduction, if that. 
All this to save a fuel source already in decline. Meanwhile, the fight to keep the globe from overheating catastrophically is turning into a capitulation. 
Besides trashing the Clean Power Plan, the president is pulling the United States out of a Paris climate accord that nearly 200 other nations signed, and he intends to roll back 

vehicle-efficiency standards aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions, the greatest domestic source of greenhouse gases. 

The new power plant rules and vehicle-efficiency rollbacks are likely to be tied up in court challenges for years. That might stall Trump's big retreat in the fight against human-induced climate change. But the nation needs to move forward, aggressively, in what is becoming an existential struggle.

WASHINGTON - Aging coal-fired power plants could get a new lease on life under an industry-friendly proposal by the Trump administration that would replace the Clean Power 
Plan, former President Barack Obama's signature plan to confront climate change. 
Unveiled Tuesday, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule would give states broad latitude in how they would regulate power plants' greenhouse gas emissions that contribute 
to global warming as well as other pollutants, such as smog, soot and mercury. 

"Today we are fulfilling the president's agenda. We are proposing a (plan) that promotes affordable, clean and reliable energy for all Americans," Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters Tuesday, adding that the Clean Power Plan "exceeded the agency's legal authority." 
But by the EPA's own admission, the proposal could lead to more than 1,000 premature deaths a year, a statistic opponents pounced on. 
"With today's Dirty Power Plan proposal, the Trump EPA once again proves that it cares more about extending the lives of old coal plants rather than saving the lives of the 
American people," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director of the Clean Air Task Force. 

Environmental groups and some states vowed to sue to stop the plan's implementation, just as opponents of Obama's Clean Power Plan have done. 

In a tweet, California Gov. Jerry Brown called the EPA proposal "a declaration of war against America and all of humanity" that will not go unanswered. 

The Clean Power Plan rule was finalized in 2015, mainly targeting coal-fired power plants that account for nearly 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. But it remains on 
hold under a Supreme Court stay pending the outcome of a legal challenge from states. 
In October, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rolled it back, carrying out a promise by Trump to push an energy agenda that encouraged the use of coal. The president, who has called global warming "a hoax" perpetrated by China to gain a competitive edge, wrote in a tweet May 18 that "we have ended the war on coal." Aimed squarely at coal-fired power plants, Obama's proposal would require existing power plants to cut harmful emissions based on 2005 levels. By 2030, the reduction would 
be 32 percent for carbon, 90 percent for sulfur dioxide and 72 percent for nitrogen oxides. 
Wheeler called the Obama plan "overly prescriptive and burdensome" and said it would have led to "double-digit" increases in electricity prices in up to 40 states, Wheeler told 
reporters on a conference call. EPA officials on the same call said consumer prices will fall slightly under the Trump plan by 2025. 
According to the EPA, the Trump plan would: 
Define the "best system of emission reduction" for existing power plants as on-site, heat-rate efficiency improvements. 
Provide states with a list of "candidate technologies" that can be used to establish standards of performance and be incorporated into their state plans. 
Update the New Source Review permitting program to further encourage "efficiency improvements" at existing power plants. 
Give "states adequate time and flexibility" to develop their own plans. 
Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which serves 42 million consumers nationwide, supports the plan. 
"The proposed rule appears to provide electric cooperatives with a more achievable plan that adheres to EPA's historic approach to using the Clean Air Act," he said in a 

statement. "This is necessary to provide electric co-ops the certainty and flexibility they need to meet their consumer-members' local energy needs." 
But environmental groups decried the plan as a sop to the coal industry at the expense of public health and the reality of climate change. 
Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator under Obama and an architect of the Clean Power Plan, called the Trump administration's move "a huge gimme to coal-fired power 

plants" by giving them a "free pass" to increase not just carbon emissions but other unhealthy pollutants as well. 
"They are continuing to play to their base, and they are following industry's playbook step by step," she told reporters. "This is all about coal at all costs."

Full Text 
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt "resigned" under great pressure from nearly every side. The real question is not that he is gone, but what took so long? He was the subject of more than 12 separate investigations for ethics violations, yet President Donald Trump hung on for a very long time, unwilling to cut the cord. Why? Well, it seems that Trump is very much like his core supporters who pledge unwavering loyalty to him. 
Trump totally liked the job Pruitt was doing at the EPA. And despite Pruitt's ethical transgressions, Trump was hesitant to let him go. 
It is fair to ask whether history will judge this period in the U.S. presidency as one more example of a time where people tolerated abhorrent words and deeds by their leader, as 
long as his policies were consistent with their own desires. The rest of us know that even if we like some of Trump's agenda, the trade-off is simply not worth it. 
Ken Derow 
Swarthmore, Pa. 
It would defy reason to suggest that replacing EPA administrator Scott Pruitt with the climate change denying, coal-apologist Andrew Wheeler will do anything but increase the 

amounts of dangerous pesticides in our foods and the levels of harmful air pollutants. 
The only way to reverse this administration's appalling march toward a more unhealthy, polluted and less-productive America, is for the majority of Americans -- Republicans 

and Democrats, alike -- to stand up against the president's reckless war on the regulations that for decades have protected the long-term health of our environment and 
economy. 
We know how to do that. 
For generations, responsible presidents and congressional leaders have supported science-based measures that properly put public health before corporate profits, steadily 

improving the quality of the air and water we all depend on. Without that, there will be no balance at all.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin laid out the Trump administration's recently released budget proposal at a Senate Finance Committee hearing Wednesday. It reflects 
President Trump's biggest priorities, such as a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, but it eliminates funding for other initiatives. 
Those include after-school programs, public broadcasting and a NASA space telescope. The budget goes to Congress, where last year, even key Republican lawmakers rejected 
many of the same cuts. 

Here are some of the eliminations proposed in the "Major Savings and Reforms" document. The savings are in comparison to 2017 funding, as listed in the document:

February 1968: Sen. Robert F. Kennedy visits students in rural Breathitt County, Ky., a region long left behind by economic prosperity. August 2017: President Trump rallies with supporters at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena in Huntington, W.Va. The line of big cars pulled up outside the one-room schoolhouse, which had a potbelly stove for heat and an outhouse in back. The senator burst in the door, followed by a pack 
of politicians, aides and journalists. Robert F. Kennedy had come to learn about rural poverty. Instead, his arrival petrified the students, who sat riveted to their ancient desks 
with their heads down, afraid to even look at the great man and his entourage. 
He sized up the problem. Instead of making a speech for the media, Kennedy moved quietly among the students, stopping to reassure them. He'd squeeze a hand, murmur in 
an ear. "What did you have to eat today?" he asked one girl. "I know you're scared," he told a boy, "but it's gonna be all right." 

Few who were there would forget how this powerful man reached those poor children with nothing but what the author William Greider, then of the Louisville Courier-Journal, 

would call "his physical humanity." 
That was almost 50 years ago -- Feb.13, 1968. Bobby Kennedy was a month from declaring for president and four months from an assassin's bullet. For two days, he met 
people as poor and isolated as he was rich and famous. Somehow, they clicked. 

Kennedy, heir to a fortune, "is now one of the faceless hungry," reported the Knoxville News Sentinel: Not since FDR's Depression-era campaigns in the South "had so many forlorn turned out with such hopeful enthusiasm." 
The implications were not lost on Peter Edelman, a Kennedy aide. "I was certain that these people would be Democrats their whole lives," he recalls, "and their children's lives." 
But no. Beginning in 2004, the six counties Kennedy visited began to shift Republican in presidential races. And in 2016, Donald Trump carried each with 70% to 80% of the 
vote. 

What was Kennedy country is Trump country. Children of Kennedy Democrats are Trump Republicans. And for those inspired by RFK in 1968, what should be a happy 
anniversary is instead an occasion to puzzle a drastic reversal of political fortune. 
RFK's 'poverty tour' 
By February 1968, the Vietnam War had soured. Kennedy felt intense pressure to challenge its prosecutor, President Lyndon Johnson, for re-election. 

In the midst of his agonized deliberations, he came here to study the effect of Johnson's 4-year-old War on Poverty. Eastern Kentucky had 20 of the nation's 30 poorest counties; coal mining, one of the few sources of prosperity the region had known, had begun its long decline. Many people lived in conditions not that different from those of their ancestors in the 19th century. 
At this point in his career, RFK's political reputation was for ruthlessness; he was John F. Kennedy's hatchet man in the 1960 presidential campaign. But he had been shattered 
by his brother's assassination. He could identify with people who were suffering. 
So it was in eastern Kentucky -- and the Mississippi Delta, the fields of California, the Indian reservations -- where he established a political tradition that his family, his party 
and his country have never quite forgotten. Cynics called it a "poverty tour." 

In two days, Kennedy traveled 200 miles, often over poorly paved, curving mountain roads, visiting places that had seldom seen anyone half as famous. 
People slipped paper for autographs through the slit in his car window and held children up to see him over the crowds. He had to shake so many hands his grip lost all strength. 

"This was history," says Dee Davis, who as a high school junior combed his hair like Kennedy and went to see him walk through Hazard's black neighborhood. "You wanted to be part of it." In a speech, Kennedy said: "I saw a family of six who have milk only one day a month. And many of the families we saw spend no more than 30 cents a day for a child for 
food." 
"I love these people," Kennedy told Greider. "It's terrible to have all this in a country as affluent as ours." 
On March 16, Kennedy entered the presidential race. Two weeks later, Johnson said he would not seek re-election. Early on June 5, hours after he won the California primary, 

Kennedy was shot in a Los Angeles hotel kitchen while shaking hands with a busboy. He died 24 hours later. 
A Kentucky stunner 
Nowhere was Donald Trump's 2016 election victory more striking than eastern Kentucky, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans and people of both parties fondly 

recall the Kennedy brothers. 

That includes two Republican Trump supporters: Tyler Ward, 32, a lawyer whose father, a Democrat, is the chief executive of Letcher County, and Colin Fultz, 46, an entrepreneur whose father was elected magistrate as a Democrat. Ward's grandfather was a "yellow dog" Democrat (he'd vote for a yellow dog before a Republican) who always said that Democrats care about people and Republicans care 
about money. "But now it seems the roles have been reversed," Ward says: Republicans care about people, like coal miners; Democrats care about intangibles, like climate change. 
How did Kennedy country become Trump country? The men would appear to share little more than a New York address and a Palm Beach tan. 
Kennedy in 1968 promised to use government help people; Trump in 2016 promised to get government off their backs. Kennedy promised to help miners recover from what he 
described as the irreversible decline of coal; Trump promised to bring coal back. 

Trump blamed others -- immigrants, environmentalists, the Chinese -- for America's problems. Kennedy blamed Americans: "How can we allow this?" he asked of hunger here. 

And neither would seem to be to the taste of mountain people, who, rendered cynical by many unmet political promises, "will tell you real quick to go kiss your ass," says Steve 
Cawood, who as a young law student accompanied Kennedy. 
50 years later, mixed progress 
Fifty years later, eastern Kentucky is more prosperous. Fewer than a quarter of residents live below the poverty line, compared with more than half 50 years ago. There are 

four-lane highways, regional hospitals and Wal-Marts. 

But the six counties Kennedy visited are among the sickest in one of the nation's sickest states, and an epicenter of the opioid epidemic. Rates of premature death and infant 
mortality are roughly twice the nation's. 
Many of the kids in the Barwick class that Kennedy visited had to move away to find work. Several who stayed died of drug overdoses. One killed himself. 
The schoolhouse was closed in the early '70s and today is a ruin; the county librarian calls Barwick itself "almost a mountain ghost town." 
Recently, Bonnie Jean Carroll, who taught the class, returned to visit the school. She's 82, a lifelong Democrat. She thinks about Kennedy and what might have been: "He was 

concerned about us. He wanted to help. If he'd survived " 
She looks at a photo of her class and sees all the missing faces.

Full Text 
Does your family have a "thing"? A particular hobby that you bond over, passing traditions, jokes and maybe even equipment down from one generation to the next? For my family, it's skiing. I was only 2 when my dad, who ran a ski school, started teaching me to ski. Now that I have a daughter of my own, I can't wait for her to learn to walk -- so I can teach her to ski! 
But by the time she grows up, and has kids of her own to teach to ski at entirely too young an age (as per family tradition), there could be a whole lot less snow around. If we do not find the courage to kick our fossil fuel addiction and transition to clean energy, we will warm the atmosphere to the extent that areas typically covered in white all winter long could see only sporadic snow. 
For example, a study released last year found that by 2050, when my daughter will hopefully be putting my grandchildren on skis, the snow season across the USA could be cut in half. By 2090, when her children are raising their children, there could be as much as an 80% reduction in ski season length (costing the winter sports and recreation industry hundreds of millions of dollars). 
The story is the same across the globe. Recent analysis of 21 cities that have held the Winter Olympics found that nearly half won't be reliably cold enough to host them again by mid-century. Though snow machines have already proved able to take up some of nature's slack in keeping runs covered, before long many past host cities just won't be cold enough to sustain the snow and ice necessary to host again. 
That's not only a loss for those of us who carry on family traditions inseparable from the snow, but also a huge blow to the economies of so many mountain towns. Nationwide, the snow sports economy generates $73billion annually. From lift tickets to hotel rooms to restaurant meals, our rural mountain economies rely on snow as their currency. 
Fortunately, a melted future is by no means what has to happen. Though it will take a whole lot of effort, limiting warming to the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of the Paris climate agreement is still a possibility. Wind and solar power are getting cheaper and cheaper. Scientists are constantly improving how long batteries to store renewable energy can hold a charge, how quickly they can be recharged, and how cheaply they can be purchased. 
There is no escape from using fossil fuels in our lives today; they are woven into the fabric of modern society. We each inherently have a carbon footprint, and even though reducing that footprint is a good step forward, it's not enough. We need to change the system. When we turn on our lights, we need that energy to come from clean sources, created without fossil fuels that cause so much carbon pollution. 
The solutions are here. We just need to embrace them. 
That means voting for politicians who will increase funds for clean energy and energy efficiency -- not propose drastic cuts. Research shows the vast majority of Americans want the government to invest in green energy and to limit our carbon pollution. But as long as our elected officials continue to prioritize coal, oil and gas, our emissions will continue to grow and our winters will continue to shrink. 
And if you don't love winter as much as I do, then I'll just remind you that along with fewer snow days, we'll also be getting more extreme heat. For every degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit) the planet warms, we could see as many as 34 additional days of heat waves per season. 
And without a decent snowpack, especially in the West, our rivers and reservoirs will store less and less water that we so desperately need in the warmer months. 
A world where everyone's sweating for an extra month or two, and with far fewer days to chill out on the slopes, is not the inheritance I want for my daughter. What about you?

Global temperatures could surpass a limit set by the Paris climate agreement within the next five years, according to a new forecast by British scientists. 
At least one year in the next five could exceed the threshold the deal set of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, according to the forecast from the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service. It's now likely temperatures will exceed 1 degrees Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, as soon as 2022. 
"It is the first time that such high values have been highlighted within these forecasts," the Met Office said. 
The Paris agreement aims to limit warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius by gradually reducing emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which come from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas. 
Global average temperatures have neared the 1 degree Celsius mark over the past three years. That combined with warming from greenhouse gases and natural variations in temperatures means it's possible for the world surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius mark in the next five years, said Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office. 
"We are now starting to see a small but real chance of temporarily exceeding the 1.5 degree Celsius level, but we should remember that the Paris agreement is about the global climate reaching this level over a longer-term average, rather than just a temporary excursion," Doug Smith of the Met Office said. 
Last year was the world's hottest non-El Nio year on record, both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA reported in January. El Nio is a natural warming of ocean water in the Pacific that boosts global temperatures. 
Both agencies said the past four years have been the hottest since records began in the late 1800s. The most recent cooler-than-average year was 1976. Since then, the globe has experienced a stretch of 41 consecutive warmer-than-average years.

President Trump and tax cuts are a success: It is time to give the president a fair shake

Abstract

Full Text 
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently tweeted, "Which is the more underreported story of @POTUS year one? Defeat of ISIS. Booming Trump economy" 
She asked the question for good reason. The good news of Trump's presidency hasn't received much attention. According to the Media Research Center, coverage of Trump on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts in September, October and November was more than 90% negative. Granted, the president is partially at fault for the lack of positive coverage. At times, he has stepped all over his message. Plus, attacking news reports as "fake news" is not the 
way to win friends and influence the press. 
Trump supporters cry foul, but just like a coach who throws a chair or blasts the media in a news conference, the outburst tends to get more attention than it does wins. 
Trumpsters aren't the only ones who've noticed how the media treat Trump. Surprisingly, 93-year-old former president Jimmy Carter told New York Times columnist Maureen 

Dowd: "I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about." 

Are Trump's wins underreported? Ross Douthat, writing in The Times this month on the ISIS defeat, said "the media is not adequately reporting an important success because it 
does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested." 
Other Trump wins this year include: 
Tax cuts: Congress has passed a tax overhaul, but just the anticipation of tax reform, which will cut the corporate rate to 21%, has excited business owners and fueled stock 

market records. 
Economic growth: The gross domestic product has grown by more than 3% for two quarters in a row. 
Consumer confidence: In October, consumer confidence rose to the highest level in 17 years, according to the New York-based Conference Board. 
Deregulation: Trump has cut 67 Obama-era regulations and added only three new rules. The rollback has spurred business confidence, economic activity and stock market 

growth. Trump said the actions have saved $8.1 billion in lifetime net regulatory costs. 
Stock market: The Dow has set record highs 70 times this year, rising 5,000 points in a year for the first time in history. 
Judicial appointments: Trump has staffed the judiciary with constitutionalists such as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. 
Unemployment: Trump inherited low unemployment from President Obama, but the number of people collecting unemployment benefits has continued to fall to a near 44-year 

low. 
Trade: Trump secured a trade deal with China, Vietnam and South Korea. 
Israel: The United States' relationship with Israel has been much improved since the last administration. 
Immigration: In August, illegal border crossing apprehensions were down 41% on the Southern border compared with August 2016. 

U.S. energy: The Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines are under construction. Jobs to be created: 42,000. 
Coal: Trump stopped Obama's war on coal. 
Climate change: Trump said he will withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement because it would undermine our economy. 
Schools: Trump is giving the green light to school choice programs. 
Obamacare: The new tax law repeals its individual mandate. 

Of course, the left credits Obama for ISIS' defeat and the booming economy. And Obama recently thanked himself for economic growth and job creation in a speech to mayors in Chicago. 
Actually, he deserves some credit. His policies created a slow recovery, which forced businesses to get lean. Trump has removed the regulatory weight and the economy is soaring. 
Trump's combative style reminds me of a certain three-time national champion basketball coach from Indiana. But like that coach, Trump has more wins than losses.

Administrator aims to reshape EPA culture: Pruitt opens advisory boards to industry voices

Abstract

Full Text 
WASHINGTON - EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt isn't just dismantling the Clean Power Plan and other high-profile environmental programs of the Obama era. He's on a mission to 
re-engineer the agency's culture by returning power to states and away from the Washington bureaucrats and coastal elites he said have led it astray. 
The EPA is doing away with the "sue-and-settle" approach that Pruitt said improperly allowed the Obama administration to circumvent laws by rewriting regulations behind 
closed doors with friendly environmental groups who filed lawsuits. 

The agency has rewritten membership rules for the agency's advisory boards, so industry advocates and academics from Midwestern and mountain states -- which Pruitt said 

were under-represented -- have greater influence when counseling leaders on new regulations. 
He's adopted a "red team/blue team" model designed to challenge climate change assumptions that global warming is occurring and humans are the primary cause -- a view 
endorsed by the majority of scientists and by a report the White House issued this month. 

Pruitt, who challenged the Clean Power Plan as Oklahoma attorney general, said he's plowing ahead with the rollback of the rule designed to curb carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants despite the report's conclusions. 
He said the red team/blue team approach is integral to the rigorous self-analysis the EPA has been lacking in recent years. 
"I'm an attorney. I believe in bringing people together in an open process to encourage peer review. That's what science is," Pruitt said. "We shouldn't run from that. That's 
something we ought to embrace as a culture and, I think, as an agency." 

Of all Pruitt's moves to reshape an agency whose authority he frequently challenged in court, the red team/blue team strategy has raised some of the loudest alarm bells among 

his critics who consider it an attack on science. 
The exercise was designed at the height of the Cold War to assess Soviet reactions to various scenarios. And that's where it belongs -- not to relitigate the facts of climate 
science, said former New Jersey GOP governor Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the EPA under President George W. Bush. 

"That Mr. Pruitt seeks to use the power of the EPA to elevate those who have already lost the argument is shameful, and the only outcome will be that the public will know less 
about the science of climate change than before," she wrote in The New York Times.

Germany falters on climate change leadership

Full Text 
After President Trump irresponsibly vowed in May to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that other world 
powers would continue fighting the good fight against global warming. 
"We are more determined than ever that this be a success," Merkel later said of the accord, which employs voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to curtail human-
caused warming. "We can't wait for the last man on Earth to be convinced by the scientific evidence for climate change." 

Indeed, with Nicaragua and Syria now joining the Paris Agreement, the United States would be the world's only holdout among nearly 200 nations. So the leadership of Merkel, as chancellor of the world's fourth largest economy and sixth largest carbon emitter, is paramount if the planet is to rein in rising temperatures. 
But German resolve is faltering, and it couldn't come at a worse time. 
For a few years, it seemed as if the world's nations -- gushing more than 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year into an already overheating atmosphere -- might have 
peaked on emissions. 

Not so. Projections by the Global Carbon Project this month show that after three years of stabilized emissions even as the global economy grew, the output of greenhouse 

gases will rise by 2% this year and continue increasing in 2018. 
This is bad news for the planet. To even begin meeting Paris goals of capping global temperature at no more that 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre­industrial levels, fossil fuel emissions must not only stabilize but also start falling sharply. 

With American leadership sidelined, thanks to a president who once called global warming a hoax, the world needs the "climate chancellor." Former scientist Merkel earned that 

name for her laser focus on global warming. She was a key architect, first of European Union emission reduction targets and later of the Paris Agreement. 
But her own house is not in order, largely because of an addiction to coal burning that also afflicts the U.S., China and other nations. Germany's carbon dioxide emissions rose in 
2016 and are projected to grow again this year. 

Forty percent of Germany's energy is from burning coal, particularly a dirty variant known as lignite easily extracted through open-pit mining. Coal reliance is partly a result of Germany's foolhardy decision to end nuclear power. Berlin is also intimidated by voters in Germany's coal country. So Germany will fall far short of its 2020 goal to reduce emissions by 40% below 1990 levels, a result that an internal government document says will be "a disaster for Germany's international reputation as a climate leader." 
At this point, the battle to control global warming needs all the leaders it can get.

One year ago, the European Union ratified the Paris Agreement and pledged to reduce its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 40% relative to 1990. Emissions have already dropped by 23% in 2016 -- on track to meet the 2030 target. Germany, the EU's largest economy, has reduced emissions by 28% and is contributing significantly and above par to the EU's common goal. 
In 2016, the share of renewables in all electricity produced in Germany reached a new all-time high of almost 32% (vs. 15% in the United States). Solar, wind and biomass have allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint by 160million tons of carbon dioxide, or roughly the annual emissions of the U.S. state of Georgia. 
Even so, recent estimates also show that German emissions have gone up slightly, by 0.4% last year. What happened and what does this mean? 
Apart from the wind and sun, Germany's primary domestic source of energy has been coal. In the integrated European electricity market, our coal-fired power plants do not just fill the gap on cloudy days but also export record amounts of excess electricity to our neighbors. But Germany's major political forces agree on a phaseout in the medium term: By law, the first five plants will go offline by 2019. 
Just as coal was essential for Germany's industrialization in the 19th century, renewables are powering our businesses and jobs in the 21st. For Germany's manufacturers, the digital and the energy transformation are two sides of the same coin: Eventually, coal will go the way of the typewriter. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel called climate change the "key challenge for humanity" when speaking to delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn last week. An overwhelming majority of Germans agree and support an ambitious energy transition to keep our manufacturing base competitive. The message to the world is clear: Together with our partners, we are not shying away from challenges but working to solve them in the framework of the Paris Agreement.

WASHINGTON - EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said a newly released government report that lays most of the blame for the rise of global temperatures on human activity won't deter him from rolling back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a rule aimed at combating climate change. 
"We're taking the very necessary step to evaluate our authority under the Clean Air Act, and we'll take steps that are required to issue a subsequent rule. That's our focus," Pruitt told USA TODAY on Tuesday. "Does this report have any bearing on that? No, it doesn't. It doesn't impact the withdrawal, and it doesn't impact the replacement." 
Last month, the Trump administration began the formal process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan intended to curb carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Pruitt, who sued to block it as Oklahoma's attorney general, said Congress never gave the Obama administration the authority to implement such a sweeping regulation. 
In his first public comments since the Trump administration released the National Climate Assessment on Friday, Pruitt said a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court last year to suspend the regulation until legal challenges are resolved "created great uncertainty" about the regulatory framework. 
The EPA is drafting a replacement rule that will have to be legally defensible as environmental groups threaten legal action. 
"Our job is to administer statutes," Pruitt said, explaining the limits of what the EPA can do. "We have to act (based) on the authority given to us by Congress." 
President Trump has dismissed climate change as a "hoax" perpetrated by the Chinese to gain a competitive edge over the United States. A champion of the coal industry, Trump followed through on his vow to undo the climate change agenda implemented under President Obama by pulling out of the Paris Accord and withdrawing the Clean Power Plan. The EPA, under Pruitt's direction, has been at the forefront of that effort. 
David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, criticized the EPA administrator for abandoning the power rule, saying the Supreme Court has recognized the EPA's authority to curb carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. 
"The National Climate Assessment has sounded a five-alarm fire bell, and Scott Pruitt pretends he can't hear it," he said. "The assessment shows unequivocally that carbon pollution is causing dangerous climate change and that our future depends on whether we cut that pollution."

The Clean Power Plan was the wrong answer to a real concern. 
To be clear, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes that the climate is changing, and that man is contributing to these changes. We also believe that technology and innovation, rather than sweeping federal mandates, offer the best approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. 
American businesses have led and will continue to lead the world to a cleaner energy future. In the past few decades, we've developed emissions-free nuclear power, pioneered new techniques to extract cleaner natural gas, lowered emissions from coal, and decreased the costs of wind and solar. Industry, states and the federal government have partnered to reduce major pollutant levels 67% since 1980, and carbon dioxide emissions have declined to their lowest levels since 1994 despite continued population growth. 
In contrast, the Clean Power Plan sought to regulate not only the electricity sector but also large swaths of the economy. The legal challenge, led by the Chamber and 28 states, was one of the broadest in history; the Supreme Court issued an unprecedented stay to block the plan's implementation. 
The plan's fundamental flaw was that it would have intentionally raised the cost of energy without regard to the impact on families and businesses. Sacrificing affordable and reliable energy would cede one of America's most important advantages in the global marketplace. Dramatically different requirements on each state would have left many facing major economic hardships and compliance challenges. 
Instead of making some energy sources more expensive, we should be expanding alternatives, and making all forms of energy cleaner and more affordable. Any productive climate conversation recognizes that there are other options besides Washington mandates. Business will continue to lead by bringing innovation, technology and ingenuity to this challenge. 
Karen Harbert is CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute.

As globe warms, Trump doubles down on fossil fuels

As if any more evidence were needed that climate change is making extreme heat more likely, take a look at what happened in Southern California last week. On Tuesday at Dodger Stadium, the first-pitch temperature for the opening game of the World Series was a record-shattering 103 degrees. 
And how is the Trump administration responding to the warning signs of global warming? By systematically dismantling the Obama administration's environmental initiatives. 
Just five months ago, President Trump broke with nearly 200 other countries in taking the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, a stunning move given that the accord regulated nothing, relying only on peer pressure and transparency to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
Now the Trump administration is turning its attention to gutting the Clean Power Plan, the 2015 Obama initiative aimed at curbing greenhouse gases from energy plants. This latest effort to kill the Clean Power Plan demonstrates sheer contempt for laws governing clean air and the benefits of environmental regulation. 
Power plants generate about a third of the 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide America pumps into the atmosphere each year. The Clean Power Plan offered each state a flexible pathway to reducing these emissions by a third. The plan was the next best idea to a market-based carbon tax that would be rebated to consumers. 
Yes, it would undoubtedly result in less burning of coal, the dirtiest fuel. But coal was in decline even without new environmental regulations as utilities embraced cleaner natural gas, wind and solar. 
U.S. coal mining jobs have fallen to fewer than 77,000, while those in renewable energy have hit 800,000 and keep increasing. Some of the nation's largest power companies this month shrugged off Trump's regulatory rollback, arguing that clean energy has proved to be good business. 
The Supreme Court narrowly ruled last year to temporarily block implementation of the plan amid challenges that it represented regulatory overreach. An appellate panel can still reach a decision and should do so. 
Regardless, the Environmental Protection Agency remains compelled by law to reduce carbon dioxide. A 2007 Supreme Court ruling established the gas as a pollutant subject to reduction if EPA found it a danger to public health. The EPA did that two years later, after reviewing the scientific evidence. 
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's proposal for dismantling the Clean Power Plan mentions drafting a new method for reducing carbon dioxide. We'll believe that when we see it. 
If there's any good news, it's that the Clean Power Plan -- or some similar action to significantly reduce greenhouse gases gushing from the nation's electricity sector -- is likely to survive this effort at sabotage. But that might take years of bureaucratic and legal wrangling, consuming precious time as the planet grows warmer.

The Trump administration's move to start dismantling the Clean Power Plan intended to curb carbon emissions that contribute to global warming will not be a quick process. 
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's announcement Sunday to a group of coal miners in eastern Kentucky that he plans to sign a proposed rule Tuesday rolling back the Obama-era rule is the first of a number of steps the agency will have to take. 
Proposing a rule to undo a regulation takes the same time-consuming, painstaking, research- based, legally defensible process used to adopt the rule targeted for elimination. 
"Today's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan just begins the battle," David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote in a blog Monday. "Pruitt's EPA must hold hearings and take public comment, and issue a final repeal -- with or without a possible replacement. He must respond to all legal, scientific and economic objections raised, including the issues we lay out here." 
Then, Doniger said, "we will take Pruitt and his Dirty Power Plan to court." 
Rolling back the rule was a major plank of President Trump's campaign last year. 
He told friendly crowds in coal-producing states that lifting carbon restrictions would not only keep energy costs affordable but also help revitalize the coal industry and the communities economically ravaged by environmental regulations. 
The president has called climate change a "hoax" perpetrated by China to gain a competitive advantage. He vowed to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the international accord on global warming Obama embraced through his power plan rule. 
The budget outline the White House issued this year called for defunding the Clean Power Plan that Obama announced in 2015, which about two dozen states sued to overturn. Oklahoma, where Pruitt served as attorney general before joining the Trump administration, is one of those states. 
In Hazard, Ky., Sunday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Pruitt announced his plan to withdraw the rule, saying Washington would no longer play favorites when it comes to energy production. 
"When you think about the Clean Power Plan, it wasn't about regulating to make things regular," he said. "It was truly about regulating to pick winners and losers, and they interpreted the best system of emission reduction is generating electricity not using fossil fuels. Rule of law matters. Because rule of law is something that allows you to know what is expected of you. When you have a regulation passed inconsistent with the statute, (it) creates uncertainty. That's what happened with the past administration. We're getting back to the basics of focusing on rule of law and acting on the authority that Congress has given us." 
The Clean Power Plan was finalized in 2015, mainly targeting coal-fired power plants that account for nearly 40% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. It remains on hold under a Supreme Court stay, pending the outcome of the legal challenge from the states. 
The regulation would require power plants to cut harmful emissions compared with 2005 levels. By 2030, the reduction would be 32% for carbon, 90% for sulfur dioxide and 72% for nitrogen oxides. 
The rule was developed over years to cut "significant amounts of power plant carbon pollution and the pollutants that cause the soot and smog that harm health, while advancing clean energy innovation, development and deployment and laying the foundation for the long-term strategy needed to tackle the threat of climate change," according to an explanation from Obama's EPA website. 
Obama officials touted the rule as key to protecting public health "because carbon pollution comes packaged with other dangerous air pollutants." Having the rule in place, the site said, would prevent 3,600 premature deaths, 1,700 heart attacks, 90,000 asthma attacks and 300,000 missed workdays and school days each year. 
"This is a reckless retreat that will hurt our children and grandchildren," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
State lawsuits contend that Washington does not have the authority to enact such a sweeping measure, which would lead to higher electricity costs and reduced reliability of the nation's power grid. 
When the rule was implemented in 2015, New Jersey Commissioner of Environmental Protection Bob Martin called it "unprecedented regulatory overreach (that was) uncommonly cumbersome, difficult and costly to implement, could undermine reliability and would yield insufficient results." 
Paul Bailey, president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, applauded the president this year when he signed an executive order directing the EPA to begin the process of reviewing and rescinding the controversial rule. 
"The Clean Power Plan is the poster child for regulations that are unnecessarily expensive and would have no meaningful environmental benefit," Bailey said. "We look forward to working with EPA Administrator Pruitt."

My heart goes out to those in Texas who have been displaced, lost their homes or even their lives to Hurricane Harvey. Unfortunately, storms like this one will become much more frequent unless our nation takes significant action on climate change. It's true that Texas has always had storms (as has the East Coast, and Florida specifically). But it's the frequency and severity that the combination of rising temperatures and 
sea levels is pushing forward. A solution is needed that bridges the partisan divide. 
One such solution is a fee on carbon emissions, collected from the source (such as coal plants) then eventually returned to the community. This is a market- and business-friendly plan quite similar to one being proposed by some in Capitol Hill. Our children's and grandchildren's future depends on what we do now, so we don't have many more large disasters like Harvey in Texas. Contact your representatives and ask 
them to support a carbon fee and dividend legislation.

Just think, if we had a national water grid, we could have turned on the pumps at key collection points and distributed it to reservoirs around the country. Maybe after this, we 

can think of ways to turn this horrible event into a call for action that just might save billions in future floods, drought and fires.

President Trump had barely settled into the Oval Office in January when he signed executive orders opening the door for construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. 
He was just getting started. 
In the following weeks, the Trump administration lifted a moratorium on coal leasing on federal land; blocked regulations on power-plant carbon emissions; overturned a ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean; delayed rules intended to prevent methane leaks from oil and gas wells; and announced plans for the U.S. to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. 
Trump's promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act suffered a stunning defeat in Congress, and the prospects for his tax-reform pledge are far from certain. But when it comes to energy policy, the administration has managed to forge ahead on initiatives aimed at not only making the U.S. energy independent but turning it into a dominant energy force. 
"These are consequential changes in the sense that they move energy policy in a new direction -- essentially a 180-degree turn from where we had been less than a year ago," said David Konisky, an energy expert at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. 
Much of Trump's early focus has been on dismantling rules and regulations put in place by President Obama to protect the environment, fight climate change and make the country less dependent on fossil fuels. 
Trump has succeeded in moving his energy agenda forward because he has been able to use administrative actions rather than waiting to build consensus in Congress, Konisky said. 
Environmental groups and others, however, are challenging many of Trump's attempts. 
This month, a federal appeals court in Washington ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce an Obama-era rule limiting the amount of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, that can be emitted from new or modified oil and gas wells. 
The administration can expect other legal challenges, said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "This administration is the biggest threat to the health of our planet," he said. "Resisting this administration is a top priority for the Sierra Club for now and the foreseeable future." 
What's more, watchdog groups say, Trump is filling his administration with people with ties to the energy sector. Michael Catanzaro, Trump's special assistant for domestic energy and environmental policy, has worked as a lobbyist for several oil and gas companies. This month, Trump nominated Michael Menezes and Paul Dabbar, both of whom have personal investments in energy companies, as undersecretaries in the Energy Department. Several other appointees in the Energy and Interior departments also have worked for or lobbied on behalf of energy interests.

The federal government confirmed 2016 as the planet's warmest year on record, according to a report released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
The combined influence of long-term global warming and a strong El Nio early in the year led to last year's all-time record heat, NOAA said. 
El Nio is a natural warming of Pacific Ocean water. Man-made global warming is caused by greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels such 
as oil, gas and coal. 

The amount of carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere climbed to its highest level in 800,000 years, the report found. 
The report noted other signs of a warming planet in 2016: 
Greenhouse gases were the highest on record. 
Sea-surface temperatures were the highest on record. 
Global upper ocean heat content was at a near-record high. 
Global sea level was the highest on record. 
Antarctic had a record low sea ice extent. 
Known as the State of the Climate, the annual report is prepared by more than 450 scientists from more than 60 countries and published in conjunction with the American 

Meteorological Society. It's the most comprehensive annual summary of Earth's climate. 

The USA endured 15 separate weather or climate-related disasters last year. At a cost of about $46 billion, it amounted to the second-highest total since 1980, when the records 
began. 
The report came days after President Trump officially informed the United Nations of his plan to remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement, which the 

government joined in 2016. Trump announced his plan to withdraw on June 1. That agreement aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 

degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. 
A separate study published Thursday found it is "extremely unlikely" that 2014, 2015 and 2016 would have been the warmest consecutive years on record without the influence 
of human-caused climate change. 

That study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Geophysical Research Letters, said the likelihood of seeing three straight record-breaking years without the effects of climate 

change is "no greater than 0.03%." 
"With climate change, this is the kind of thing we would expect to see. And without climate change, we really would not expect to see it," said Michael Mann, a climate scientist 
at Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the study.

GOP loosens government grip on land: 'Energy dominance' policy wants areas open to development

Full Text 
As the new Republican-dominated House convened in early January, anticipating the arrival of President Trump, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee declared it time for a "paradigm shift" in how the more than 25% of the country that is owned by the federal government is managed. 
Almost eight months into a Republican-led effort, that shift is underway. 
On the first day of the new Congress, Republicans passed a rule that made it easier to make conveyances of federal land by treating such transfers as cost-free even if they would potentially cause losses of revenue from mining or drilling rights. 
Days after Trump took office, then-congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah introduced legislation that would have disposed of 3.3 million acres of public land in 10 Western states. After irate calls and protests, he withdrew the bill days later. 
In March, the new Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, repealed a January 2016 moratorium on new coal leases on federal land by the Bureau of Land Management before a planned three-year environmental assessment -- that would have looked into "the social cost of carbon" -- could be completed. 
In April, the president asked Zinke to study the size of national monuments made since 1996 by presidential fiat under the Antiquities Act. The review was in the context of a new policy of "energy dominance" and the planned acceleration of resource extraction from public lands. 
In June, Zinke, a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL, said the department would postpone elements of the methane rule that requires energy companies to capture the natural gas on public lands rather than flaring it off, the standard industry practice. 
In a meeting in July with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Zinke said he planned to implement the energy dominance Trump called for by requiring his department to reach faster decisions on leases and permits on federal land and becoming a partner with extraction industries rather than an adversary. Mulvaney said the Interior was "leading the way" in the deregulation Trump advocates. 
Zinke's views on the evolving Republican House public lands strategy are complicated. He said he wants to be a good steward and opposes turning over federal land to local or state governments or private interests. His justification for delaying full implementation of the methane rule wasn't so much that it was bad public policy, since it would stop wasting a public resource that could generate revenue, but balancing that goal with the cost to the industry. 
Though raising revenue from public lands is in tune with the goals of House Republicans such as Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop of Utah, Zinke is not entirely on board with all their agenda. When Republicans convened their national convention in Cleveland last summer, the platform committee agreed to a policy of providing "an orderly mechanism requiring the federal government to convey certain federally controlled lands to the states." Zinke, a member of the committee who disagreed with the policy statement, walked out. 
Zinke told senators at his confirmation hearing, and in several public appearances since, that one of his heroes is Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican president who doubled the number of national parks and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act. At a White House roundtable with reporters in July, Zinke talked of lessons learned from John Wesley Powell, who surveyed the West with the U.S. Geological Survey in the late 1890s, and Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U.S. Forest Service from 1905 to 1910. 
The Interior secretary, comfortable making the rounds in wrinkled jeans and a cowboy hat, is steeped in the history of his department but devoted to the mission to make the country's natural resources pay. 
David Bernhardt, Zinke's deputy, is an oil and gas lobbyist and lawyer whose clients have included Halliburton Energy Services, the company once run by former vice president Dick Cheney; Rosemont Copper, which seeks a permit to mine in Arizona; and Cadiz, which seeks access to the aquifer water under the Mojave Desert, according to the environmental activist group Greenpeace's "Polluter Watch" project. 
Also on staff is Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason, who notified several members of the senior executive staff in June that they were being reassigned. One, director of policy analysis Joel Clement, the department's specialist on Arctic climate change, was reassigned to an office handling oil lease royalty payments. He wrote a Washington Post op-ed saying that he was being retaliated against and that the transfer was intended to make him quit. Cason held Interior jobs under George W. Bush and was involved in minerals management under Ronald Reagan. 
After learning of the reassignments, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and seven other Democratic senators wrote to the Interior Department's inspector general, saying the suggestion that the executives were moved to silence or "punish them for the conscientious performance of their duties is extremely troubling and calls for the closest examination." The senators called the transfers "a serious act of mismanagement" and "an abuse of authority." 
Soon after he was named, the department's principal deputy solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, was called as a witness before Bishop's Natural Resources Committee oversight hearing June 28 to examine the impact of "excessive litigation" filed against the department. The committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, questioned the entire premise of the hearing. 
Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., sought to discredit environmental activists and those implementing consent decrees. . "An objective would be essentially collusion between litigants and ideological zealots in the bureaucracy to achieve a foregone or fore-ordained conclusion by court order that they know they couldn't get by regulation or by law," he suggested. Jorjani said he would not make any assumptions about intentions or characterize parties as zealots. 
In his written testimony, Jorjani said settlements can be "useful and beneficial" by saving taxpayer money and are reviewed by federal judges to assure they're entered into in the public interest. 
"Judges are already empowered to deal with litigation that is without merit or frivolous, including the authority to punish attorneys for pursuing abusive litigation," Grijalva said. "The number of cases where courts use that authority is small, and it happens no more often with environmental litigation than in other kinds of cases." 
Witness Lois Schiffer, a former general counsel to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that in her experience, government lawyers take their ethical obligations seriously and "do not collude." 
Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said a "blanket statement that government lawyers don't collude is a false statement because they're humans." 
Bishop has championed Western land use issues since he was a state legislator in the early 1990s before bringing his cause to Washington. In May, Bishop's committee looked at what it called "executive branch overreach of the Antiquities Act" to make the case for more local approval before designations are made. A 13-page memorandum to the Budget Committee this year contains his case for the proposed "paradigm shift," as well as calling for $50 million to facilitate conveyances of federal land to state, local and tribal governments. 
Besides wanting to diminish the size of national monuments, Bishop opposes acquiring additional lands until those the government manages are put in order. The Interior oversees the national parks, which have $12 billion in deferred maintenance. 
The entire Utah congressional delegation, including Bishop, objected when President Obama declared the Bears Ears national monument in December, weeks before leaving office.

Wildfires a harbinger of global warming

LETTERS Many people are concerned about global warming but assume that its predicted damages will come well enough in the future that there will be plenty of time to deal with it later. This mindset is naive and dangerous. Wildfires are a case in point. The startling increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires is strongly linked to global warming. So 
far, average temperatures in the western U.S. have risen less than 2 degrees Fahrenheit, yet wildfires are occurring nearly four times more often, burning more than six times the land area, and lasting almost five times as long. By mid-century, summertime temperatures are projected to be 3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit higher, enhancing evaporation rates, while precipitation is expected to decrease by 
up to 15%. Warmer and drier conditions will lead to widespread beetle and other insect infestations, resulting in broad ranges of dead and highly combustible trees. The costs in human life and health, property damage and state and federal dollars are devastating and will only get worse. Unless we create the political will to phase out coal, oil and gas, and transition to clean energy sources, climate change will usher in a very bleak future.

As typical, the overly hyped exaggeration of weather reporters comes to the forefront. What is often forgotten is that Los Angeles has seen hundreds of hotter days. The "131­
year record" was for the temperature on that date only. The rest of California is seeing beautiful weather of 70-85 degrees, which is less than many years when we have 
experienced 100-degree temperatures in July.

127 million Americans are breathing bad air: Pollen, smog levels a 'double whammy'

About 40% of Americans live in counties where a "double whammy" of unhealthy levels of smog and ragweed pollen -- both tied to climate change -- combine to threaten respiratory health, a Natural Resources Defense Council report said Tuesday. 
"Today, 127 million Americans live where ragweed and ozone can threaten their next breath," said Kim Knowlton, senior scientist at the council, who oversaw the project. "This health threat will just get worse if we don't curb climate change soon." 
Climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, both worsens ozone pollution and extends the ragweed season, the report said. 
The late summer and early autumn season for ragweed pollen is now almost a month longer in many parts of the U.S. than it was 20 years ago, and that trend is likely to continue, the council said. 
Smog forms on warm, sunny days and is made worse from the chemicals that are emitted from vehicle tailpipes and from power plant and industrial smokestacks. It worsens respiratory illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plus, allergies alone can be life-threatening, especially in children, said Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician at Mount Sinai in New York. 
In addition, air pollution from smog and allergens doesn't just damage the lungs, it also affects the brain, heart and skin. "Clean air is so important for human health," Sheffield said. 
Ragweed was selected for this report instead of other pollens, such as tree and grass, because more people are allergic to it than to all the others combined, Knowlton said. Ragweed comes out toward late summer when temperatures and smog levels are the highest. 
The report focuses on 15 of the worst jurisdictions where smog and pollen are especially bad. Those, listed in order starting with the worst: District of Columbia, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Utah, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Massachusetts, Delaware, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Indiana and Kansas. 
"It's ironic and tragic that the nation's key 'hot spot' is Washington, D.C., the very place where wrongheaded policy threatens to make climate and pollution problems worse by the day," said Juanita Constible of the NRDC. Instead of dismantling the Clean Power Plan, the federal government should focus on limiting smog, curbing power plant pollution and increasing vehicle fuel efficiency, she added. 
The group said governments at the state and local levels should also work to ramp up the use of clean energy and diminish smog levels, among other actions.

Trump visits Poland and not everyone is happy about it

Abstract

Full Text 
President Trump arrived in Poland Wednesday and will give a speech Thursday before heading to the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. The trip raised concerns in Europe. Here's 
why. 

Diplomatic coup? 
Poland has one of the most right-wing governments in Europe. The ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) has a broad, anti-liberal agenda that opposition parties, the European 
Union and others allege is endangering the ex-communist country's young democracy. PiS has sought to limit the ability of the courts to operate independently, crack down on 
dissenting media and pursue conservative polices on abortion and gay rights. 

Polish leadership sees Trump's visit as a diplomatic coup because it indicates tacit approval for its policies, and comes before he meets with leaders of staunch U.S. allies Britain, 
France and Germany. 

More heat on climate 
As part of his visit to Warsaw, Trump will meet with President Andrzej Duda and speak at the Three Seas Conference, a forum convened by Poland for Central European, Baltic 
and Western Balkan countries to find ways to boost trade and cooperate on infrastructure projects. 

A key talking point will be how these countries can reduce the region's dependence on Russian energy. Poland already has begun importing more liquefied natural gas from the 

United States, and Trump will almost certainly use his address to boast about the benefits for American business. 
However, he may also use the speech to claim that the U.S. is not alone in its disapproval of the Paris accord to combat global warming. Poland, one of the largest greenhouse-
gas emitters in the region, has found the move from coal to clean energy difficult and clashed with the EU over global-warming mitigation laws. 

Poland, you're OK 

Trump often criticizes NATO members for failing to meet the military alliance's 2% of GDP defense spending goal. But Poland is one of five out of 29 NATO countries that meet 
the alliance's goal. 
White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump will deliver a "major" foreign policy speech in Warsaw's Krasinski Square that will "praise Polish courage" and its 

"emergence as a European power." Make Poland great again Bonikowska of the CIS said the Polish government would make sure that large cheering crowds are on hand for Trump's visit and his speech in Krasinski Square, which will be 
broadcast live on Polish television. She said the country is divided over Trump's presidency, like in the U.S., with some admiring his outspokenness and others viewing him as 
arrogant. 
Mateusz Klinowski, a Polish mayor, said Poland's ruling party is made up of ultra-populists similar to Trump's America First nationalism. "Our government thinks that Poland has 
to rise, to be great again, the same as Trump."

The Trump administration is celebrating a self-designated "Energy Week," which culminates today with a presidential speech and participation in an "American Energy Dominance Panel." But President Trump's proposed budget cuts to energy innovation programs are no reason to celebrate. In fact, they could prove even more damaging to the environment than his decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. 
Not only would innovation programs be cut across the board by $3.1 billion (18%), popular programs such as the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy would be axed entirely. 
Energy Department innovation programs have not been without controversy. Failed loan guarantees for Solyndra and Fisker sparked outrage during President Obama's first term. The Clinton administration and congressional Democrats killed the Experimental Breeder Reactor program, setting back efforts to develop advanced nuclear reactors by decades. And environmentalists and conservatives alike have lampooned costly synthetic fuels and oil shales programs from the 1970s and 1980s that failed to deliver cheap transportation fuels. 
But energy innovations have also brought economic, energy security and environmental benefits. Clean, carbon-free nuclear energy, commercialized by the old Atomic Energy Commission for less than $10 billion in today's dollars, supplies almost 20% of U.S. electricity. Investments in hydraulic fracturing and turbines have allowed natural gas to displace coal as our largest power source, the main reason we have led the world in emissions reductions for a decade. 
Wind and solar energy were commercialized through the Energy Research and Development Administration, which became part of the department in 1977. Technological advances from the Clinton-era Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles paved the way for today's electric cars. The Energy Department and the National Laboratories also played critical roles in developing transformative energy efficiency technologies such as LED lighting, high-definition video screens and high-efficiency appliances. 
Federal investments have worked best when there was private skin already in the game. Competitive grant processes, requiring that private investors share in the cost of developing better technologies, help ensure that promising technologies are vetted for their economic viability by market actors before federal investment starts to flow. 
Warts and all, federal investments in clean energy technology over the past six decades have paid off for consumers, health and energy security. That is why key Republicans have criticized the administration's proposed cuts. Even for those skeptical that climate change is caused by humans and bullish that today's era of cheap fossil energy will continue for decades, these sorts of investments represent cheap insurance to protect our planet.

LETTERS In pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, President Trump is creating damage somewhere between a disaster and a catastrophe. Obviously, refusal to curb its 
greenhouse gases by the world's second biggest carbon polluter (us) will accelerate global warming's impacts, e.g. sea level rise, severe storms, droughts, floods and 
extinctions of endangered species. 
But that's not all. The climate change skeptic is also ceding America's leadership in the world. No more will other countries follow our lead, or even agree to cooperate with us, 

having seen that at any time our president can pull out, rescind or cancel our agreed-upon responsibilities. 

We are losing the competition to lead the next technological revolution, that of sustainable energy production. China now leads in solar, Denmark in wind, Netherlands in tides. 
America leads in turning backward and inward. 
As our planet's temperature increases, we will suffer more destruction from hurricanes, flooding, drought and fires. The productive jobs not created by committing to 

sustainable energy will require jobs to clean up debris, fight fires, build seawalls and bury victims.

Part of President Trump's campaign was a promise to bring back coal jobs, but the majority of Americans already knew he'd have no influence in the coal industry. 
We need to look toward other energy sources. 
Jeff Hartung 
People all around the world look to the United States as a global leader. What today represents is Trump leading us back to the Stone Age. He is absolutely deplorable. 
Climate change skeptics will be the first ones to sue the federal government when their waterfront homes in Florida are under water. Thanks, Trump, for one massive step 

backward. 
Michael Shea 

What people around the world look to the United States for is our money. The common thread to all the programs Trump is canceling is that they are all bad economic deals for the country. He wants other NATO countries to pay their agreed share. What a bad man for thinking that, right? 
Trump is backing out of the Paris agreement, which had us shipping lots of money to those with their hands out. For the first time in quite a while, a U.S. president is actually watching the store. 
Dave Hammond 
Coal is not the future. Renewable and clean energy can be cheaper and better. Let's get on board with the Paris agreement again. Let's keep our country exceptional.

Decades from now -- if sea levels continue rising, polar ice caps keep melting and weather patterns grow ever more extreme -- people might well look back at the spring of 2017 as a key turning point in the failed effort to stave off catastrophic, human-induced climate change. 
President Trump's decision Thursday to withdraw the United States, the world's second largest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, from the Paris climate agreement deals a body blow to one of the best hopes for slowing a ruinous rise in global temperatures. 
By breaking ranks with nearly 200 nations, the United States joins only Syria (which is riven by civil war) and Nicaragua (which thinks the Paris agreement isn't ambitious enough) as the odd countries out. The Trump administration's action abdicates America's moral leadership and makes it easier for other nations to renege on their own pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. 
In making his reckless decision, Trump defied the advice of the world's leading climate scientists. Of Pope Francis and other religious leaders. Of the leaders of the seven wealthiest democracies. Of major corporations, including Chevron, Google, Facebook and Apple. Of members of his own inner circle, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Of his own secretary of State, a former ExxonMobil CEO. 
And Trump ignored the wishes of most Americans, seven out of 10 of whom favor the Paris agreement. 
But the president -- prodded by chief strategist Steve Bannon, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and coal-state Republicans in Congress -- thinks he knows better. At Thursday's Rose Garden announcement, Trump argued that the 2015 agreement "handicaps the United States economy," even though there is no binding deal, only voluntary pledges by each nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
He expressed concern about job-killing restrictions. Yet the Paris accord restricts nothing. Instead, it relies on peer pressure and transparency to limit global warming to a more tolerable level. Trump could have revised President Obama's pledges without ending U.S. participation. 
Trump made a nod toward renegotiating the Paris agreement, or crafting an entirely new pact that would be "fair" to the United States. But it's hard to imagine other nations rushing back to the bargaining table after Trump walked away from an agreement that grew out of decades of arduous climate talks. 
Other governments, notably in the European Union and China, vow to forge ahead developing the clean-energy technologies that will be the drivers of economic growth in the 21st century. But global warming is a problem that requires a global solution. The margin for tilting the planet away from catastrophic climate change in the future is slim, and no matter the slack picked up by other nations in the absence of U.S. leadership, it might not be enough. 
The 45th president dreams of a legacy where America is great again. There was no greatness in the decision he rendered Thursday, just the heightened prospect of a climate-stricken globe left behind for future generations.

Full Text 
President Trump's decision Thursday to exit the Paris climate agreement is likely to give a small and immediate lift to the oil and coal industry, which makes good on a persistent 
campaign promise. 
But, economists and energy experts warn, over time the controversial decision to drop out of the international pact to help stem climate change may hamper the nation's ability 
to financially capitalize on the globe's shift to renewable resources. 

Leaving the Paris agreement jeopardizes the United States' ability to be a global leader in new clean technology developments and sell those insights to a world hungry for 

cheap energy, experts say. 
"The biggest danger in leaving the accord is you lose your seat at the negotiating table for all climate talks to come," says Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which does market 
analysis on next-generation energy solutions. "If you're not able to negotiate bilateral agreements, that can impact U.S. exports of our own leading-edge technology." 

Trump's decision runs counter to the advice of some of his closest advisers, including daughter Ivanka. It also flies in the face of pleas from everyone from Exxon CEO Darren Woods, who wrote Trump asking him to keep the U.S. seat at the bargaining table, to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has made good on his vow to quit the president's economic council if Trump opted out of Paris. 
"Climate change is real," Musk tweeted. "Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world." 
Other business leaders reacting swiftly and negatively to the news, included Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. 
Benioff tweeted that he was "deeply disappointed" by the decision, noting that his company would continue to strive to run only renewable energy. 
Nadella tweeted that "climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action" and linked to Microsoft President Brad Smith's blog post that noted a weeks-long effort to 

lobby, along with other business leaders, the White House to stay in the agreement. 
In making the announcement, Trump seemed to leave the door open for joining a modified global pact under terms he believes are more favorable to the U.S. 
"We are getting out," Trump said at a White House ceremony. "But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great." 
Kann is among those who don't see a big immediate economic effect on the clean-energy movement in the U.S. as a result of the decision. He says that Americans ultimately 

vote with their pocketbooks, which means any clean-energy solutions that can reduce their monthly bills will continue to get support. 
In the short run, withdrawing from the accord will negate the impact of possible carbon emissions fees on gas and electricity costs, economist Gregory Daco of Oxford 

Economics says. And Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, notes the decision will likely slow job losses in fossil fuel industries, such as coal, as well as job gains in 
renewable energy, such as solar and winds. 
But, Zandi adds, employment in coal already has been shrinking in part because natural gas has become a cheaper and cleaner power source. And renewable energy already 

has seen job growth, partly as a result of state mandates and lower prices that have encouraged many home owners to install solar panels on their rooftops, for example. As a 

result, the short-term effect on U.S. employment likely would amount to just several thousand additional jobs, Zandi says. 
"Why would you try to help the coal industry while reducing investment in future energy such as solar, wind and storage? This is crazy," says Mike Phillips, CEO of Sense, maker 
of a high-tech power-measurement device for smart homes. 

Job creation in renewable energy dwarfs coal, which was an obsession with Trump on the campaign trail, Phillips says, citing a Department of Energy report in January that noted the coal industry employs about 160,000 in the U.S. and is shrinking, while jobs are growing in the areas of energy-efficiency (2.2 million), natural gas (400,000), solar (374,000) and wind (102,000). 
Zandi says Trump's decision makes it less likely the U.S. will be at the forefront of clean energy innovation, possibly costing the country as many as hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next decade or two. "We're not going to lead the way," he says. Credit: Marco della Cava, Jon Swartz, Paul Davidson and Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY

Full Text 
President Trump's decision Thursday to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement put the rest of the world on notice about a decision he had already made: to stop 
implementing the Obama-era policies that would have allowed the United States to meet its commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. 
But in making the long-awaited announcement, the president also added a signature Trump condition: that he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement on more favorable 
terms. 

"So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we'll see if we can make a deal that's fair," he said. 

Under the terms of the international accord to reduce greenhouse gases, the earliest a nation can formally withdraw is November 2020 -- the same month Trump faces re­election. But because the greenhouse gas reduction targets are largely voluntary, Trump said, he would immediately "cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord." 
European leaders quickly responded that the accord was "irreversible" and not open to renegotiation. 
"We firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies," said a joint statement by Italian Prime 

Minister Paolo Gentiloni, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. 

In a half-hour speech in the White House Rose Garden, Trump did not address the scientific consensus that rising global temperatures, almost certainly caused by human 
activity since the industrial revolution, are a threat to the planet. He has called that science "an expensive hoax" perpetrated by the Chinese. 
Instead, Trump complained that other countries had attached too many conditions to their commitments -- known as nationally determined contributions -- to reduce carbon 

emissions. As he has with with trade and immigration, Trump accused the rest of the world of taking advantage of the U.S. 
"At what point do they stop laughing at us as a country? I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." 
China, for example, said it would begin reducing emissions beginning in 2030 -- meaning it could continue to build coal-fired power plants every year until then. 
"In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and ships them to foreign countries," Trump said. 
Trump has made clear he views the climate accord as an obstacle to his goal of creating jobs and ensuring energy independence. In March, he signed an executive order rolling 

back most of the environmental regulations the Obama administration had used as a down payment toward its nationally determined contributions. 

Still, the rest of the world was watching to see how far Trump would go in backing out of the deal. The White House said Trump "personally explained" his decision Thursday in a call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Trump cast the decision in terms of his campaign promise to "put America first," reasserting American sovereignty. He made his announcement in the same place where 
President Obama hailed the agreement as "a turning point for our planet." How the USA has gotten warmer Changes over the past 22 years (1991-2012) compared with 1901-1960 average. (Alaska and Hawaii compared with the 1951-1980 average.) Credit: Gregory Korte, @gregorykorte, USA TODAY

Climate change could foul up precipitation: Study warns of redistributed rain around the world

Last month alone, climate change was blamed for sleepless nights and trees moving west. Now there's a new problem: weird rainfall. 
A study in the journal Science Advances suggests climate change will alter where rain falls around the world, making wet areas wetter and dry areas drier, especially in the summer. 
The world's rainiest areas may push north during the winter, said study lead author Aaron Putnam, a glacial geologist at the University of Maine. The redistribution of rainfall is worrisome, he said, as it would affect water availability for people around the world. 
The shift isn't unprecedented: It's happened before, but that was because of natural climate change. 
Researchers studied ancient climate history to see how a warming climate changed rainfall patterns. About 14,600 years ago, a shift in temperature changed where precipitation fell over the entire planet, much like the predicted effect of man-made global warming over the next few decades. 
Global warming occurs when heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, which boosts world temperatures to levels that scientists say cannot be explained by natural factors. 
The study "adds to the large body of evidence that climate change is going to mess with the large-scale motions of air and water in the atmosphere," NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel, who wasn't involved with the study, told Wisconsin's Beloit Daily News. "And this matters, because those patterns largely determine where it's rainy or arid, broadly speaking," 
According to NASA, rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's water cycle, increasing evaporation. This increased evaporation will result in more storms but also contribute to drying over some land areas. 
As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and increased risk of flooding, while areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Jobs creation has been the mantra of President Trump. But in some industries such as tech, the U.S. doesn't need more jobs -- it needs workers with more of the right skills. 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there will be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020. 
The problem: A "perception gap" between educators and employers has left scores of jobs unfilled, according to new research from the Career Advisory Board, which closely 

tracks the jobs market. 
Only 11% of employers believe higher education is "very effective" in readying graduates to meet skills needed in their organizations, according to the January survey of 501 

U.S. hiring managers, human resource specialists and executives. Some 62% said students were unprepared. 
The jobs gap is especially pronounced by age: 72% of respondents agreed that Millennials are keeping pace with technology but only half of Baby Boomers are, the survey said. 
There are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide, but less than 43,000 computer-science students graduated into the workforce last year, according to Code.org, a 

non-profit group dedicated to expanding access to computer science. 
Last year, the White House claimed the federal government alone needed an additional 10,000 IT and cybersecurity professionals. 
Trump has yoked his political success to creating new jobs. Many of the successes he has claimed have involved traditional manufacturing, a once steady and high-paid sector 

that's declined with automation and offshoring. 

This week, he touted the creation of 150 U.S. jobs at Ford Motor (moves in the works before his administration) and signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era climate change regulations in a bid to create more jobs for coal miners. The availability of so many tech jobs -- particularly in coding, the Internet of Things, big data and cybersecurity -- presents an opportunity for Trump to make good on his 
promise to help frustrated workers while pursuing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and major changes to the H-1B visa program, educators and tech leaders say. 
"The jobs are already here," says Rob Paul, president of DeVry University, which conducted research online for Career Advisory Board and offers educational services that includes boot camps for tech skills. "Speed is of the essence in filling them." The emergence of boot camps has slightly eased the problem in getting thousands of Americans up to snuff in skills for coding, Internet of Things, big data, cybersecurity and 
high-tech manufacturing but doesn't go nearly far enough, Paul and others say. 
"When I worked within Silicon Valley, it boggled my mind -- there were so many available jobs," says Randi Zuckerberg, CEO of Zuckerberg Media, which is partnering with 
DeVry and others to "get kids, especially girls, excited" about science, technology and math. Zuckerberg's 6-year-old son took a course in robotics. 
"A lot of progress is being made, but we need to ramp it up," says Zuckerberg, whose brother is Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. 
"Every company now is really a tech company, with needs for social media, supply management and distribution. The jobs will grow exponentially."

Abstract

Full Text 
Will coal jobs suddenly come roaring back? Don't bet on it. Will the price of electricity go into reverse? Not likely. Will increased federal land rights for oil and natural gas clear the way for more U.S. energy production? Yes, eventually. And fewer regulations for oil and natural gas could contribute to lower energy prices in the long run. Plus, lower fuel economy standards, which the Trump administration is contemplating as part of a separate review, could bolster gasoline demand. 
Still, the biggest factors shaping the U.S. energy industry are market forces -- and that's not changing anytime soon. Here's how Trump's executive order could affect Coal jobs Trump has promised to restore the coal industry, but that's a dubious promise for a simple reason: Natural gas is cheaper, cleaner and more readily available. Coal accounted for about half of American electricity a decade ago, but that fell to 29% in 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration. The number of U.S. coal 
mine jobs was 65,971 in 2015, down from 91,611 in 2011. 
Former president Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan in 2015 curbed emissions at power plants, aiming to combat climate change. Trump wants to roll back the plan, which had 
slashed allowable carbon pollution. 
"It may have the impact of avoiding further job losses than it does bringing back plants that are closed," Stewart Glickman, energy analyst at market research firm CFRA 

Research, said in an interview. 

But the substantial increase of available natural gas amid the U.S. shale boom has undermined coal's viability as a fuel source for utilities. Advances in energy extraction 
through new hydraulic fracturing techniques have increased supplies of oil and natural gas, and those gains aren't receding. 
"Natural gas as a competitive threat to coal isn't going away simply because we're gonna lift regulations on coal," Glickman said. "And, ironically, to the degree that the Trump 

administration is able to put in place other changes that lift restrictions on drilling for crude oil and natural gas, all you're doing is making gas that much cheaper for utilities to 

purchase." 
"The decrease in coal by the electricity sector is because of economic reasons, as it has been outcompeted by low-cost natural gas," Greg Gershuny, of the Aspen Institute's 
Energy and Environment Program, said in a report. 

Oil and gas jobs 
The prospect of additional drilling on federal land could be a boon to oil and gas jobs, which have suffered over the last two years as the price of oil fell below $26 per barrel in 

early 2016. The U.S. mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction sector had an estimated 628,800 jobs in February, up from a 10-year low of 608,600 in October but down from a 
high of 851,800 in September 2014. 
But additional drilling remains a small factor in the short term. That's because oil producers want to avoid committing to new leases while crude prices remain low. Few analysts 

expect a major surge in prices in the next few years. Oil is trading around $50 per barrel. 

One big factor is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which reached an agreement in late 2016 to slash oil production in a bid to bolster prices. It worked for 
a few months, but skepticism about the durability of the accord has bubbled up in recent weeks. 
OPEC countries are unlikely to cede market share to the U.S. for long, said Mark Watkins, an investment manager who monitors oil for U.S. Bank's Private Client Group. 
Meanwhile, sluggish economic growth around the world remains perhaps the greatest impediment to the U.S. energy industry. 
"Opening up more leases isn't an immediate benefit because we've got to get more demand," Watkins said. 
Pump prices 

There won't be any immediate impact on gas or heating oil prices, which are determined primarily by market forces. 
U.S. oil and natural gas producers have increased production in recent years, which has contributed to gasoline's slide. Gas prices have fallen from nearly $3.90 per gallon nationwide in September 2012 to about $2.29 on Tuesday, according to GasBuddy. 
Gasoline is unlikely to make a sudden surge because U.S. oil production is picking up. U.S. producers have added 336 oil rigs since the industry's low point May 27, according to Goldman Sachs. 
Wind and Solar 
Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which have long been more expensive than fossil fuels, have gained considerable ground in recent years, according to a recent report by investment firm Lazard. 
That makes solar panels, for example, a viable option for certain consumers. The average system costs $15,000 to $21,000 but often pays off in energy savings after five to 10 years, Consumer Reports says. 
Gershuny said the rise of renewables will hasten coal's demise: "This policy won't work. It is a mistake for the Trump administration to think it can reverse the demise of coal. Even the coal industry knows this." 
A report released Tuesday by the Solar Foundation concluded that jobs connected to solar energy increased 25% to 260,077 in 2016. 
"While (Tuesday's) order is not a step in the right direction, it will not halt the solar industry's progress," Solar Foundation President Andrea Luecke said in an email.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
President Trump's executive order on American energy independence is a sweeping repudiation of Obama-era environmental initiatives, substituting a strategy of combating 
climate change through international cooperation for an America-first energy policy. 
Trump proclaimed the order as "the start of a new era of American energy production" that would "restore economic freedom and allow our workers to thrive, compete and 
succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time." 

Trump spoke at a signing ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday on a stage with a dozen coal miners. 

Trump's order attempts to roll back Obama-era policies on power plant emission limits, coal mining on federal lands, fracking and methane. Because most of those rules were 
finalized under Obama, the Trump administration would have to start from the beginning on a rulemaking process to dismantle those regulations. 
Trump's order takes aim at the entire framework of climate change action under the previous administration. 
Under Obama, federal agencies were required to plan for and mitigate the future effects of climate change, treat it as a national security issue and attempt to reduce their own 

greenhouse gas emissions by 40%. All of those policies are rescinded by Trump's order. 
Environmental activists deplored the order. 
Annie Leonard of Greenpeace USA said it showed Trump is "just a fossil fuel industry stooge with a presidential pen." 
She cast the executive order as a temporary setback. 
"Thankfully, for all his bluster, the best Trump can do is delay America's inevitable transition to clean energy, but he can't stop it," she said. 
The White House said Trump's action will provide the framework for a new emphasis on more energy production and more jobs. 
Despite relaxing environmental standards, the White House argued that its energy policies could be good for the environment in the long term. 
"The president strongly believes that protecting the environment and promoting our economy are not mutually exclusive goals," spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday. "This 

executive order will help to ensure that we have clean air and clean water without sacrificing economic growth and job creation." 
The order will ask all federal agencies to identify obstacles to domestic energy production, then report back to the White House for future action. 
Trump said the order is "returning power to the states, where that power belongs." 
The order makes good on Trump's promise to end what he called a "war on coal" and to bring back industry jobs. "I made them this promise. We will put our miners back to 

work," Trump said Tuesday. 

"The war on coal is over," Vice President Pence said at the executive order signing ceremony Tuesday, flanked by Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke 

and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. 

Former vice president Al Gore called the order "a misguided step away from a sustainable, carbon-free future for ourselves and generations to come." 

"No one man or group can stop the encouraging and escalating momentum we are experiencing in the fight to protect our planet," Gore said.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
An executive order President Trump signed Tuesday won't just repeal his predecessor's regulations on power plants. It's a sweeping demolition of Obama-era policies on coal mining, fracking, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. 
Trump's executive order takes aim at a wide range of Obama policy tools, including executive orders, presidential memoranda, regulations and policy guidance. Some of those Trump can eliminate with the stroke of a pen. Many would require a new regulatory process, which could be subject to new lawsuits and controversies. 
One senior administration official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity Monday because the order had not yet been finalized, identified at least 10 specific Obama policies that Trump would attempt to undo. They include: 
1.
 A 2016 Obama memorandum identifying climate change as a national security issue, and directing the Pentagon and other agencies to "ensure that climate change-related impacts are fully considered in the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans." 

2.
 A 2015 Obama executive order requiring agencies to take steps to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, with a goal of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases produced by the federal government. 

3.
 A 2013 Obama executive order directing federal agencies to prepare for and mitigate the effects of climate change, including "an increase in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, more heavy downpours, an increase in wildfires, more severe droughts, permafrost thawing, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise." 

4.
 The Clean Power Plan, an ambitious rule that attempted to set a national limit on carbon emissions from existing power plants. That rule has already been temporarily held up by the Supreme Court. If not already struck down by the courts, the Environmental Protection Agency would have to go through a new rulemaking process to seek comments on any new rule dismantling the Obama policy. 

5.
 The new plant rule, another component of the Clean Power Plan that addresses new power plants. It, too, would be subject to a new rulemaking process. 

6.
 The consideration of the social cost of greenhouse gases and climate change in conducting environmental impact assessments, expanding the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. That policy change came in a guidance document from the White House Council on Environmental Quality last August, and can be immediately rescinded. 

7.
 The moratorium on coal mining on federal and tribal lands. This change doesn't require a new regulation and can be implemented immediately. 

8.
 A 2016 regulation from the EPA limiting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Like all final regulations, the Trump administration would have to start the regulatory process from the beginning in order to rescind the rule. 

9.
 A similar rule from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) limiting "venting, flaring and leaking" on oil and gas wells on federal lands, which would also be reviewed for possible repeal. 

10.
 The BLM's hydraulic fracturing rule, which tightened standards on gas well construction, governed the disposal of fracking waste and required disclosure on the fracking chemicals used. That rule has also been held up in court, but would require a new rulemaking process to formally take off the books. Credit: Gregory Korte, @gregorykorte, USA TODAY

According to news reports, Trump plans to lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing; dump regulations on oil industry methane pollution, a strong, if relatively short-lived greenhouse pollutant; and slash Environmental Protection Agency staffing and funding.

Full Text 
Seemingly every month provides alarming new evidence of human-caused climate disruption. Last month was the hottest February on record globally, shattering the previous record, according to analyses by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Nearly all climate scientists agree that the key ingredient for rising temperatures -- on land and in the oceans -- is the accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
That's why the best hope of heading off catastrophic climate change lies in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the whole basis for the 2015 Paris Agreement signed by 197 nations. 
And it's why the United States, as the world's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, pumping 6 billion tons into the air each year, took steps under President Obama to reduce carbon pollution through the next decade by 26% from 2005 levels. 
Now, less than two months into his presidency, Donald Trump is acting to reverse America's progress on climate change. 
On Wednesday, the president told an audience at a former industrial plant near Detroit that he'd roll back tough standards aimed at nearly doubling the fuel economy average for cars and trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Those regulations, developed in 2012, have proved in their first phase to be a good way to jump-start efficiency. 
A second phase of even tougher standards, for 2022-25 car and truck models, might be a bridge too far. Those standards could unfairly drive up vehicle costs and hamstring automakers with vehicles people won't buy, at least not until gas prices rise again. A better alternative would be a carbon tax rebated to consumers, an idea recently pushed by a slate of Republican elder statesmen. 
But Trump doesn't seem interested in alternative ways for saving the planet, only in demolishing Obama's climate legacy. Next on the new president's to-do list is rewriting rules mandating cleaner-operating power plants, which, along with autos, create about 60% of U.S. greenhouse-gas pollution. Meanwhile, White House advisers are debating whether the U.S. should pull out of the Paris Agreement altogether, a step that would undermine other nations' voluntary efforts to curb carbon pollution. 
There's more. According to news reports, Trump plans to lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing; dump regulations on oil industry methane pollution, a strong, if relatively short-lived greenhouse pollutant; and slash Environmental Protection Agency staffing and funding. He has been stocking his administration with climate change skeptics. 
If there's any good news for the planet, it's that Trump is president and not emperor, so the public, legislators, states and environmental groups have plenty of ways to push back against his anti-environmental agenda. Redrafting the fuel economy standards and Obama's Clean Power Plan would require a lengthy regulatory process followed almost certainly by legal challenges. 
Shortly after Trump was elected, the president told The New York Times reporters and editors he had an "open mind" about climate change and the role of burning fossil fuels. His actions since then, however, suggest otherwise.

Maybe it was just a coincidence, but the high temperature in Washington hit a record-shattering 74 degrees on Wednesday, the day a bevy of Republican elder statesmen pitched White House officials on an appealing plan to combat global warming. 
The plan for a refundable national carbon tax -- endorsed by James Baker, Henry Paulson, George Shultz and other GOP luminaries -- represents a long overdue, market-based contribution from the right on the climate change issue. 
This page has long endorsed the idea of putting a price on carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere. Taxing fossil fuels where they enter the economy -- at the refinery, the mining operation or the port -- provides a powerful economic incentive to reduce carbon emissions. A tax is simpler and less intrusive than the Obama administration's heavily regulatory Clean Power Plan, which targets electricity-generating plants. 
The tax would boost the chances of clean energy sources becoming more competitive with oil, coal and natural gas. As long as the carbon polluters can use the atmosphere as a free waste dump, renewable sources such as solar and wind will struggle to be economically viable. 
Depending on how the tax is structured, it could produce rebates going directly to American consumers to offset higher energy costs. The plan promoted by former secretary of State Baker and his colleagues estimates that an initial tax of $40 on a ton of carbon would generate $2,000 the first year for a family of four. 
And there's built-in bipartisan support for the carbon tax idea, which originated with the environmental left. Al Gore likes it, as does Rex Tillerson, Trump's new secretary of State and a former CEO of ExxonMobil. "A carbon dividends program provides a rare exception: a simple idea that strengthens the economy and elevates the economic prospects of the nation's disaffected," the Baker plan says. "Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore." 
There would, of course, be devilish details to hammer out. Imports from countries that don't have a carbon tax would have to be taxed; U.S. exports to those nations would have to get a rebate. Environmentalists would want some or all of the revenue generated by the tax to be invested in clean technology research. Republicans say the tax would make environmental lawsuits and tougher regulations against carbon emitters unnecessary, a stance many Democrats would oppose. 
The biggest problem is political: getting support from tax-averse Republicans in Congress and a new administration stocked with climate change skeptics. But with evidence mounting by the day of the harmful effects of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere, the Baker plan represents a significant Republican-led effort to address climate change, one that's more than a lot of hot air.

On Friday, Elon Musk will complete a journey almost as improbable as his vaunted quest for Mars. 
In attending President Trump's first business advisory council meeting, the South African-born, self-made billionaire who is bent on saving the world from global warming will have become a counselor to a New York real estate mogul-turned-president who is eager to bring back the age of coal. 
The move has many Musk-watchers scratching their heads, given he had not supported candidate Trump. 
"Elon has always been very opportunistic," says Ashlee Vance, whose Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future chronicles the entrepreneur's driven path from Africa to Canada to the U.S. "But still, this is weird." 
The opportunities are many, as are the risks. 
As chief executive officer of companies that compete in the heavily regulated arenas of aerospace (SpaceX), automotive (Tesla) and energy (SolarCity), Musk, 45, can try to parlay his Trump connection into smoothing regulatory bumps and accessing federal funding as he expands his ventures. 
In particular, Musk would appear to be on the brink of bringing sleek electric cars to the masses with his entry-level Model 3 sedan, whose success is key to Tesla becoming profitable and justifying the steep run in its shares. He's hoping to start an alt-energy revolution with a SolarCity acquisition that could find him peddling affordable solar panels and electricity storage devices, an ambition that would benefit from policies such as a carbon tax that penalizes fossil-fuel generation. 
Another possible benefit of Musk having ties to the administration would be ground-floor access at the start of any new lunar mission. 
Trump, in turn, gets to associate himself with an industry maverick -- a disruptor like the political outsider the president has styled himself -- who is opening factories and expanding U.S.-based jobs. Musk's SolarCity and Tesla efforts are slated to employ tens of thousands in factories on both coasts. 
But plenty of pitfalls exist for Musk as he tries to navigate these political waters. 
While Trump may personally find himself drawn to a CEO who likes to speak and tweet in declarative statements -- Musk once blasted Apple as a "graveyard" for failed Tesla engineers -- the president is surrounded by powerful counselors who may have the final word. 
Last week's seven-nation majority-Muslim immigration ban, which prompted protests nationwide, was the work of advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, according to Newsweek. That suggests they or others could steer Trump clear of pro-Tesla or SpaceX decisions should they determine them to be not in the best interests of Trump's base. 
Musk may appeal to Trump's professed love of American ingenuity, but Tesla and SolarCity have an elitist sheen that could spell disaster. Trump appears to be clearing the way for less regulation in the oil and gas industries, which wouldn't be a boon to an electricity enthusiast. 
What's more, if anything happened to today's federal tax incentives on electric cars, Musk could find that his wares cost $7,500 more overnight, no small matter on the $35,000 Model 3. 
And another potential pothole looms for Musk, one that's already dinged another tech company in talks with the White House. 
In agreeing to broadly advise the new administration -- Musk is on Friday's Strategy and Policy Forum council along with CEOs from Pepsi, General Motors and JP MorganChase, and he's part of a group focused on manufacturing -- there exists the potential brand blowback that Uber experienced this week. 
When New York taxis last weekend stopped operating to support protesters at JFK over Trump's Muslim immigration ban, Uber continued to operate. That stand created a backlash on social media named #deleteUber, and competitor Lyft saw its app overtake Uber on the Apple App Store. 
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick also came under fire from drivers, who urged him to quit his position on Trump's advisory council. On Thursday afternoon, Kalanick did just that. 
Although Tesla stock is up nearly 40% since December, the company did start to see some consumers canceling their $1,000 deposits for the company's upcoming entry-level Model 3 sedan, according to auto site Electrek. 
"Kills me as a TSLA fan but need to take a stand," tweeted Colin Niloc, who decided to donate his deposit to charity. 
Musk came out against the controversial immigration ban on Twitter in relatively muted language and suggested his 7 million followers use him as a vehicle for change. "Please read immigration order. Lmk (let me know) specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President," he tweeted. 
That didn't mollify some tech leaders. Facebook's head of artificial intelligence tweeted at Musk in blunt terms: "You are an advisor to Trump. Quit. If you stay, fight and know that this will hurt your legacy regardless." 
In a recent Twitter exchange with Gizmodo, Musk suggested that his decision to engage with the new administration was out of a belief that it would yield better results than a battle. 
"The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better," he wrote. "Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication." 
Musk biographer Vance says that despite the liberal nature of Tesla's green energy agenda, the boss ultimately knows that reaching his business goals -- whether ridding the planet of carbon monoxide emissions or colonizing Mars -- is integral to that personal legacy. 
"Elon is always the underdog, which means he's in self-preservation mode with his companies," says Vance, who notes that despite Musk's outsized personality (another similarity to the 45th president), the success of his companies is by no means guaranteed. 
For instance, SolarCity is battling energy companies that are deep-pocketed donors of congressional leaders. In aerospace, SpaceX is fighting the entrenched practice of the 
U.S. awarding aerospace contracts Lockheed Martin and Boeing partnership. 
In his access to Trump and Trump adviser Peter Thiel, who like Musk made a fortune starting PayPal, Musk has a chance to get the new administration on his side. But it's not a given the gambit will win. 
Thiel told The New York Times, "They're both grandmaster-level salespeople and these two very much larger-than-life figures."

Abstract 
Based on research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, NuScale's technology uses 50-megawatt pressurized water reactors that would be assembled in a factory and installed in combinations of as many as 12 modules, depending on the amount of generation capacity needed. [...]the modules come with safety features the company says enable them to shut down on their own in case of an emergency, without the need for external sources of electricity or water. 

Full Text 
The prospect of a U.S. renaissance in nuclear energy has lost its luster in recent years. 
Yes, four reactors are under construction at two sites in Georgia and South Carolina, the first in 30 years. And last year, the Tennessee Valley Authority completed a plant that 
had lain unfinished for three decades. 
Beyond that, no electricity providers in the U.S. plan to build another reactor any time soon. 
Instead, some have closed reactors. Six units have been shut down since 2013 in the face of competition from natural gas, solar power and wind energy. 
Nevertheless, an Oregon-based company is taking a big step toward eventually rekindling the nuclear option in the USA. 
NuScale Power seeks certification from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a design that's relatively small compared with the massive nuclear plants built since the 

1950s and are simpler to operate. 

Based on research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, NuScale's technology uses 50-megawatt pressurized water reactors that would be assembled in a factory and 
installed in combinations of as many as 12 modules, depending on the amount of generation capacity needed. 
Moreover, the modules come with safety features the company says enable them to shut down on their own in case of an emergency, without the need for external sources of 

electricity or water. 

If certified by the NRC, the reactor design would be used in a new power plant in Idaho whose construction would cost much less than the massive new plants in Georgia and 
South Carolina. 
"When you look at these large-scale plants, very few people can put them on their balance sheets," John Hopkins, the chairman and CEO of NuScale, said in an interview. "With 

our plant, if you were to go with the full 12 pack, you're looking nominally at a cost of $3 billion for 600 megawatts of capacity. And the beauty of it is that they're scalable." 

By comparison, the cost of building Georgia Power's two reactors with 2,200 megawatts of capacity will go well beyond that of the NuScale approach -- specifically, $11 billion 
for the two Vogtle reactors. 
Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), a wholesale provider of electricity in Utah, Idaho and five other states, plans to install 12 NuScale units on federal land at 

the Idaho National Laboratory as a replacement for coal-fired power plants within its system. 

UAMPS would apply to the NRC for a construction and operating license if the commission certifies the design, which NuScale formally sought Dec. 31. The target date for 
completing the nuclear plant is 2026. 
Backed by Fluor, its major investor, NuScale has sunk more than $300 million in the project in recent years, and the DOE has contributed $219 million, based on a competitive 

solicitation. 

More government support will be needed to make the undertaking commercially viable, especially given the relatively low price of natural gas and declining costs of solar and 
wind energy, all of which command an increasing share of the electric power market in the U.S. 
"It's going to take about a billion dollars to get through the entire process, and we've already spent $500 million," Hopkins said of getting to manufacturing- and construction-

ready detail in the design. 
As for market share, Hopkins said his company's product would be "pretty competitive" with natural gas spot prices of $5 per million British Thermal Units. 
That's considerably more than the $2.51 average for the Henry Hub price, the leading U.S. benchmark for gas, in 2016, as well as the U.S. Energy Information Administration's 

estimates of $3.55 and $3.73 for the spot price in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 

Gas prices have a history of volatility analysts said could reoccur, even amid the recent boom in U.S. shale gas production. 
Moreover, Hopkins maintained that concerns over climate change will promote new interest in nuclear energy and its carbon-free emissions. 
Hopkins is buoyed by bipartisan support for NuScale in Washington, where the Obama administration, as well as Republican and Democratic lawmakers, supported the company. He said he hopes for similar backing from the Trump administration. 
NuScale faces the task of proving it's design is legitimate and fending off critics' claims the company's assurances on safety and economics are wrong. 
The future of nuclear energy in the U.S. may hang in the balance.

Trump's EPA pick splits on climate: Pruitt says change is no hoax, but he leaves room for debate

Abstract 
Pruitt joined a coalition of state attorneys general to sue the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants that contribute to climate change. 

Full Text 
President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that he does not agree with Trump that climate change is a hoax, but he 
stopped short of saying that human activity is the main culprit or that the United States must reduce its use of fossil fuels. 
Scott Pruitt, who has sued the EPA 14 times as Oklahoma attorney general, said he believes climate change is real, despite comments from Trump over the years -- including 
during his presidential campaign -- that climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese to reduce the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers. 

"I do not believe that climate change is a hoax," Pruitt said in response to questions from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., during his confirmation hearing before the Senate 

Environment and Public Works Committee. 
When pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Pruitt would not say human activity is the primary cause of climate change. Most scientists say the burning of oil, gas and coal to 
generate power is the main factor creating climate change. Oil and natural gas are major industries in Oklahoma. 

"Science tells us the climate is changing and human activity in some matter impacts that change," Pruitt said. "The ability to measure and pursue the degree and the extent of 

that impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue." 
When Sanders asked Pruitt whether he believes the United States must transform its energy system away from fossil fuels to protect future generations from climate change, 
Pruitt said, "I believe the EPA has a very important role in regulating the (carbon) emissions." 

Pruitt said he believes the EPA has a vital role to play in protecting public health and the environment. During the presidential campaign, Trump called the EPA's work "a disgrace." 
"I believe there is a very important role for the Environmental Protection Agency," Pruitt said. 
Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the committee, questioned what kind of environmental steward Pruitt would be when the president-elect has attacked the 
EPA and talked about wanting to get rid of part of the agency. 

Pruitt said the EPA is crucial in enforcing clean air and water laws across state lines. 

Democrats challenged his ties to polluting industries, his skepticism about the man-made causes of climate change and the frequent lawsuits he has filed to block the EPA's 
clean air and water rules. 
Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., questioned whether Pruitt was giving senators vague, pleasant answers on controversial issues to get through his confirmation hearing. 
She said there was a contrast between Pruitt's comments as Oklahoma attorney general criticizing the federal renewable fuel standard and his promise during Wednesday's 

hearing to carry out that mandate. The renewable fuel standard requires gasoline used by cars and other vehicles to contain a certain amount of renewable fuels. 
"Are you that Mr. Pruitt (who criticized the standard) or the Scott Pruitt today who is saying all the right things at his confirmation hearing?" Duckworth asked. 
The agency was created in 1970 by President Richard Nixon to protect human health and the environment. 
Pruitt joined a coalition of state attorneys general to sue the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants 

that contribute to climate change. He sued the agency over regulations to reduce methane emissions -- also linked to climate change -- from the oil and gas industry. 
"Not a single American voted for dirtier air and drinking water, but if Mr. Pruitt takes the helm at the EPA, that's what millions of Americans and thousands of communities will 

face," said Ken Cook, co-founder and president of the Environmental Working Group. "Every senator, regardless of party, should reject this nomination on behalf of their constituents' health." Pruitt's supporters said he will help rein in an agency that has hurt farmers, ranchers and small businesses and the overall U.S. economy with burdensome and costly 
regulations. 
Nearly 40 livestock associations signed a letter to Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Carper urging Pruitt's confirmation.

Power plants try carbon-capture tech: Projects in Texas, Mississippi may offer glimmer of hope to coal industry

Abstract 
[...]the success of Petra Nova demonstrates advances in carbon-capture and sequestration technology that have been supported for years by companies such as NRG. 

Full Text 
The woebegone U.S. coal industry received a rare bit of good news recently as the independent power company NRG Energy announced the completion of a $1billion venture in Texas. 
Called Petra Nova, the project separates more than 90% of the carbon dioxide from 240 megawatts of coal-fired power at a generating plant near Houston. 
Petra Nova first captured carbon dioxide in September and has delivered more than 100,000 tons of the gas to an old oil field 80 miles away, where it is injected to produce 
more crude from the ground. 

Most notably, it's the world's largest post-combustion system for capturing carbon at a power plant. 

"We're excited about the completion of this project," said Mauricio Gutierrez, president and CEO of NRG. "We're very pleased to tell the market and our shareholders that we did 
this on time and on budget." 
NRG Energy is a partner in Petra Nova with Japan-based JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration. The U.S. Department of Energy is providing $190 million to help advance the carbon-

capture technology. 

This comes as Mississippi Power nears completion of a $6.7 billion carbon-capture project at a 582-megawatt power plant that involves enhanced oil recovery but relies on 
different technology. The DOE is contributing $270million to that project. 
At a glance, the two projects appear to offer a glimmer of hope to advocates of U.S. coal, including President-elect Donald Trump, who would like to see a resurgence in the 

mining of American coal and its use in the nation's power plants. In fact, the success of Petra Nova demonstrates advances in carbon-capture and sequestration technology that 

have been supported for years by companies such as NRG. 
Nevertheless, the challenges confronting carbon capture are daunting, especially outside places such as Texas, where owners of worn-out oil wells can use carbon dioxide to 
bump up production. 

Even in Texas, Petra Nova is barely paying off for NRG and JX Nippon, thanks to low oil prices. 

"This project made a whole lot of sense when oil prices were $100 a barrel," Gutierrez said in an interview. "Today, with oil at just around $50 a barrel, the economics of the 
project are somewhat challenging. It's not what we expected initially, but we can cover our costs." 
The oil field where the carbon dioxide is shipped via an 80-mile pipeline is half-owned by NRG and JX Nippon. The rest belongs to Hilcorp Energy, which operates the field. 
NRG and JX Nippon pay for the costs of the carbon-capture project with proceeds from the sale of oil. While oil is at roughly $50, the project breaks even; at higher prices, it 

can make money. 
West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the benchmark for U.S. oil, sold at $52.47 a barrel at midday Friday. 
What the technology needs for widespread success is a mechanism such as a carbon tax that would put a price on carbon and provide a greater incentive to find commercial 

uses of the gas. Outside California and the Northeast, where state and regional regulations effectively price carbon, there is little interest in the USA in taking that approach. The preference for generating electricity is low-cost natural gas, solar and wind energy, not some cleaner version of coal. That said, Gutierrez doesn't rule out broader adoption some day of 
technologies to capture carbon from power plants and find commercial uses for the gas or bury it deep underground. When that happens, projects such as Petra Nova will help guide the way. If nothing else, he said, commitments by U.S. industry to reduce carbon emissions in the face of climate change, regardless of any changes in U.S. environmental policy under 
the Trump administration, suggest such measures will ultimately be necessary to curb emissions from gas power plants as well as coal units. 
NRG Energy, for example, continues to move in that direction. The company's goal is to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and 90% by 2050, compared with 2014 levels. 
"Whether it's coal today or natural gas tomorrow, we need to figure a way to take carbon out of fossil fuels in power generation," Gutierrez said.

Abstract 
[...]the U.S. is now in position to become a significant exporter of crude oil for the first time in decades and of liquefied natural gas for the first time ever. 

Full Text 
For Jack Gerard, the outlook for U.S. energy security has never been brighter, with domestic supplies of oil and natural gas increasing, dependence on foreign supplies declining 
and a new Republican president and Congress keen on promoting fossil fuels. 
"In this new year and at the start of this new Congress, we have an opportunity to change the national conversation when it comes to energy policy," the president of the 
American Petroleum Institute said recently in his annual "State of American Energy" speech in Washington, D.C. 

"We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to find solutions for many of today's most pressing issues, including creating middle-class jobs, tackling income inequality, ensuring sustained affordable energy for consumers and enhancing our national security. And for all of these goals, and others, the 21st American energy renaissance offers a solution." 
The renaissance that Gerard referred to, of course, is a resurgence in U.S. oil and natural gas production resulting from advances in drilling technologies in shale formations 
across the country. The shale boom has re-established the U.S. as a leader in oil and gas development. 
This rise in oil and gas output has also driven down the costs of gasoline and other fuels for consumers as well as the price of natural gas and other feedstocks for the 
petrochemical industry, which is building new manufacturing facilities at a pace not seen in years. 

Moreover, the U.S. is now in position to become a significant exporter of crude oil for the first time in decades and of liquefied natural gas for the first time ever. 

All of this comes, Gerard noted, as the U.S. records some favorable statistics regarding pollution, including data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that show U.S. 
carbon emissions from electricity generation in the first six months of 2016 were at their lowest level in 25 years, even as electricity demand rose. 
For that achievement, much of the thanks goes to natural gas, which in 2016 surpassed coal as the leading fuel for generating electricity. 
With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to take office in a matter of days and the latest GOP-led Congress already in session, Gerard and API appear optimistic Obama 

administration measures aimed at oil and gas production will be reversed. 

Among the targets are bans on drilling in portions of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans as well as rules requiring further reductions in methane emissions from oil and gas 
operations. Of the latter, Gerard said companies are already curbing methane emissions and are incentivized to do more, because gas captured is gas that can be sold. 
All in all, Gerard maintained that recent developments show that increased energy production and consumption aren't necessarily inconsistent with a cleaner environment, 

though his critics would argue that current emission trends are still well short of the changes ultimately necessary to avert a climate disaster. 
From that perspective, we need to rely more and more on carbon-free forms of energy. 
And while Gerard credited industry for investing billions of dollars in clean-air technologies and cleaner-burning fuels, he also acknowledged that companies "don't act in a 

vacuum." 

"The government at the federal, state and local levels, as they should, set the regulatory parameters in which we operate," he said. "For all of the innovation, investment and 
talent within this and other industry, policy clearly matters." 
So, what should that policy be when it comes to climate change, a term that didn't come up in Gerard's prepared remarks? 
The oil and gas leader deferred when asked about the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which the Obama administration and nearly 200 other governments signed in a bid to keep 

global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius, a point at which scientists say catastrophic environmental damage would occur. 
"What they decide to do with the Paris agreement, we'll leave that up to them," Gerard said, apparently referring to the Trump administration and Congress. 
As for avoiding the term "climate change," Gerard suggested that he did so "to take a step forward and get off the simplistic who believes, who denies" that global warming is 

occurring and that humans are largely responsible for it. 
"Let's focus on demonstrated solutions to the challenges," he said. 

Without a doubt, his point of view will find a more receptive audience in Washington now.

Trump's Cabinet of 'disrupters' ready to go: Nominees likely to lead agencies they've battled

Full Text 
Donald Trump's incoming Cabinet may already have a place in history. 
As Congress considers the president-elect's picks, many have a record of outspoken skepticism of -- and in some cases downright hostility to -- the agencies they would oversee that distinguishes them from previous Cabinets, according to presidential transition experts. Some of them echo the Tea Party -- which helped usher in an era of congressional obstruction. In an interview on Fox Business News in 2014, Andrew Puzder, whom Trump picked to head the Department of Labor, stated, "Who says gridlock is bad? I can tell, the less Washington does the better." 
Former Texas governor Rick Perry has advocated shuttering the Department of Energy he's slated to lead. Betsy DeVos, who would head the Education Department, is a leading proponent of voucher programs that divert taxpayer funds from public schools. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has repeatedly sued the Environmental Protection Agency and, in his official biography, describes himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda." 
Ben Carson has criticized Housing and Urban Development rules designed to combat segregation in housing. Puzder has fought labor rules intended to protect workers. 
"It really is unprecedented, not just the degree to which some of these nominees despise the mission of the agencies or departments they're tapped to head, but the sheer number of them," said John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
That applies particularly to those tapped to run agencies dealing with workers and the environment. Next week's Senate hearings will feature nominees' comments against those agencies' missions. 
Take Trump's EPA pick, Pruitt, who has sued the EPA over President Obama's climate policies. An opinion piece from 2012 could draw scrutiny for its false accusation that Obama wanted to kill the oil industry and spike gasoline prices to near $8 a gallon. Pruitt once questioned whether the EPA had engaged in a conspiracy with environmental groups to file friendly lawsuits resulting in stricter regulations. 
Puzder, a fast-food chief executive, has criticized mandatory breaks for workers, and in a keynote address two years ago, he criticized an overtime rule meant to protect workers. 
critical of own agency 
Previous presidents have chosen nominees hostile to the agencies they oversee. Under Ronald Reagan, conservative Bill Bennett was "someone who really wanted to kill" the Department of Education, and Anne Gorsuch at the EPA and Jim Watt at the Interior Department came in with heavy opposition from environmental and conservation interests. 
The vast majority of Republican administration appointees were like George W. Bush's picks of Christine Todd Whitman at the EPA, Dirk Kempthorne at the Interior and Mike Leavitt at Health and Human Services. "These are people who are conservative, absolutely, but not opponents" of the agencies, Hudak said. 
The Trump team embraces the notion that its nominees are a "team of disrupters" vs. the "team of rivals" approach President Obama adopted in tapping Republicans to join his Cabinet. 
"These highly qualified leaders are in lockstep with President-elect Trump's plan to drain the swamp and get Washington working for America again. Each one is committed to the bold change agenda that Americans voted for in November," the Trump transition team said in a statement. 
There could be open warfare between new appointees and the army of civil servants who populate the agencies. 
Many of these workers, whom political scientists call "the permanent government," see their mission as sanctioned by Congress -- and the funding it's appropriated. 
Trump and his nominees are limited by Congress in curtailing the charter of many agencies, raising the prospect of a spike in litigation should agency heads attempt to overhaul or eliminate significant programs. 
"I don't know if it's great for the country, but it's great for lawyers," said Stan Brand, a former general counsel to the U.S. House under Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill, a Democrat. 
Democrats promise a rough ride for a number of nominees -- though Republicans assure they have the votes to win approval for all of them. 
Democrats put up flares over several nominees who failed to complete the screening process by the Office of Government Ethics. 
GOP controls Senate 
It's unlikely Trump's nominees will be voted down. Republicans hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, and they need 50 votes to approve a nominee. They've built public relations teams to help the nominees deal with media inquiries and to provide rapid response. 
Among Trump's picks: 
Pruitt led a lawsuit by 28 states that sued Obama and the federal government over climate-change-related regulations. A decision on the case is pending in federal court. Other lawsuits targeted rules to cut carbon pollution from coal-powered plants. 
According to the Daily Oklahoman, Pruitt questioned in 2012 whether the EPA had been secretly coordinating with national environmental groups to file lawsuits alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The same year, he accused the Obama administration of wanting to "kill the oil industry," and in an opinion piece, he claimed Obama had "publicly stated goals of raising gas prices to near $8" a gallon. According to FactCheck.org, Obama never spoke of hiking gas prices to such levels. 
Puzder has been a consistent critic of National Labor Relations Board rulings, including a California law intended to prevent companies from denying workers overtime pay by classifying them as salaried and opposing minimum wage increases, which he argued would hurt small businesses. 
Carson has been critical of a fair housing rule to desegregate housing. In 2015, he wrote an opinion column slamming "government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality." 
DeVos is a leading advocate for school vouchers, having funded free-market initiatives in Michigan and other states, as well as efforts to limit oversight and regulation of charter schools. In a speech in 2015, she said teaching has become a "self-serving industry," and "we don't fire teachers enough." 
Despite this history, what matters most is the approach the nominees take once in office, said Terry Sullivan, a University of North Carolina presidential historian who wrote a 2003 book on White House transitions. 
President Richard Nixon appointed agency critics, he said. "They 'went native' by learning that the function of their assigned agency actually filled a gap that the economy would not fill and by learning that government agencies were filled with well-educated and highly intelligent staffs," Sullivan said.

Full Text 
U.S. energy producers of all kinds see reasons for optimism as they start 2017, though the incoming Trump administration may spell trouble for some of a greener hue. 
Among oil drillers, a recent uptick in prices suggests an end to a slump that has persisted since mid-2014, while natural gas, solar and wind energy companies aim to build on 
their gains in U.S. electric power markets in 2016. 
Even the struggling nuclear sector can point to victories in New York and Illinois, where unprofitable reactors were saved by state actions last year. 
That said, here's a list of some of the most notable energy developments for the U.S. in 2016 -- ones that may set the stage for how Americans produce and use energy in 

2017. 
The re-emergence of OPEC 
For the first time since 2008, OPEC agreed to cut its oil output in a bid to boost prices and recover some market control. Saudi Arabia and other cartel members were joined by 

Russia and other non-OPEC nations in agreeing to curtail production by nearly 1.8million barrels a day in 2017. It's still too early to say whether the deal will stick, though Brent 
crude, the global oil benchmark, was up by 12% on Friday from Nov.30, when OPEC met. 
Trump promises shakeup 
The president-elect has promised to promote oil, natural gas and coal aggressively, and pull back on Obama administration commitments to fighting climate change. 

Temperatures up 
The year 2016 is likely to be the hottest on record, surpassing record highs set in 2015 and 2014. This comes as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, signed by the U.S. and 
nearly 200 other nations to avoid a catastrophic increase in temperatures, took effect. Still, carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels are likely to rise only slightly globally in 
2016 and fall a bit in the U.S. 

Solar leads additions 

Electric-power companies expect to add more than 26 gigawatts of new utility-scale generating capacity to the grid in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration (EIA). If estimates bear out, 2016 will be the first year in which more solar energy is added to the grid than any other source. 
Offshore wind debuts 
Wind turbines are common off some European coasts, but none spun in U.S. waters until December. That's when a five-turbine wind farm began operating off the shore of 

Rhode Island. 
Bright spots for nuclear 
New York and Illinois passed laws to save unprofitable reactors. With Trump administration backing likely, the industry hopes other states will follow suit. 
Natural gas run-up ends 

U.S. natural gas production is expected to average 77.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, down 1.3 billion cubic feet per day from 2015, EIA reports.

Abstract 
ALASKA WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A DAILY REALITY Alaska was so warm this year, snow was shipped in for the Iditarod sled dog race, ice melt forced polar bears into the paths of schoolchildren, and the state saw its biggest landslide in decades, partly due to retreating glaciers. The powerful impact statement she read in court gave voice to sexual assault victims and forced the nation to have an important conversation about rape culture.

It was quite a year. We said hello to President-elect Donald Trump. We said goodbye to Prince, Muhammad Ali and John Glenn. We saw the power of peaceful protest at Standing Rock. And we saw the power of hate and gun violence, once again, this time at a gay nightclub in Orlando. We listened as an anonymous survivor of a sexual assault by a Stanford swimmer changed the national conversation on rape. We witnessed history as the first Latina was elected to the Senate. 
There was unspeakable loss and times that affirmed our faith in America. As 2016 comes to a close, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state -- the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about. 
Alabama 
UNPARALLELED LOSS IN STATE'S 'LITERARY CAPITAL' 
Harper Lee, among America's most influential authors, died Feb. 19 in her hometown, Monroeville, Ala. To Kill a Mockingbird -- about a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape in the Jim Crow South -- won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize, sold more than 30million copies in English, is taught in schools and has inspired artists from Truman Capote to Taylor Swift. "What that one story did, more powerfully than 100 speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other and then the way we saw ourselves. Through the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity and the importance of striving for justice," President Obama said in awarding Lee a National Medal of the Arts in 2011. Mockingbird was her only novel until 2015's Go Set a Watchman, which, despite tepid reviews, reaffirmed her as a stalwart anti-racist. 
ALASKA 
WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A DAILY REALITY 
Alaska was so warm this year, snow was shipped in for the Iditarod sled dog race, ice melt forced polar bears into the paths of schoolchildren, and the state saw its biggest landslide in decades, partly due to retreating glaciers. Here, climate change is not abstract -- especially in the state's western corner, where people's relationship with nature is a matter of life and death. 
ARIZONA 
SHERIFF ENDS YEAR WITH A BANG -- OR WHIMPER? 
Sheriff Joe Arpaio, aka "America's toughest sheriff," was criminally charged with contempt of court in October. In November, he lost his election, defeated after 24 years in office. Known nationally for immigration crackdowns and racial profiling, advocates for migrants celebrated. "Sheriff Arpaio didn't lose by coincidence; he was taken down by the people he hunted," Carlos Garcia said. Not one to leave quietly, Arpaio renewed his claim Dec. 15 that President Obama's birth certificate was forged (a theory debunked by fact-checkers and ultimately abandoned by Trump). 
Arkansas 
THE DUGGARS ARE STILL COUNTING 
TLC may have pulled the plug in 2015 on its hit series 19 Kids and Counting after the revelation Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's son, Josh, sexually molested five young girls, including his own sisters, but in 2016, the Duggar family still made headlines. This year: Jinger Duggar married soccer player Jeremy Vuolo. Jessa and husband, Ben Seewald, announced they're expecting a second child. So did Jill. And Josh Duggar got out of rehab and returned to Arkansas, months after he'd checked into a "faith-based" facility in Illinois. 
California 
CHANGING DISCOURSE ON SEXUAL ASSAULT 
Her words were raw and excruciating. "You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today," said Emily Doe, the anonymous victim of a sexual assault in 2015 by Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. The powerful impact statement she read in court gave voice to sexual assault victims and forced the nation to have an important conversation about rape culture. Turner, who assaulted Doe near a trash bin while she was unconscious, was sentenced to six months in prison, a seemingly 
lenient punishment that drew national outrage. He served only three months. In the aftermath of the case, California passed a law requiring longer sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims. Doe was named one of Glamour magazine's 2016 Women of the Year. Colorado 
PEYTON MANNING SAYS GOODBYE TO THE NFL Future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning capped an 18-year career by winning Super Bowl 50 in his final NFL game -- propelling the Denver Broncos to a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Like Broncos president and former Denver QB John Elway, Manning retired as a champion. He became the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl and the first to win Super Bowls with multiple franchises. 
Connecticut GUN VIOLENCE AD WITH A TWIST GOES VIRAL Gun violence can be stopped if you know what to look for. That's the message of the ad "Evan," which went viral this year. A folk song sets the tone for a romance that unfolds 
with expert pacing. Then it comes to a shattering halt. The spot is from the Sandy Hook Promise, a non-partisan, non-profit group launched by families who lost loved ones four years ago in Newtown. Delaware 
JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020? POSSIBLY, MAYBE Joe Biden, a former Delaware senator and two-term vice president, said he's not ruling out anything -- including a run for the White House -- as Democrats look to the future after a stinging election. Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2008. In announcing his decision not to run for 2016, a grieving Biden, whose son, Beau, died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015, said the country needed "a moonshot" to cure cancer. President Obama put him in charge of that initiative in January. 
Florida AFTER PULSE SHOOTING, WE MOURN THE VICTIMS Omar Mateen's voice went from emotionless to frenzied, speaking with police negotiators June 12. Referencing U.S. airstrikes in the Middle East, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce killed 
49 and left dozens injured at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, in one of the deadliest shooting rampages in U.S. history. He was killed after a three-hour standoff. After initial plans to turn Pulse into a memorial, owners recently decided to keep the LGBT club. Georgia 
DAD IN 'HOT CAR' CASE GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES Prosecutors said he knew his 22-month-old son sweltered in a hot car for seven hours. The jury agreed. Justin Ross Harris was found guilty in November on all charges in the death of son Cooper in 2014. Prosecutors argued that Harris wanted to live a child-free life. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 32 years. 
Hawaii 75 YEARS AFTER ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR More than seven decades after Japanese forces struck the heart of the Navy's Pacific Fleet in a fiery ambush at Pearl Harbor, thousands of veterans, military officials, dignitaries 
and a dwindling number of survivors gathered there Dec. 7 to remember the dead and the start of a war that changed the world. Pearl Harbor gave birth to the "Greatest 
Generation," said Tom Brokaw. Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe toured the site with President Obama, marking the first formal visit by a Japanese leader.

WHO'S TEACHING THE CHILDREN? 
We trust them with our kids, but what don't we know about teachers' troubled pasts? A USA TODAY Network investigation found flaws in the nation's fractured systems for 
checking teachers' backgrounds. Several teachers have left or been removed from positions after misconduct came to light, including Idaho high school teacher James P. Verity. 
Verity lost his teaching license in Oregon over allegations of a sexually charged relationship with an 18-year-old student but found a fresh start teaching in neighboring Idaho. 
The investigation prompted a state-by-state audit of a privately run database of disciplined teachers. 

Illinois CHICAGO HITS GRIM MILESTONE Gun violence defies comprehension in Chicago. In 2016, the nation's third-largest city surpassed 700 murders. There is no shortage of maladies plaguing Chicago. It is mired in 
billions of dollars of debt, unemployment for young black men hovers just below 50%, and Chicago's African-American population has plummeted by nearly 200,000 since 2000 as the black middle class has looked for greener -- and safer -- pastures. The city blames the violence on a combination of increased gang activity and weak gun laws, but anti-violence activists point to a lack of economic opportunity. Diane Latiker, who heads the Chicago organization Kids Off the Block, said, "Chicago has long been one of a Tale of Two Cities. Nothing has changed." 
Indiana USA GYMNASTICS ENABLED SEX PREDATORS The issue of sexual misconduct by coaches has haunted USA Gymnastics for decades, but an investigation by The Indianapolis Star revealed the organization's policies enabled 
predatory coaches to continue working with children, despite warnings of misconduct. At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics. And it's likely an undercount. Iowa 
GOV. BRANSTAD HEADING TO CHINA He helped deliver Iowa's electoral votes to Donald Trump. Gov. Terry Branstad will serve the new administration as U.S. ambassador to China. Branstad has known Chinese President Xi Jinping since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa on an agricultural mission, and considers him "an old friend." He's conducted numerous trade missions to China to promote 
Iowa agriculture products. Branstad, 70, is the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, serving four terms from 1983 to 1999 and a term and a half since 2011. 
Kansas 
BOY DIES ON WORLD'S TALLEST WATERSLIDE 
It was called Verrckt, the German word for crazy or insane. At 168 feet high, it was taller than Niagara Falls and the Statue of Liberty. Officials announced the ride would be demolished after the death of Caleb Schwab, 10, son of Rep. Scott Schwab. Caleb died from a fatal neck injury suffered on the ride in August at the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City. The ride propelled rafts with two to three riders at speeds of up to 65 mph. 
Kentucky 
GOODBYE TO THE GREATEST, MUHAMMAD ALI 
The world mourned when boxing legend and Louisville native Muhammad Ali died June 3 at age 74. Ali was an Olympic gold medalist and three-time heavyweight champion, but he was so much more. His flair in the ring ("Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!") and genius for trash talking ("I'm so mean, I make medicine sick") won him worldwide celebrity. At the height of his fame, he became a leading civil rights and anti-war voice. His opposition to the Vietnam War in 1967 cost him the belt and led to a three-year ban from boxing. After retiring, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984. Even in illness, Ali was an inspiration, his trembling hands lighting the Olympic torch for the 1996 Atlanta Games. His Louisville funeral was attended by thousands, including former president Bill Clinton, who saluted him as a "universal soldier for humanity." 
Louisiana 
HEY, REMEMBER US? 
While America descended from its Olympics high and focused on the presidential election, Louisianans were fighting for survival. In August, the Southern state experienced flooding so horrific that the Red Cross called it the worst natural disaster since Superstorm Sandy. About 40,000 homes and 13 lives were lost. The lack of national interest in the flood could be because Americans are becoming numb to the onslaught of human suffering. "There is a bit of disaster fatigue," says Susan Moeller, professor of media and international affairs at the University of Maryland. 
Maine 
CANNABIS CHRISTMAS? NOT YET, MAINERS 
Although Maine narrowly voted in favor of legalizing marijuana in November, those opposing the measure aimed to snuff out the flame. If a recount, which could take until January, upholds passage, Maine will follow Massachusetts to become the second Northeastern state to legalize marijuana. The law would allow adults to have up to six mature plants, 12 immature plants and an unlimited number of seedlings without a state license. 
Massachusetts 
DAVID ORTIZ, BOSTON'S GREATEST BALL PLAYER, IS OUT 
He didn't go out the way he wanted: David Ortiz, the 6-foot-3 Red Sox slugger from the Dominican Republic, ended his 20-year career in a sweep to the Cleveland Indians in October. It wasn't long, though, before chants of "Thank you, Papi," began, and Ortiz saluted the city he came to embody. After joining the Red Sox in 2003, Ortiz brought three World Series rings to Boston in nine years, including its first in eight decades. He became the city's voice, delivering a defiant, legendary speech in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. He'll go down as one of the greatest Red Sox players of all time -- perhaps the most important. 
Michigan 
12 MONTHS LATER, FLINT'S WATER REMAINS UNSAFE 
President Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint, Mich., in January, but the city's water still isn't safe to drink without a filter. Lead levels spiked after the city swapped water suppliers in 2014. The state skipped necessary anti-corrosion treatments, letting lead leach from miles of old service pipes into residents' taps. Everyone who drank the city's tap water was exposed, including as many as 8,657 children, Census data showed. The harmful impacts are considered most severe on young brains and nervous systems. In one of its last votes of the year, Congress approved legislation worth more than $120 million to deal with the crisis. 
Minnesota 
GENRE-DEFYING ICON PRINCE IS GONE 
When music legend Prince died in April, it seemed as though the whole world stopped to mourn. The pop icon blended funk and rock with his own fierce individualism, winning seven Grammys, one Oscar and a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His body was found in an elevator at his estate in suburban Minneapolis. The cause: an accidental, self-inflicted overdose of a painkiller. The singer didn't have a will, leaving the fate of his fortune to play out in court. Fans celebrated the sassy prodigy who created Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy and When Doves Cry -- all on a single album. Prince album sales rose 11,500% the week after his death, per Nielsen data. 
Mississippi 
SHOCKING ACT OF RACISM BY STUDENTS 
It was a story one could hardly believe was written in 2016. One or more white students placed a noose around the neck of a black football player at the Stone High School in Wiggins, a small town near Biloxi. The NAACP said the incident happened in October during a break in football practice, and the noose was "yanked backward" while on the student's neck. "This is 2016, not 1916. This is America," said Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Days later, a student was disciplined, according to the school district's lawyer, who could not name the student or the specific punishment, citing privacy rules. 
Missouri 
RAMS FANS FURIOUS AS TEAM LEAVES ST. LOUIS 
After 21 years in St. Louis, Rams fans learned in January their beloved franchise officially would move back to Los Angeles. Builders broke ground on Rams owner Stan Kroenke's $2.6billion Inglewood stadium project in November. It will include an entertainment, retail and office development covering nearly 300 acres near the L.A. airport. "I think this is going to be one of the greatest complexes in the world," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said of the Inglewood plan. The Rams are 4-10 and recently fired coach Jeff Fisher. That seems to be OK with some locals. "Whoever they play, I'm rooting against them," St. Louis-area resident Peter Mueller, 22, said as he watched the L.A. Rams in September. 
Montana 
RYAN ZINKE FOR INTERIOR SECRETARY 
President-elect Donald Trump nominated Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department in December, saying the former Navy SEAL strikes the right balance between protecting the nation's natural resources and overly onerous federal regulations. Trump said, "America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he is going to help keep it that way with smart management of our federal lands." Zinke said he is honored by the nomination, describing himself "as someone who grew up in a logging and rail town and hiking in Glacier National Park." 
Nebraska 
FAMILY VACATION TURNS INTO NIGHTMARE 
The horrific death of Lane Graves, a Nebraska toddler killed after an alligator pulled him into a lagoon at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort in June, tugged on every parent's heartstrings. Matt and Melissa Graves were enjoying vacation when a 7- to 8-foot gator emerged from the man-made lake and grabbed Lane, 2, as he played in about a foot of water. A report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found that the boy did not do anything to provoke the alligator -- in fact, the report highlighted how other park visitors alerted Disney employees about seeing gators in the area. Since the attack, Disney has posted additional warning signs around the park and built fences and other barriers around some waterfront areas. 
Nevada 
WOMAN MAKES HISTORY IN THE SENATE 
Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto became the first woman to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate -- and the first Latina in the chamber's history -- after defeating Republican Rep. Joe Heck in a tight race in November. The contest -- which brought in more than $90million in outside money -- keeps the seat in Democratic hands after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid decided not to seek a sixth term after serving nearly 30 years in the Senate. 
New Hampshire 
HEROIN AND OPIOID ABUSE WREAK HAVOC 
In New Hampshire, the heroin and opiate epidemic is a public health crisis. "I have never seen anything like this," Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said during an appearance this year before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "This is about real people dying." Although opioid and heroin addiction have earned the distinction as the greatest drug threat in the USA, the federal government's effort to counter it has been spotty. "The biggest area where we have fallen short is filling the gap between people who need treatment and those able to get it," said Michael Botticelli, director of the National Drug Control Policy. White House officials are moving quickly to get $500 million flowing into the hardest-hit areas since President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act in December to tackle the public health crisis. 
Maryland 
ZERO CONVICTIONS IN FREDDIE GRAY CASE 
Freddie Gray, 25, died of neck injuries sustained while shackled and handcuffed without a seat belt in the back of a police car in April 2015. After Gray's funeral, protests broke out across the city, and rioting resulted in buildings burned to the ground. After Baltimore's medical examiner determined Gray's death was a homicide, many residents wanted the six indicted officers to pay. Judge Barry Williams acquitted three of the officers, including the van's driver and the highest-ranking officer. On July 27, charges against the three remaining officers accused in the death of Gray were dropped, bringing an end to a tumultuous criminal case with zero convictions. 
New Jersey 
AIDES GO DOWN FOR BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL 
Two former associates of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the fall for a politically motivated bridge shutdown that ensnared motorists in a massive traffic jam three years ago in Fort Lee. A jury found Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, guilty of charges tied to the George W. Bridge closure, which was considered payback after Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, refused to endorse the governor for re-election. During their six-week trial, the associates suggested Christie knew early on about the closure, which left motorists stranded and streets packed for five days. Baroni and Kelly are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 21. 
New York 
TRUMP SETTLES FOR $25 MILLION IN LAWSUIT 
During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump vowed not to settle the class-action lawsuits against Trump University, saying, "I don't want to settle cases when we're right." But on Nov. 18, a little more than a week after winning the election, the president-elect agreed to settle fraud cases involving Trump University for $25 million. The deal does not require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. The cases included a lawsuit by New York state and two class-action suits in California against the university, which promised to reveal Trump's real estate investing "secrets" to those who enrolled. The New York attorney general's fraud lawsuit described the defunct university as a scam that lured aspiring real estate developers, requiring them to shell out up to $35,000. 
New Mexico 
NAVAJO GIRL KIDNAPPED, MURDERED IN DESERT 
Ashlynne Mike, 11, and her brother Ian, 9, were near their home in Lower Fruitland on May 2 when a man lured them into his van. He drove them into the New Mexico desert where he molested Ashlynne and bludgeoned her to death with a tire iron. Ian, who was released, was found walking along Navajo Route 13. Ashlynne's family discovered her body the next morning in the desert. Suspect Tom Begaye Jr., who police said confessed, was charged with first-degree murder, felony murder, kidnapping resulting in death, two counts of aggravated sexual abuse resulting in death and two counts of kidnapping of a minor. 
North Carolina 
'DID YOU SHOOT HIM?' 
In a few frantic seconds, something tragic happened on what might have been an ordinary weekday afternoon in Charlotte. Plainclothes officers intending to serve a warrant Sept. 20 on someone else at an apartment complex spotted a person with a gun, they said. They confronted Keith Lamont Scott as he waited for his son's school bus, family and friends said. Scott's wife, coming from their nearby apartment, captured video footage, in which four shots can be heard. "Did you shoot him?" she demanded of officer Brent Vinson. Police and prosecutors said Vinson was justified in shooting because Scott threatened the officers with a gun, or appeared to. Charlotte grappled with several nights of protests as another fatal police shooting sprang into the national consciousness. 
North Dakota 
STANDSTILL NEAR STANDING ROCK 
Find another way. That's what government engineers said Dec. 4 to builders of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline project. It was a victory for demonstrators who had gathered since spring to protest planned construction of the nearly complete oil pipe under a lake at the edge of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, about 30 miles south of Bismarck. The protest was the longest in recent history, as well as the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern times. Law enforcement officers used tear gas and water cannons on the cold but determined crowds. Many of them lived in a sprawling camp of teepees, mobile homes and cars. Sioux protesters got support from people around the country, including veterans, who came in as reinforcements. But the dispute is not over: Pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners said it doesn't want to reroute the segment and blasted the Obama administration. It's unclear whether things could change under the incoming Trump administration. 
Ohio 
GOODBYE, JOHN GLENN 
John Glenn left Earth for a third and final time Dec. 8, when the Ohio-born, space-race hero died at 95. Glenn was a decorated fighter pilot who flew scores of missions in World War II and the Korean War. As a test pilot, he set a transcontinental speed record. He was a CEO of Royal Crown Cola. He served four terms in the U.S. Senate, taking a spin as a presidential candidate in 1984. Not to mention the Cambridge-born, New Concord-raised nice guy was the first American to orbit the planet, circling that big blue ball three times before his risky, dramatic re-entry in the Friendship 7 spacecraft Feb. 20, 1962. In 1998, he orbited Earth again in the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person ever in space, at 77. As a fellow, pioneering Mercury astronaut radioed on the Friendship mission in 1962, "Godspeed, John Glenn." 
Oklahoma 
ONE OF THE MOST SEISMIC PLACES 
Oklahoma opened 2016 with a swarm of 70 small earthquakes in one week after jumping from two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or higher in 2008 to 890 in 2015. In March, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report citing the oil and gas drilling process as the cause. The USGS blamed wastewater disposal, in which high-pressure water is injected into rock formations underground. Oil and gas companies argued that the vast majority of wells cause no problems. Despite depending on the industry for jobs and taxes, Oklahoma strengthened regulations, and the rate of quakes has declined. Lawsuits against several petroleum companies are pending over damage caused by the earthquakes. 
Oregon 
A TENSE, DEADLY STANDOFF 
On Jan. 2, a group of armed anti-government activists led by rancher Ammon Bundy, below, rang in the new year by seizing a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. They said tough restrictions on grazing and other uses of federal land threaten their way of life. The ensuing standoff with authorities lasted more than a month. When Bundy and several others tried to leave the compound to attend a community meeting, law enforcement officials moved in. During the arrest, Robert "Lavoy" Finicum, the group's de facto spokesman, was fatally shot. Bundy, his brother and five other leaders of the occupation were acquitted of conspiracy and weapons charges. 
Pennsylvania 
A TRIO OF HIGH-PROFILE SEX ABUSE CASES 
1.
 A grand jury began investigating six Catholic dioceses after more than 50 priests or religious leaders were found to have abused children over a 40-year period in the Altoona-Johnstown Dioceses and two bishops helped cover it up. In August, the Diocese of Harrisburg acknowledged that 15 priests who had served the diocese had been accused of sexually abusing children. 

2.
 Penn State University is still dealing with the aftermath of Jerry Sandusky's trial, nearly five years after his indictment. The university was told it would be fined nearly $2.4 million by the U.S. Department of Education in connection with the former assistant football coach's conviction for the sexual abuse of 10 minors. 

3.
 Comedian Bill Cosby was charged with drugging and raping a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. The case has been bogged down by pretrial motions for most of the year, but Cosby's trial is scheduled to begin in 2017. 


Rhode Island 
DON'T COME AFTER WOMEN'S YOGA PANTS 
Hundreds of women, girls and other supporters proudly donned yoga pants in October as they peacefully paraded around the Rhode Island neighborhood of a man who derided the attire as tacky and ridiculous in a letter to the editor published in the Barrington Times. "They do nothing to compliment a women over 20 years old," Alan Sorrentino wrote. "In fact, the look is bad. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop wearing them in public." The letter backfired. Women from as far as Texas and Australia said they'd wear yoga pants in a show of solidarity. Parade organizer Jamie Burke said women are "fed up with the policing of our wardrobes and our bodies." 
South Carolina 
DYLANN ROOF IS GUILTY 
Dylann Roof, a self-admitted white supremacist, was convicted in December of the deaths of nine African-American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. After six days of testimony, a federal jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of all 33 counts lodged against him. Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the attack in June 2015, called the verdict "music to my ears." Roof, 22, will represent himself at sentencing, a move that strips his defense team of its decision-making powers. In January, the panel will deliberate on whether Roof faces a life sentence or the death penalty. 
South Dakota 
CONTROVERSY OVER URINE SAMPLE 
People in South Dakota who refuse to cooperate with police for a urine sample may be forced to endure involuntary use of catheters. Though the practice isn't new, it has been criticized as invasive and a constitutional violation. Courtney Bowie, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said the practice raises legal concerns. A man charged with felony drug ingestion asked a judge to throw out evidence in his case. He claimed his rights were violated because he was subjected to an involuntary catheter, after police suspected drug use. Involuntary urine samples are permitted in South Dakota with a signed court order but have been challenged in Indiana and Utah. 
Tennessee 
A DEADLY STORM OF WIND AND FLAME Tennessee was a tinderbox. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the resort town of Gatlinburg, Tenn., reopened to the public this month after devastating wildfires 
caused 14 deaths and damaged about 2,500 buildings. Prosecutors charged two teens with the blazes. The Sevier County fires came near the end of a disastrous year for fires in Tennessee, where 1,427 blazes have spanned 44,027 acres. The state and larger Southeast region are experiencing severe and at times exceptional drought. Texas JUSTICE SCALIA DIES, LEAVING COURT VACUUM 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the loquacious leader of the Supreme Court's conservative bloc and a leading force in American life for three decades, was found dead at a Texas ranch in February, kicking off a fierce battle over the future of the high court. After Scalia died, Senate Republicans refused to consider President Obama's nomination of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland as a replacement, and the remaining justices deadlocked 4-4 in four cases. The court began hearing cases again in October but is stuck in a holding pattern until a new justice (picked by President-elect Donald Trump) can be confirmed and seated. 
Utah 
INDEPENDENT SHAKES UP PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Most Americans might not know his name, but Evan McMullin was the independent candidate for president some said could beat Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. He didn't. McMullin's unlikely surge in the state was a closely watched story line. The former CIA officer is Mormon and had taken on more traditional GOP stances than the party's standard-bearer. Had he locked down Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state. 
Vermont 
GROUND ZERO FOR FEELING THE BERN 
Bernie Sanders, the surprisingly strong challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, won nearly two dozen states in the primaries before endorsing Hillary Clinton. Credit the Vermont senator's winning personality. You tell us: Is the following exchange a real one he had with USA TODAY's Susan Page or a Saturday Night Live skit? 
Q:
 Is it conceivable you would run for president again? Sanders: You know, it's conceivable that I may fly to the moon. 

Q:
 With all respect, it's not conceivable that you may fly to the moon. 


Sanders: If Elon Musk (founder of SpaceX) called me, I could go to Mars. See, you're wrong. I'm going to make Mars a progressive planet. I'll be there first, planting the flag. 
People don't think big enough! [Note: It's not SNL.] 
Virginia 
CHICKEN ABUSE VIDEO LEADS TO FIRINGS 
Animal rights group Compassion Over Killing captured video from inside several Tyson Foods facilities in Virginia of workers stomping, kicking and suffocating breeder chickens. 

In one of the videos, released in August, a worker warned the undercover investigator that "you can't let nobody see you do that" as he stepped on a chicken's head, suffocating it. "You don't know if he's working for the animal rights," he said. Workers seen in the videos were fired, and all live-poultry workers were retrained on the company's animal welfare policies, according to Tyson. 
Washington AMAZON TAKES 'GRAB AND GO' TO A NEW LEVEL Amazon -- the company that made leaving your house to shop optional -- has made leaving your wallet at home optional, too. At least at its brick-and-mortar store in Seattle, 
which has neither cashiers nor self-checkout lines. How it works: Shoppers tap their phone at a sensor by the store's entrance and are identified by a camera. As they browse, cameras, microphones and sensors capture the action. When shoppers leave, items get charged to their Amazon account. If you don't live in Seattle, sorry. There are no plans to open more locations. 
West Virginia NEW CRISIS SURFACES: POISON IN THE WATER The water crisis in Flint, Mich., renewed focus on the nation's water quality. West Virginia's orphaned water systems perhaps best illustrate areas for improvement in water 
testing and cleanliness. A USA TODAY Network investigation found that more than a dozen of the state's utilities didn't have owners or operators. Enforcement efforts for those utilities amounted to little more than a continuous stream of warning letters as utilities failed to test year after year. All the while, residents continued drinking untested -- and potentially contaminated -- water. In Coal Mountain, W.Va., residents boil their water and bleach their own supply. 
Washington, D.C. 
PREPARING FOR TRUMP NATION 

D.C. isn't a state, but one could argue the District's story is the most important of the year. Donald Trump, sweeping to victory as the 45th president of the United States in a bitterly fought campaign that defied the polls, pledged to "be a president for all Americans." A sharply divided nation can't agree on whether a Trump White House will save or destroy us, but it can agree on this: The federal government is wasteful and is led by officials who would say and do almost anything to get elected before abandoning their constituents for powerful special interests. Whoa. 
Wisconsin 
JERIKA BOLEN'S MORTAL DECISION 
Jerika Bolen's final months on Earth, and her heartbreaking decision to leave it, made the nation fall in love with the 14-year-old girl from Appleton. Bolen was thrust into the public eye when she announced she'd give up her fight with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2, a painful and incurable disease. Bolen's story inspired people nationwide to help grant her dying wish by hosting a prom in her honor. Her decision wasn't without controversy. It reanimated a debate over right-to-die issues. Disability rights groups asked authorities to investigate Jerika's care, and those with her condition urged her to change her mind. But Bolen followed through on her decision and died at a Wisconsin hospice in September. 
Wyoming 
YELLOWSTONE'S PERILOUS YEAR 
Wyoming's treasured Yellowstone National Park, which surpassed 4 million visits last year, saw tragic deaths in 2016. In June, a 23-year-old Oregon man plunged into a boiling, acidic spring. Yellowstone officials said Colin Nathaniel Scott was trying to test the water so he and his sister could "hot pot," the act of soaking in the park's thermal pools. In August, a park concession worker fell off a cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River. Park officials said Estefania Liset Mosquera Alcivar, 21, of Ecuador, was chatting with a friend when she went over the canyon's edge.

Smog and pollution blanketed cities across northern China Monday, renewing debate over U.S. role in resolving global environmental issues. 
To me this smog problem in China proves that President-elect Donald Trump is correct. Why should Americans contribute more of our hard-earned tax dollars to China or India? 
They need to clean up their own air. 
John James 
We still contribute more carbon dioxide emissions per capita than China. Coal is on its way out. Innovation in clean energy can provide jobs, profits and clean air. It is a win-win. 

America must lead or fall behind and lose to innovators elsewhere. 
Scott Hardy 
Welcome to Donald Trump's America, where the Environmental Protection Agency is not needed and global warming is a hoax. 
David Apkarian 
The issue of pollution in China is why it is good that in the USA we pay attention to our environment. Not one U.S. city is listed in the top 1,000 of the world's worst polluters, 

according to the World Health Organization. 
It is worth the money that this country spends to be green.

TWITTER 
We asked our followers what role U.S. should play in the global climate fight. 
Let's start with our new administration acknowledging there is a problem. 
@LindsayAlderman 
The U.S. should play no role. 
@acarroll_1114 
Our incoming president and his Cabinet will sadly do nothing about climate change or environmental issues. So, moot point. 
@BuellaMarie 
Heavy export fees for anything being shipped to America from China. Until the pollution is under control.

LETTERS 
I find President-elect Donald Trump's decision to nominate the leader of one of the world's largest and most environmentally disastrous oil companies to serve as secretary of 

State unacceptable. ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson's nomination is a direct threat to the clean air, clean water and response to climate change necessary for the health of 

Americans. 

ExxonMobil not only deliberately concealed its knowledge of climate change for decades, but is also responsible for one of the costliest environmental disasters in history. We 
need foreign policy leaders who will address the climate change threat.

During the campaign, Donald Trump described human-caused climate change as a scam and a hoax, and he vowed to take the United States out of the Paris accord, a global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the warming they cause. 
Since the election, the president-elect has changed his tune, telling Fox News Sunday that he is "open-minded" about the Paris agreement, and that he had "good meetings" recently with climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Those are encouraging words for the two-thirds of Americans rightfully worried about global warming. But there seems to be a disconnect between those words and Trump's actions in putting forth a slate of climate change skeptics for key administration jobs: 
Most troubling among them is Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general and fossil fuel industry ally, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA -­unsuccessfully more often than not -- to block federal efforts to limit the poisons flowing from power plants, reduce smog, protect waterways, and cut climate-harmful methane. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune compares putting Pruitt at the EPA to "putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires." 
Trump's architect for EPA transition is Myron Ebell, director of a Washington think tank funded by coal and oil interests and a noted global warming skeptic. Ebell has accused scientists of "manipulating and falsifying the data" on climate change. 
The president-elect's consideration for Interior secretary is Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. A strong opponent of greenhouse gas regulations, she once said that Gore "deserves an 'F' in science and an 'A' in creative writing." If approved as Interior secretary, Rodgers would oversee energy policy on a half-a-billion acres of public land. 
The leading contender for secretary of State is Rex Tillerson, chief executive of energy giant ExxonMobil. Tillerson, to his credit, acknowledges that climate change is a threat and supports a carbon tax. But given his background, it's hard to imagine Tillerson promoting a transition away from fossil fuels. 
Thomas Pyle, a former Koch Industries lobbyist who is handling the transition at the Energy Department, authored a wish list for rolling back Obama administration climate initiatives: pulling out of the Paris accord; increasing energy production on federal lands; canceling President Obama's Clean Power Plan; and scaling back vehicle emission standards. 
U.S. leadership on climate issues is vital because America is second only to China in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. More than 190 countries signed the Paris accord, and if Trump pulls the U.S. out, other nations discouraged by America's action might leave as well, vastly increasing the odds of highly dangerous warming with rising seas, growing drought and severe weather. 
On climate change issues, it's important to watch not just what Trump says, but also what he and his appointees do. Nothing less than the future of the planet could depend on it.

Abstract 
[...]the president-elect selected as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt -- a skeptic of climate change who repeatedly has sued the EPA to push back regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. 

Full Text 
Donald Trump ran for the White House as an outsider and a pragmatist. But he's quickly putting together an administration that will be the most fiercely conservative of any in decades. 
After campaigning as the least ideological presidential contender in modern times, Trump is naming a Cabinet and senior White House staff that is dominated by retired military leaders, wealthy business executives and partisan activists who oppose the historic mission of the departments they are poised to head. While the president-elect issued few policy blueprints while he was seeking the job, his nominees for key posts already have been leading the charge to dismantle President Obama's initiatives on health care and climate change. 
"I call it the three 'G' Cabinet: Goldman, generals and gazillionaires," Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, said mockingly Sunday on ABC's This Week, a reference to multiple Trump appointees who have worked at the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs. 
On Fox News Sunday, Trump said he was "very, very close" to naming his pick for the Cabinet's biggest prize, secretary of State, speaking favorably of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. "He's much more than a business executive," Trump said of Tillerson, reported to be the frontrunner for the job. "I mean, he's a world-class player." The president-elect also favorably mentioned two other prospects, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker. 
Trump's unorthodox campaign, dominated by a promise to "make America great again" and attacks on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, gave limited insights about what a Trump administration would look like. But in the past four weeks, he has reassured Republicans and alarmed Democrats by appointments that largely reflect GOP orthodoxy -­from a Labor secretary-designate who opposes raising the minimum wage to a Housing and Urban Development secretary-designate who warns that subsidized housing fosters dependency. 
His domestic team would have been a good fit for just about any of his Republican primary rivals, though Trump's friendly stance toward Russia and its provocative president, Vladimir Putin, is at odds with GOP tradition and the party's leading congressional voices on foreign policy. 
So far, Trump's choices -- including top jobs for a trio of veterans of Goldman Sachs, a firm he blasted at campaign rallies -- haven't reflected the populist impulses that fueled his appeal to some white working-class voters or his vow to "drain the swamp" in Washington of donors and other insiders. 
"I think we're going to have one of the great Cabinets ever put together," Trump boasted. The nominations, announced via Twitter and at campaign-style rallies, provide clues about how he will operate and what he will do after the Inauguration. 
Here are some things we're learning: 
'I like generals' 
"I think generals are terrific, you know?" Trump said in Sunday's interview on Fox News. "They go through schools and they sort of end up at the top of the pyramid, and it's like a test. They passed the test of life." He's picked three of them to top jobs: retired Marine Corps general James "Mad Dog" Mattis as secretary of Defense, retired Marine Corps general John Kelly as secretary of Homeland Security, and retired Army general Michael Flynn as national security adviser. 
He's also met at Trump Tower with retired Army general David Petraeus and retired Navy admiral James Stavridis as he weighed the possibilities for secretary of State. 
Corporate command 
Not since the Eisenhower administration have so many business executives landed top government jobs, making Trump's Cabinet the wealthiest in American history. "I want people that made a fortune because now they're negotiating with you," he told supporters Thursday in Des Moines during his "thank you" tour. "It's not different than a great baseball player or a great golfer." 
He has designated former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Bannon as his senior White House strategist, Goldman veteran Steve Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as Commerce secretary and billionaire activist Betsy DeVos as Education secretary. Another billionaire, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, has been named deputy Commerce secretary. 
Linda McMahon, a former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, has been chosen to head the Small Business Administration. A millionaire who is married to a billionaire, she contributed $7 million to pro-Trump super PACs this fall. 
Climate-change campaign in the crosshairs 
Last week, environmental activists were encouraged when Trump met with former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, both activists on climate change. Then the president-elect selected as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt -- a skeptic of climate change who repeatedly has sued the EPA to push back regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. 
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., an ally of the fossil-fuel industry, is reported to be Trump's choice to lead the Interior Department. She has supported legislation to open the Atlantic Ocean to drilling and prevent the Interior Department from regulating hydraulic fracturing. 
Russian roulette 
Trump's stance on Russia, including his call for more cooperation with Putin, puts him at odds with many of the Republicans allied with him on other fronts. Some of the top appointments he has made or is considering are aligned with his views. Flynn sat next to Putin last year during a paid appearance in Moscow for Russia Today, a TV network financed by the Kremlin. Tillerson, who has negotiated business deals with Putin for years, was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. 
Trump disputed the conclusion in an unpublished CIA report that Russia tried to intervene in the election to boost his prospects. "I think it's ridiculous," he said. "I don't believe it."

Coal's decline may continue under Trump administration: Cheap shale gas has become major force in energy markets

Abstract 
For Trump, a climate-change skeptic, getting rid of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon emissions from power plants by 32% by 2030, would give a boost to the declining U.S. coal industry and its decimated workforce across Appalachia. 

Full Text 
During his campaign for the White House, President-elect Donald Trump promised to eliminate regulations that target coal-fired power plants, one of the primary causes of 
carbon emissions responsible for climate change. 
For Trump, a climate-change skeptic, getting rid of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon emissions from power plants by 32% by 2030, would 
give a boost to the declining U.S. coal industry and its decimated workforce across Appalachia. 

Even if the next president were to succeed, he would probably not reverse a years-long movement away from coal in the U.S. electric power industry, the biggest consumer of 

the black rock, according to the head of one of the nation's leading electric utilities. 
"If he were able to do that, I don't know really how much impact it would have because we're moving ahead and rebalancing our portfolio," Nick Akins, the president and CEO of 
American Electric Power, said recently. 

"I think it's going to be very difficult for new coal-fired generation to get developed," he said. 
Obama-era policies requiring reductions in emissions of carbon, mercury and other pollutants have contributed to coal's loss of market share in the power sector. 
Even more significant has been record U.S. production of cheap shale gas, thanks to hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, plus the slow but steady penetration of wind 

and solar energy into power markets. 

"It's a seven-year construction cycle for a coal unit; 15 years for a nuclear unit," Akins said in a phone call from AEP's Columbus, Ohio, headquarters. "You can develop a natural 
gas plant in two to three years, with a lot less risk for shareholders, and the price of natural gas as a fuel source is still substantially low. 
"And there are areas of the country that benefit from low-cost renewable fuels, particularly wind, and solar continues to come down as well, particularly utility-scale solar. Those 

are areas that will continue to develop." 

For AEP, which has 5.4 million customers in 11 states, coal's share of the company's generating capacity has fallen from 71% in 2005 to about 47% in 2017. Over that time, gas 
capacity has risen from 20% to 27%, and renewable energy has jumped from 3% to 13%. 
The switch is happening even faster across the USA, where gas surpasses coal as a fuel for power plants. 
All told, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects gas to provide an average of 34% of the electricity generated in the USA in 2016, compared with 30% for coal. 
Also figuring heavily in utility investment decisions are changing expectations among customers, especially demands for "clean energy" among younger customers. 
"There's no doubt that there's an element of environmental stewardship that continues to be part of the fabric of our investment thesis," Akins said. 
Trump's bid to reverse Obama environmental policies may provide a reprieve for some older coal power plants, though gas prices, if they remain low, will probably cut into those 

units' operating time, according to the utility chief. 
At the same time, Trump's bullish support for gas production and pipeline construction may exacerbate coal's competitive problems. 
"We'll still have the capacity available, but we won't be using the units as much, and you'll see more utilization of natural gas to back up intermittent renewable energy," Akins 

said. 
Trump's commitment to promote new infrastructure may benefit companies such as AEP, whose 40,000-mile electric transmission network is the largest in the USA. 
AEP spends more than $3 billion a year on transmission improvements, including projects designed to bring new renewable and distributed energy to market. 
"There's no question that jobs are being created on the infrastructure side of things," he said. 

As for communities where AEP has shuttered coal power plants, the company works with economic-development officials in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia to see whether the sites can be marketed for new manufacturing. 
"If the Trump administration really wants to focus on that part of the country, it really ought to think of them like the Go Zones in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina," Akins said, referring to a law passed by Congress in 2005 that provided tax incentives for businesses locating in areas in three states devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Solar use among energy reform measures featured on state ballots

Abstract 
Backed by investor-owned utilities such as Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy, the referendum would invite state regulators to change or abandon so-called "net-metering" policies, which require utilities to provide credits to customers for solar power they produce but don't consume themselves, according to critics of the initiative. 

Full Text 
Ballot measures Tuesday in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Washington could reshape the future for fossil fuels, electricity and renewable energy in those markets. 
Each initiative illustrates how significant decisions on the production and consumption of energy in the U.S. are often made at the state level, especially with gridlock in 
Washington over federal policies. 
In Colorado, voters will decide whether to make it more difficult to amend the state's constitution, following recent unsuccessful attempts by opponents of hydraulic fracturing to 

restrict the process used to extract oil and natural gas from shale deposits. 

Amendment 71 would require the approval of at least 55% of the votes cast to change Colorado's constitution, instead of a simple majority, as well as the signatures of at least 
2% of the registered voters in each of the state's 35 senate districts to put a proposal on the ballot. 
The Colorado oil and gas industry has contributed heavily in support of the "Raise the Bar" initiative, following failed bids by environmentalists this year and in 2014 to put anti­
fracking measures before state voters. 

But support for Amendment 71 is broader than just oil and gas interests, including the state's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, who says changing Colorado's 
constitution should be more difficult than it is now. 
Meanwhile, voters in Florida and Nevada will face referenda arising from controversies over solar energy and the extent to which residents and businesses should be able to rely 

more on rooftop panels and less on their local utility. 

Amendment 1 in Florida would give residents a state constitutional right to own or lease solar equipment installed on their property to generate electricity for their own use, 
something that's already provided for under state law. 
But what makes the Florida initiative especially controversial is another provision that would ensure that consumers who don't install solar equipment aren't required to 

subsidize the costs of backup power and grid access to those with solar panels. 

Backed by investor-owned utilities such as Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy, the referendum would invite state regulators to change or abandon so-called "net-metering" 
policies, which require utilities to provide credits to customers for solar power they produce but don't consume themselves, according to critics of the initiative. 
Utilities in Florida, Nevada and other states maintain the net-metering policy is unfair to non-solar customers, including those in low-income neighborhoods who can't afford 

solar panels and end up paying more to maintain the local grid. 
Opponents of the ballot item say it's a move to maintain the utilities' monopoly in the Sunshine State by keeping out third-party providers of solar power. 
A similar debate is taking place in Nevada, where an "energy choice" initiative would give customers the right to pick their power provider in an open retail market based on 

price, reliability and other factors, or produce their own electricity from solar and other renewable energy sources and sell any excess power on the open market. 
If approved by voters Tuesday, the initiative would require passage a second time in 2018 before taking effect by 2023. 
Supporters of Nevada's energy-choice proposal include MGM Resorts International, which is using existing law to sever ties to NV Energy, the state's largest utility, and Tesla, 

the electric-car maker which is building a major battery factory in the state. 
NV Energy is remaining neutral on the initiative. 
Of the several state energy-related referenda, the one that could have the most far-reaching implications is one in Washington state that would apply a carbon tax to coal, 

natural gas and oil. 
Initiative 732 is seen by many advocates of a carbon tax as a model for other states and perhaps the entire U.S. to lower emissions that contribute to global warming. 
Backed by a campaign called Carbon Washington, the initiative is designed to be revenue-neutral, gradually increasing the carbon tax while reducing sales and other sales taxes. 

The levy would start at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in 2017 and rise to $100 per metric ton by mid-century. 
The Washington measure is stirring controversy, even among environmentalists, some of whom oppose it for failing to dedicate revenue to green energy technology and low-income consumers.

Coal-mining town's fate hangs on Election Day: Clinton victory seen as a death knell for small Craig, Colo.

Abstract 
[...]the shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewables seems all but inevitable. Because Craig means coal. Many people in Craig are frustrated that federal officials give so much weight and attention to protecting obscure wildlife and don't do enough to respect another endangered species: the American coal miner, the rancher, those who live a Western life, where posses helped bring outlaws to justice and the government was a distant presence. 

Full Text 
None of the yards have "I'm With Her" signs in this town of 10,000 in Colorado's northwestern corner. The only Hillary Clinton sign you'll see suggests she be imprisoned. 
Pick any controversy, and the folks in Craig can discuss it at length. The private email server. The Clinton Foundation. Benghazi. 
"She should be in jail," says Brenda Anderson, a cleaner for the local health clinic. "It seems like the woman gets away with a lot." 
But absolutely nothing gets residents here as riled up as a comment Clinton made on March 13 during a town hall discussion. Speaking about climate change, greenhouse gases 

and renewable energy, Clinton said something the people in Craig can't forgive: "We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business " 

That comment came during a discussion about the importance of job retraining and helping coal miners learn skills for new jobs because the natural gas boom and efforts to fight climate change already are financially burdening coal mines. At this point, the shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewables seems all but inevitable. But that doesn't matter much right here, right now. Because Craig means coal. And for its residents, anything that feels like an attack on coal is an attack on them, their 
livelihood, their entire way of life. And that means, more than almost anywhere else, Craig's fate seemingly hangs on Election Day. 
Residents here see a Clinton presidency as a death knell for their town. They believe Clinton and the EPA will continue President Obama's efforts to tighten the laws governing 

coal-burning power plants, prompting them to just shut down rather than spend many more millions of dollars complying with Clean Air requirements. It's not an idle fear: One 
of the mines outside Craig has already declared bankruptcy, although it's still operating. 
The three coal mines near Craig help feed the two nearby power plants. They provide hundreds of good-paying jobs. 
Being a Republican is about as natural as breathing for these Americans living far from the urban life of Uber and grocery delivery and office jobs. In this county, Republicans 

outnumber Democrats 4-1. 
Steve Smith, 64, spent 35 years running a dragline at the Trapper Mine, tearing apart a mountainside to get at the coal beneath. Now retired and nursing a broken wrist from a 

logging accident, Smith has time to watch television political news. He's disgusted by what he sees and worries politicians are drifting too far from the Founding Fathers' ideals of limited government and personal responsibility. Many people in Craig are frustrated that federal officials give so much weight and attention to protecting obscure wildlife and don't do enough to respect another endangered 
species: the American coal miner, the rancher, those who live a Western life, where posses helped bring outlaws to justice and the government was a distant presence. 
"They overstep in a lot of places," Smith says. 
So when a group of ranchers took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon earlier this year, people like Smith took notice. The ranchers, led by Ammon Bundy, argued the federal 

government was overstepping its authority in a variety of areas, especially in managing lands. An armed confrontation between one of the men and authorities left the protester dead, but a jury last month acquitted the remaining protesters of any federal crime. Smith says he's impressed the Bundy group "stepped up" and took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest. 
While people here are angry at the idea that Clinton could become president, no one is ready to take such a drastic step to protect their livelihood. At least, not yet. 
"Would we take up arms? Probably not," Smith says. "It would be hard to accept Hillary. You'd still keep fighting the system, but the system is rigged." 
Danny Griffith laughs at the idea of the residents of this coal mining town ever doing anything like the Malheur protest. The owner of JW Snack's bar, Griffith depends heavily on 

the salaries of the coal miners and power plant workers, who buy cheeseburgers and beer and wings. 
Still, he allows that tensions are running high here, so high that he's temporarily banned bar visitors from discussing presidential politics, religion or abortion. 

He considers the election the chance to "pick the best loser" and worries a Clinton presidency will kill first the coal mines and power plants, then businesses like his, and then the entire town. 
Post-election, Griffith, 58, says most Craig residents will be looking at their household finances. If Clinton wins, he thinks those who can leave town will likely seek work elsewhere. 
"Everyone is afraid of what's going to happen to the economy," Griffith says. "The people who don't like Hillary really, really, really don't like her. It could be Hillary vs. Howdy Doody and they'd vote Howdy Doody because he's not Hillary Clinton."

Abstract 
Carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for man-made climate change, is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal. 

Full Text 
Think you aren't personally responsible for climate change? Think again. The average American causes about 600 square feet of Arctic sea ice to vanish each year, according to a study released Thursday, and something as simple as your summer road trip may be to blame. The study, the first to provide this level of detail about the link between carbon pollution and Arctic ice, shows how human carbon emissions are playing a devastating role. The study found that summer Arctic sea ice will be gone in 30 years and that means more volatile weather patterns unless carbon emissions are reduced rapidly. Sea ice is frozen ocean water that melts each summer, then refreezes each winter. Its summertime area has been shrinking each year by nearly 34,000 square 
miles, according to the National 
Snow and Ice Data Center. The study, which combined observations, statistics and dozens of computer models, appeared in the journal Science. A lack of Arctic sea has been linked to the ongoing drought in California and some of the recent massive snowstorms along the East Coast, said study lead author Dirk Notz of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany. For each ton of carbon dioxide that a person emits anywhere on Earth, 32 square feet of Arctic summer sea ice disappears, Notz said. That's equal to one roundtrip flight from New York to Europe, or a 2,500-mile car ride. Carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for man-made climate change, is emitted from the burning of fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal. The average American emits about 20 tons of carbon dioxide per year, which translates into about 600 square feet of Arctic summer sea ice melting away, the study said. The rapid retreat of sea ice is one of the most direct signs of climate change on our planet, according to the study. "The article confirms some of my worst fears," said Penn State meteorologist Michael Mann, who was not involved in the study. (Copyright (c) 2016 USA Today. All Rights Reserved.)

Abstract 
Voters in Washington state may show the way Nov. 8 when they decide on a referendum that would assess a carbon tax on coal, oil and natural gas, a move aimed at lowering emissions that contribute to climate change without digging deeply into people's wallets. 

Full Text 
Putting a price on carbon emissions remains a divisive topic in the USA, even as polls indicate considerable public support for actions to address climate change. 
Voters in Washington state may show the way Nov. 8 when they decide on a referendum that would assess a carbon tax on coal, oil and natural gas, a move aimed at lowering 
emissions that contribute to climate change without digging deeply into people's wallets. 
Backed by a campaign called Carbon Washington, the initiative is designed to be revenue-neutral, gradually increasing the carbon tax while reducing sales and other state taxes. 

A similar levy was established by neighboring British Columbia in 2008. 

Initiative 732 is stirring up controversy in the Pacific Northwest state, and polls show that its outcome on Election Day is uncertain. If enacted, it would be the first state carbon 
tax in the USA. 
Among those pointing to the referendum as a possible prototype for the USA as a whole is Clay Sell, a former top energy official under President George W. Bush. 
Sell told a Washington, D.C., audience the other day that it's time to end the political debate over the cause of climate change and address the phenomenon with a business-

friendly policy. 

"The great challenge for the next administration using the bully pulpit will be to end this fiction, act upon the science and design a carbon pricing scheme that will provide the 
certainty and efficiency that energy investors desire," Sell told a forum held by the U.S. Energy Association. 
"I hope both (political) parties will take that up, as it will allow the benefits of all clean energy technologies to be properly valued in the marketplace," he said. 
To be clear, Sell has a vested interest in clean energy as the president of Hunt Energy Horizons, the renewable energy subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, a Dallas-based energy, 

real estate and investment corporation controlled by billionaire Ray Hunt, whose family's fortune began with oil. 

Nonetheless, Sell, who was the deputy secretary of the Department of Energy from 2005 to 2008 and an energy adviser to Bush before that, said interest in a carbon price is 
growing among business executives, even if it hasn't reached all corners of the oil and gas industry. 
"If I were to take you to the wildcatters' dinner at the Petroleum Club, you would not find me in the broad majority," he said when I asked him how his views go over in Dallas. 

"But people need certainty." 

Sell criticized the "patchwork of overlapping subsidies, mandates and tax benefits" that federal, state and local governments established over the years to promote clean energy 
and reduce emissions. 
Among the mistakes, he maintained, is the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would cut carbon emissions from power plants but not other sectors, such as 

transportation. He called it "completely inadequate" to manage the "global impacts" of carbon emissions. 
That plan, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency after Congress failed to pass climate legislation, is challenged in court by 24 states. 
Sell was just as critical of those in the Republican Party and elsewhere who resist a consensus among scientists that human behavior is the leading cause of climate change. 

Among them is the GOP nominee for president, Donald Trump. 

"I think we need to work more to restore and defend the primacy of science in all policy discussions and decisions," Sell said. "Now, for those Democrats in the room, you may 
be saying, 'Of course, that's what we've been saying for years on climate change. When are you Republicans going to come around?' 
"And I will tell you, I think the Republicans should come around on the primacy of science on that issue," he said. 
"But you know what? People need to come around on the primacy of science as it relates to hydraulic fracturing (for oil and gas drilling), on the primacy of science on what it 

tells us about Yucca Mountain (in Nevada) and its suitability as a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel, and for other projects and initiatives where we allow politics to trump science." 
In the meantime, look to the Pacific Northwest, Sell suggested. 
"I think there are some lessons that could be learned from the initiative in Washington state about a revenue-neutral carbon tax," he said.

Toxic air concentrated at 100 u.s. facilities Indiana sues over epa limits: A handful of industrial sites spew out large amounts of pollution

Abstract 
[...]nearly every direction you go will take you to a coal plant -- seven within 30 miles. The center, which merged two federal data sets to create an unprecedented picture of air emissions, found that a third of the toxic-air releases in 2014 from power plants, factories and other facilities came from 100 complexes out of more than 20,000 reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

Full Text 
To see one of the country's largest coal-fired power plants, head northwest from this Ohio River city. Or east, because there's another in the region. In fact, nearly every direction you go will take you to a coal plant -- seven within 30 miles. 
Collectively, they pump out millions of pounds of toxic air pollution. They emit greenhouse gases on par with Hong Kong or Sweden. 
Industrial air pollution -- bad for people's health, bad for the planet -- is strikingly concentrated in America among a small number of facilities such as those in southwest Indiana, according to a nine-month Center for Public Integrity investigation in partnership with the USA TODAY Network and the Weather Channel. 
The center, which merged two federal data sets to create an unprecedented picture of air emissions, found that a third of the toxic-air releases in 2014 from power plants, factories and other facilities came from 100 complexes out of more than 20,000 reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
A third of the greenhouse gas emissions reported by facilities came from just 100, too. Some academics have a name for them: super polluters. 
Twenty-two industrial sites appeared on both lists. They include ExxonMobil's refinery and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas, and a slew of coal-fired power plants. Four are in a single region -- southwest Indiana. 
Thomas McGarity, a law professor and regulatory scholar at the University of Texas-Austin, said the findings show "a lot of the problem is isolated, and what we need to do is focus in on these plants." 
The EPA says it's doing that. In a written statement, the agency said its sustained emphasis on the utility sector has led to "dramatically" lower emissions from power plants since 1990 -- "while the U.S. economy has continued to grow" -- and it works to get further improvements. 
Not all the states are on board. Indiana is one of 27 suing the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which would require reductions in climate-altering greenhouse gas pollution from electric utilities. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence -- Donald Trump's running mate -- is a pro-coal, climate-change skeptic who says the costs of shifting to cleaner energy sources are too high. 
"Unfortunately, President Obama's Clean Power Plan will drive up electricity prices, threaten electricity reliability and put coal miners out of work," Pence spokeswoman Kara Brooks said by email. 
The EPA contends its plan would modestly reduce U.S. electricity bills long term and says it is working with the power sector to ensure reliability. 
Maintaining the status quo has real costs: bad air that threatens health and fuels global warming. Across the country, the top 100 facilities releasing greenhouse gases -- almost all of them coal plants -- collectively added more than a billion metric tons to the atmosphere in 2014. That's the equivalent of a year's worth of such emissions from 219 million passenger vehicles -- nearly twice as many as the total number registered nationwide. 
The top 100 facilities for toxic-air emissions vented more than 270 million pounds of chemicals in 2014. The vast majority of those chemicals carry health risks, according to the EPA; they can target the lungs or other organs, and some can affect children's development. Eight of the super polluters have closed since 2014. The rest, including all four in Indiana, still operate. 
Tina Dearing, 48, from Huntingburg, Ind., was widowed in March when her 57-year-old husband died of a heart attack. Two months later, researchers published the results of a 10-year study showing that pollution appears to accelerate harmful deposits in the arteries that cause nearly all heart attacks and most strokes. 
Dearing's family lives within 30 miles of two of Indiana's largest coal plants. She knows a variety of factors can play a role in an early death, but she said she believes dirty air contributed in her husband's case. "The air quality stinks," she said. 
African-American and poor people make up an outsize share of those living near the 100 polluters releasing the most airborne chemicals, as reported to the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory. These facilities can degrade air far afield. Almost all the states with top toxic-air emitters send a significant amount of pollution to downwind states, some hundreds of miles away, according to EPA analyses. 
Owners of some super polluters say their emissions break no rules and are simply a reflection of a facility's size. 
Others say they've ratcheted down releases in recent years. 
NRG Energy, which owns or co-owns several coal plants on the top 100 lists, said its toxic air emissions are falling, and it has set aggressive climate goals that would mean a major overhaul in the way it makes power. 
"Things can't continue on the same path as they have for decades," Bruno Sarda, NRG Energy's new chief sustainability officer, said of businesses worldwide.

More willing to pay to fight climate change, survey says: 57% would pay $1 more on electric bill for climate action

Abstract 
Coming just two months before the November elections, the EPIC-AP survey concludes that energy and climate change are "important issues" for about half of likely voters as they cast their ballots. [...]the results raise questions about the extent of local support for a legal challenge of Obama administration climate policy by 24 states. 

Full Text 
How much would you pay on your electric bill to combat climate change? 
Is $10 or $20 a month reasonable? $50 too much? 
Or, maybe you're unwilling to shell out anything at all. 
A new survey offers some insight regarding the extent to which Americans consider climate change a legitimate threat and how much they're willing to pay for government 

policies that would respond to the phenomena. 

Conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, the inquiry found that 65% of 
Americans think climate change is a problem that the government needs to address, including 84% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans. 
Those findings are consistent with previous polls on the topic. But what's different in this survey is its look at Americans' willingness to reach into their own pockets to help keep 

temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. 

In all, 57% of those polled said they would pay at least $1 more on their monthly electric bill for climate action, including 29% who would pay $20 a month, an amount 
comparable to federal government estimates of damages from climate change per household. 
Twenty percent indicated they would pay $50. 
Clearly, resistance to footing a higher electric bill is considerable, too, with 42% of the respondents saying they were unwilling to pay even $1 for such policies. One percent of 

the participants didn't respond to the question. 

Party affiliation is the main determinant of how much cost people would bear, not education, income or geographic location, with Democrats consistently willing to pay more 
than Republicans, the survey's authors said. 
Still, the findings indicate more public support for paying for climate policies such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade plan or other regulation than may have been evident before, 

according to Michael Greenstone, the director of EPIC. 
"I think what this says is that quietly there is developing a change in peoples' attitudes with respect to paying for climate policy," Greenstone said in an interview. 
"I found it striking that one in five households were willing to pay $50 a month," he added. 
Among other survey results: 
54% of Americans (67% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans) favor federal regulations that would reduce U.S. coal use, though that support slips to 45% when the question 

is paired with the assertion that such regulations have resulted in the loss of coal jobs; 

Only a quarter of Americans are confident that the U.S. will meet its obligations under an international climate agreement reached in Paris last December, but eight in 10 say the 
country should still try to meet those responsibilities. 
Coming just two months before the November elections, the EPIC-AP survey concludes that energy and climate change are "important issues" for about half of likely voters as 

they cast their ballots. 
Moreover, the results raise questions about the extent of local support for a legal challenge of Obama administration climate policy by 24 states. 
Still, in an election year when the personalities of the Democratic and Republican nominees for president attract more attention than specific issues, it's difficult to determine 

how much public perceptions on an issue like climate change may play a part in determining which candidate wins. 

The survey wasn't limited to climate change; it also probed public opinions on the use of hydraulic fracturing to produce gas from shale formations -- one which has led to 

record gas output in the U.S. in recent years. 
Of the six in 10 respondents who had an opinion on fracking, twice as many oppose the practice as support it. Not surprising, the disapproval is much more prevalent among 
Democrats than Republicans. 

"I think fracking is still pretty new," Greenstone said. "Outside of the communities where it's taking place, I think those views are probably still evolving."

Shell CEO sees red lights on path to greener energy: Oil giant cites struggle of curbing emissions as demand grows

Abstract 
[...]the 109-year-old oil giant sees itself becoming gradually greener. 

Full Text 
It's no surprise major oil companies are viewed as contrarians when it comes to climate change, even though all of them acknowledge the phenomenon and agree on the need 
for a response to one extent or another. 
After all, keeping temperatures from rising to catastrophic levels will require the world to wean itself off fossil fuels and turn to cleaner forms of energy, hardly an appealing 
proposition to the financial well-being of oil producers. But now the leader of one of the world's biggest oil companies is telling his peers to accept the role unapologetically. 

"When it comes to some of the beliefs about the challenge of the energy transition, which may be founded on less than solid fact, our industry should not shy away from being 

the contrarian in the room," Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, told an oil conference in Norway recently. 
"All of us here today have a pivotal role to play in shaping the energy system of the future. With our knowledge, we have some indispensable -- and you could say, contrarian -­insights to offer." 

With that, van Beurden ticked off the difficulties of curbing emissions as demand for energy grows, especially in developing countries. 

"The underlying question is: How far can countries transform their economies to meet demand and reduce emissions at the same time?" he asked. "And, crucially: How fast can 
they do that? 
"Social, political and geographical conditions vary from country to country. So the energy transition is likely to play out in a different way in different places. In some places, it 

will be relatively fast; in others, relatively slow." 

Oil, coal and natural gas -- the primary culprits behind climate change -- will remain essential on a large scale for years for long-distance air travel, heavy road transportation, 
steelmaking and other sectors, he said in remarks prepared for the Offshore Northern Seas Conference in Stavanger on Aug. 29. 
His speech came six days before President Obama and China President Xi Jinping formally entered their two nations into last year's Paris climate agreement, which aims to hold 

the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels. 
Obama calls the landmark accord "the single best chance we have" to save the planet. 
The Anglo-Dutch company is no opponent of the climate deal; in fact, Shell has taken a formal position that the agreement "could provide greater certainty about how the world 

can provide more energy with much less carbon dioxide." 
Nor is Shell absent when it comes to lower-carbon and no-carbon alternatives. 
With its $52 billion acquisition of BG Group earlier this year, Shell became the world's top liquefied natural gas company at a time when gas, which emits half the carbon dioxide 

of coal, is displacing coal as a fuel for electricity generation around the globe. 

The company backs projects in Norway, Canada and other countries seeking commercially viable ways of capturing carbon emissions from coal- and gas-burning power plants 
and burying them deep underground. In fact, the 109-year-old oil giant sees itself becoming gradually greener. 
"As we have explained to our investors, new energies like wind, hydrogen and biofuels will become essential parts of our portfolio over time," van Beurden said. 
But despite dire warnings by scientists of the potential for a climate catastrophe if the rise in temperatures isn't curbed relatively soon, and his own company's acknowledgment 

of the problem, van Beurden cautions that suggestions of a quick fix can be deceptive. 

"In other words," he concluded, "this century's landscape will inevitably be a patchwork of renewables and hydrocarbons. Or, to put it differently, some level of emissions will remain for some time." Credit: Bill Loveless, @bill_loveless , Special for USA TODAY

Abstract 
Human-cased, heat-trapping greenhouses played a "measurable" role in the colossal rainfall totals, which were fueled by high humidity and a stalled storm system above the Gulf Coast, said Karin van der Wiel, a scientist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the report's lead author. 

Full Text 
Climate change played a major role in the historic rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding in Louisiana last month, nearly doubling the chance of such a deluge taking place, according to a fast-tracked federal report released Wednesday. 
Many spots picked up more than 2 feet of rain in the state, which was drenched by about 7.1trillion gallons of water, three times the amount Hurricane Katrina dumped there in 2005. 
An estimated 30,000 people needed to be rescued from floodwaters that killed 13 people and damaged 60,000 homes in what the Red Cross called the nation's worst natural disaster since 2012. 
Human-cased, heat-trapping greenhouses played a "measurable" role in the colossal rainfall totals, which were fueled by high humidity and a stalled storm system above the Gulf Coast, said Karin van der Wiel, a scientist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the report's lead author. 
The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere, which has warmed to levels that cannot be explained by natural variability, scientists say. Rainfall patterns and humidity levels are also affected by this process, as warmer air can hold additional amounts of water vapor. 
Computer models analyzed the amount of rain that caused the flooding, van der Wiel said. The rainfall Louisiana experienced "is now expected to occur at least 40% more often" than before the mid-1800s, the report stated. 
The report is an example of a single-event attribution study released rapidly to catch the public's eye while an extreme weather event is fresh in people's minds, NOAA said. 
The information is also critical to insurers, policymakers, engineers and emergency managers to prepare for more climate-change-fueled events down the road, said Heidi Cullen, chief scientist at Climate Central, an independent climate science and news organization. 
The study has been submitted to Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, an interactive, open access journal of the European Geosciences Union.

Abstract 
Peaceful protest and civil disobedience have played a critical role in changing minds and policies in this country -- from shutting down bridges and freeways in the fight for civil rights to shutting down coal plants in the fight for our planet's future, from suffragettes marching in the streets for the right to vote to activists raising the alarm about AIDS awareness. 

Full Text 
One of the earliest policy impacts of the Black Lives Matter movement was a May 2015 federal ban on transferring certain militarized equipment to local police departments. The ban largely began in response to startling images of police officers, their weapons raised, confronting unarmed protesters. Those images shocked not only the general public but military experts as well. 
But after the horrible killing of five officers in Dallas, several law enforcement officials urged the White House to lift the ban on militarized equipment for local police departments. As election season reaches full boil, the posturing from those claiming to stand for "law and order" poses real threats to one of the hallmarks of American society: the right to peacefully protest. 
The ban on military equipment was a direct response to the national debate on greater police accountability, criminal justice reform and an honest and effective approach to end systemic racial injustice. But it also influences every activist in this country who believes in the right to protest without the threat of violence. 
It's impossible for any groups to win fights against Arctic drilling, the Keystone XL Pipeline and new fossil fuel leasing, or for action to combat global climate change, without the opportunity to protest. But persuading people to protest under threat or intimidation becomes more difficult when police are ill-trained and militarized. Federally arming police with weapons of war silences protesters across all justice movements. 
Peaceful protest and civil disobedience have played a critical role in changing minds and policies in this country -- from shutting down bridges and freeways in the fight for civil rights to shutting down coal plants in the fight for our planet's future, from suffragettes marching in the streets for the right to vote to activists raising the alarm about AIDS awareness. These tactics of disruption have frequently been the only avenue available to stop legal, yet devastating, practices. 
We have seen abuses of power exerted by militarized police forces across the globe -- an over-reaching police apparatus can intimidate and stifle demonstrators through consistent, peremptory and heavy-handed exhibitions of lethal force. Some news media outlets regularly misrepresent peaceful protest as violent and threatening. But people demanding justice, accountability or basic human rights without resorting to violence should not be greeted with machine guns and tanks. 
Peaceful protest is democracy in action. It is a forum for those who feel disempowered or disenfranchised. 
As we grapple with the fundamental problems in our criminal justice system, we need to build a safer environment for freedom of assembly and expression. Let's keep grenade launchers and armored vehicles off our streets.

Trump not the only one fed up with regulations

Abstract 
International accords in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as well as prescriptions in Dodd-Frank have led to the doubling and tripling of the amount of equity capital banks must hold as a buffer against losses, with riskier activities requiring more capital. 

Full Text 
Often lost in the name-calling and scaremongering in the presidential campaign is the debate about fundamental issues that affect most of us, and one of the biggest of those is 
regulation. 
Fueled by big campaign donations from Wall Street and other businesses, Republican politicians traditionally have pushed back on regulations, claiming their costs exceed their 
benefits and that they bury business under mountains of paperwork that inhibit growth and investment. 

So Donald Trump is squarely in the Republican tradition when he proposes, as he did in an economic policy speech Monday, to roll back regulations in all spheres and to call for 

a moratorium in new rule making. 
"This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs and expanding businesses," 
Trump said of this freeze on new regulations. 

As Trump listed the weight of regulations, footnoting each item with authoritative sources, he raised the question of whether this longstanding Republican complaint might finally be right and regulations have become counterproductive. 
Federal regulations, according to Trump's various sources, cost businesses $2 trillion a year and have slowed growth in the economy since 1980 by 25%. 
The federal register, which lists rules and proposed rule making, now runs to more than 80,000 pages, Trump noted. President Obama has issued nearly 400 new major 
regulations since taking office, the Republican nominee said, citing a Wall Street Journal report from April, each costing the economy at least $100 million. 

In his speech to the Detroit Economic Club, Trump did not repeat pledges he has made in the campaign to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform, with its multitude of regulations. Rather, he lumped them together with all other types of rules, especially those regulating energy and the environment, with the promise, "I am going to cut regulations massively." 
But it's not that easy to undo regulations, especially after businesses have invested millions in complying with them. 
Even a moratorium on new rules can be difficult to apply to independent regulatory agencies -- set up by statute precisely to shield them from executive branch interference -­which have their specific mandates set by Congress. This is the case of most financial regulators and the legal prescriptions they have from Dodd-Frank. 
Still, Trump's shotgun blast against regulation raises the legitimate question of whether the government has gone too far. 
In the financial sphere, for instance, the outgoing banking correspondent for The New York Times, Nathaniel Popper, summed up his six years on the beat by questioning how 

effective the plethora of individual banking regulations in Dodd-Frank have been. 

But, he acknowledged in the paper's magazine, one measure that has been very successful in reducing the type of risk banks take on is the set of "rather arcane accounting 
rules known as capital requirements." 
International accords in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as well as prescriptions in Dodd-Frank have led to the doubling and tripling of the amount of equity capital banks 

must hold as a buffer against losses, with riskier activities requiring more capital. 

The Federal Reserve governor responsible for turning these legal mandates into specific regulations, Daniel Tarullo, has been aggressive in implementing them, sometimes 
exceeding even the minimum requirements. 
"The most immediate impact of these rules has been to serve as a sort of brake on business activity, given the hassle and cost of raising more capital," Popper recounted. "And 

indeed, when banks today explain why they are moving into or abandoning certain businesses, they almost always cite capital requirements as their main motivation." 
Given the effectiveness of this single requirement in reducing bank risk, perhaps all these other rules are not so urgent. 
Even as the banking lobby has delayed implementation of other rules, many banks have nonetheless effectively adopted them in anticipation of the rule making. Often, too, 

many of the speculative businesses targeted by the rules have simply become less profitable. 

In the same way, electric utilities, for instance, have long since shifted away from investment in coal-fired plants in anticipation of ever tougher emission standards, but also 
because domestic natural gas has become a much cheaper alternative. 
Many voters concerned about climate change would not welcome abandonment of emission standards, as Trump advocates with his pledge to restore coal as an energy source. 
But some voters may agree it is time for the regulation pendulum to swing the other way.

Abstract 
Clinton "cares deeply about protecting public health and the environment," Sittenfeld said The gap between presidential candidates has grown since the 2008 election, when GOP nominee John McCain expressed concern about climate change, said Kevin Curtis, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. The libertarian Cato Institute calls the Democratic platform "chock full of government actions that promise to initiate, broaden and extend the current set of rules, regulations and orders seeking to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels as our primary source of energy production." 

Full Text 
Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offer Americans starkly different views on global warming: Clinton says it is an urgent concern. Trump dismisses it as a minor problem. 
"There's never been a bigger contrast between the two candidates and the two platforms," said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. The Trump campaign decried Clinton's policy proposals Tuesday as an "extreme, reckless anti-energy agenda to appease radical donors (who) will destroy millions of jobs and force millions more into abject poverty." 
The GOP nominee said nothing about climate change in his acceptance speech July 21 at the Republican National Convention. He told a rally in South Carolina in December that global warming was "a hoax, a lot of it," a modest change from a tweet in 2013 that called global warming "bulls---." 
He's rejected climate science even though climate is thoroughly researched, said Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Defense Action Fund. 
"Climate change is real," the Democratic nominee said in her acceptance speech Thursday. Clinton said she was proud the United States had signed a climate accord in Paris 
that commits the world's nations to slow the rise of greenhouse gases blamed for warming the climate. 

Clinton "cares deeply about protecting public health and the environment," Sittenfeld said 

The gap between presidential candidates has grown since the 2008 election, when GOP nominee John McCain expressed concern about climate change, said Kevin Curtis, 
executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. 
Clinton's campaign website has more than 30 pages of proposals for fighting climate change. They include installing a half-billion solar panels by the end of her term and 

ensuring that every U.S. home is powered by renewable energy within 10 years. 
Those goals are "ambitious," Curtis said. "And we think that's great. If she's elected, we'll be badgering her to do more." 
Trump has promised to slash funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. Last week, he was asked on Fox News if global warming was caused by human activity. "It could 

have a minor impact," Trump said. "But nothing, nothing to what they're talking about." 
The Sierra Club issued a paper July 12 saying that if elected, Trump would be the only world leader who did not believe in the science of climate change. 
"Leaders of all nations accept the scientific consensus that man is fueling climate change by burning fossil fuels and are calling for urgent action," the report states. Support 

comes from leaders of 195 countries, including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. 

"We wanted to be very clear about where Donald Trump ranks among other world leaders, and he's at the very bottom," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the Sierra Club "lobbies for the closure of American coal mines and celebrates the loss of countless, good-paying energy jobs for American 
workers." 
The platforms adopted by the Republican and Democratic Parties underscore the candidates' glaring differences. 
The Republicans emphasize American energy independence. Their platform advocates reviving construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would bring crude oil from 

Canada to Nebraska, and killing an EPA plan to reduce power plant emissions. It seeks to take regulatory control away from the federal government and give it to the states. Though the party encourages the development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, it says it should be done entirely by private capital. It says coal is clean, an assertion that rankles environmentalists. 
"It is a fantasy and wishful thinking," Symons said. "Coal kills thousands of people a year." 
The Democratic platform says climate change "is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time" and takes dire note of rising seas, brutal drought, "superstorms" and multiplying wildfires. It argues that embracing clean energy technology will create "millions of new jobs" and cut home and business expenses. 
"It's the most pro-environment platform we've ever seen," Sittenfeld said. 
The libertarian Cato Institute calls the Democratic platform "chock full of government actions that promise to initiate, broaden and extend the current set of rules, regulations and orders seeking to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels as our primary source of energy production." 
"A Democratic administration will seek a further expansion of the reach of the federal government into our daily lives," the institute said on its website. 
Decades ago, Sittenfeld noted, environment issues enjoyed bipartisan support. The Clean Water Act of 1972 was passed with support from both parties and signed into law by President Richard Nixon, a Republican. 
Whether the sharp divide between Trump and Clinton will move voters is unclear. Though the number of voters who say they believe in climate change has increased -- including 47% of conservatives -- the percentage "alarmed" by global warming is still small, said research scientist Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. 
"American engagement with this issue is at levels that we haven't seen since the latest high water mark in 2008," he said.

Full Text 
The retirement of coal and nuclear power plants in the USA over the past few years raised concerns that the electric power industry might fail to deliver when demand for power 
heightened -- such as during a blistering heat wave. 
For the most part, that's not the case this week as a "heat dome" leaves the eastern and central parts of the USA sweltering in temperatures of 95 degrees or more and feeling 
as though it's much hotter. 

"So far, so good," said Michael Bryson, the vice president for systems operations at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the largest electric grid in the USA. "Our transmission 

and generation have been performing very well." 
PJM, which coordinates transmission and operates a wholesale electricity market in a region covering 13 states and the District of Columbia, recorded a high point for demand of 
nearly 152,000 megawatts Monday and forecast a peak of 145,600 megawatts Tuesday as temperatures tapered off a bit. 

One megawatt is enough to power 800 to 1,000 homes. 

That corresponds with PJM's forecasts of peak demand this summer and falls well within the 184,000 megawatts of installed generating capacity in the system that serves Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, among other states. 
The story is similar across other regions to the north, south and west of PJM's market where the massive heat wave has lingered, Bryson said in an interview. 
Though some disruptions have occurred, such as severe thunder storms that combined with the searing weather to black out 14,000 Con Edison customers in New York, the 

bulk power system has run relatively smoothly. 
"They're all in a similar position as us," Bryson said of the other grid operators. "We're kind of stressing the system a little bit, but all of us are in pretty good shape." 
This comes as electric power generators close coal and nuclear plants that cannot compete with low-price natural gas and government-supported solar and wind power. 
More such shutdowns are anticipated under the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector by 30% by 2030, 

compared with 2005 levels. 
That strategy was put on hold by the Supreme Court in February while a lower court considers a lawsuit by 24 states challenging its legality. 
Regardless of the outcome, executives of many utilities plan to continue to reduce their reliance on coal in response to public and investor concerns over climate change, as well 

as state policies that promote green energy. 

Amid those changes, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., an industry group that promotes dependable electricity supplies, cautions that regulators and power providers must take into account the need for new capacity and other infrastructure to keep the grid operating well. Bryson isn't seeing such risks, even with Mother Nature breathing down the backs of those who keep bulk power supplies flowing. "We constantly focus on what is the impact on 
reliability. And again, particularly from a capacity standpoint," he said, "we think we still have a very reliable grid." Credit: Bill Loveless, Special for USA TODAY

Abstract 
According to the international law firm Haynes and Boone, 85 operators in the U.S. and Canada have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2015 and "many more" are likely to do so over the rest of the year. 

Full Text 
Energy isn't a marquee event at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. 
But the topic will have its moment in the spotlight Wednesday night when the man dubbed the "king of energy" by Donald Trump will take to the podium at Quicken Loans Arena. 
Harold Hamm, who like Trump has made billions of dollars in his career, sees the candidate as someone who will rally behind independent oil and gas producers such as himself as they try to regain their footing in a glutted market. 
"President Trump will not be trying to eliminate oil and gas production in America. That's what's been going on," Hamm, the CEO of Continental Resources, one of the biggest independent producers in the U.S., said in an interview Monday. "We've had death by a thousand cuts with this current administration doing everything possible to stop this energy renaissance in its tracks and put oil and gas operators out of business." 
In fact, many producers are struggling. According to the international law firm Haynes and Boone, 85 operators in the U.S. and Canada have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2015 and "many more" are likely to do so over the rest of the year. 
But the industry's main dilemma is a global surplus of oil that has driven prices down by as much as 70% since June 2014, not regulation. And to a large extent, the oversupply is a result of a resurgence in U.S. oil production over the last few years, thanks to companies such as Continental that use hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to unlock shale reserves. 
That said, Trump and other Republican candidates see President Obama and the presumptive Democratic candidate for president, Hillary Clinton, promoting a regulatory agenda that concentrates on combating climate change at the expense of fossil fuels, especially oil and coal. 
Reinforcing that notion is the Republican Party platform, which is virtually silent on climate change while calling for an "all of the above strategy" for energy, which includes support for private-sector development of technologies for cleaner combustion of coal in power plants, a roll-back in Environmental Protection Agency regulations and a skeptical eye for government aid to renewable energy. 
It's a view that differs sharply from the one Democrats will present at their national convention next week, when worries over climate change, acclamation for Obama administration environmental and alternative-energy policies and calls for even more steps likely will take center stage. 
For Hamm, Wednesday's convention appearance won't be his first encounter with Trump since he met the real estate tycoon several years ago and backed his run for the White House in April. 
Within weeks of that endorsement, Hamm joined Trump at an oil conference in Bismarck, N.D., where the candidate praised Hamm for his company's development of shale reserves in that state and others. 
"I guess we can consider Harold the king of energy. There's nobody like him," Trump said at a news conference at the gathering. "He knows more about it than anybody I know." 
Nor is this the first time Hamm has been in the limelight of a presidential campaign. In 2012, he was an energy adviser to Republican Mitt Romney and contributed $985,000 to a pro-Romney super-PAC. 
Now Hamm is predicting a bright future for the oil sector and its workers if voters put Trump in the White House, and he even claims the recent stock market surge is a sign of what can happen with a Trump win. 
"We're seeing a rally of about 1,400 points. I refer to that as the Trump rally," Hamm said, referring to jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 27. "People are sensing that we're going to have a president who's going to be pro-jobs, pro-business." 
If all goes well for the duo, fall will bring an election win for Trump and more profitable returns for oil producers. 
"The fundamentals are in favor of higher prices. We suggested they would be higher by year end," Hamm said, citing increasing global demand for oil and declines in production, including production by Continental and other U.S. operators. 
Tuesday, West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil, closed at $44.61 per barrel, its lowest level since May. 
"I said it would be $60 by year end. I think that could be a conservative number," he said. "We'll have to wait and see."

Abstract 
Though Cramer insists he hasn't drawn any conclusions, his work on the legislation demonstrates that he suspects efforts by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to protect their market share in the face of the prolonged oil-price slump, including pumping oil at record-high levels, are anti-competitive and warrant some sort of response from the 
U.S. government. 

Full Text 
As is the case with most of his policy stands, Donald Trump has spoken only generally about how Washington should treat energy production in the USA, expressing strong support for the oil, natural gas and coal industries and promising to cut funding for what he sees as excessive regulation. 
This week in North Dakota, the presumptive Republican nominee for president may reveal more about his views on promoting domestic energy, and perhaps take another shot at Saudi Arabia, the leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
Trump is scheduled to deliver a keynote address Thursday at the Williston Basin Petroleum Conference in Bismarck to an audience of oil and gas operators whose drilling in the Bakken shale formation has made North Dakota the second-leading oil-producing state in the USA. 
Given the venue, it's no surprise that Trump is likely to offer another full-throated endorsement of the resurgence in U.S. oil and gas production that has resulted from hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in the shale formations of North Dakota, Texas and other states over the past 10 years. 
What's uncertain is what else he may have to offer producers, and whether he'll call for measures to protect them from actions taken by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members now that oil prices are in a two-year slump. 
One person who's counting on him to do so is Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a former state utility regulator, who has endorsed Trump and been enlisted as an informal energy adviser to the Trump campaign. 
Cramer, along with fellow Republican Trent Franks of Arizona and Democrat Collin Peterson of Minnesota, introduced legislation this year that would authorize a bipartisan commission to investigate OPEC for possible unfair trade practices. 
"He and I have not talked about his position on the bill that I (co-sponsored) or on the forming of a commission or OPEC's trading tactics, but we've all listened to him enough to know his America-first policy angle and emphasis, and it seems like it would fit with this," Cramer said outside an energy conference in Washington last week. 
"This is a way to make sure that now that we have access to global markets that our competitors are playing by the same rules, or at least fair rules," said Cramer, who supported a bill passed in 2015 that ended 40-year-old restrictions on U.S. oil exports. "We can't change the fact that you can produce oil in the desert much cheaper than you can in the shale, but we shouldn't put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage." 
Cramer, a climate change skeptic, provided the Trump campaign with several pages of general ideas on energy policy, including suggestions for reductions in environmental regulations and new tax provisions that would treat all forms of energy evenly. 
Though Cramer insists he hasn't drawn any conclusions, his work on the legislation demonstrates that he suspects efforts by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to protect their market share in the face of the prolonged oil-price slump, including pumping oil at record-high levels, are anti-competitive and warrant some sort of response from the 
U.S. government. 
The bill isn't clear as to what actions might be taken by Washington, other than to say they would include "policy reform in the areas of taxes, trade, defense, and research and development, and diplomacy, among others." 
Cramer said the mere introduction of the bill "sends an important message that you're not going to get by with collusion or monopoly tactics." 
He found a friendly audience for his proposal at the conference, which was held by Securing America's Energy Future, a group of business executives and retired military leaders who promote policies to strengthen U.S. energy security. 
The discussion over OPEC comes as tensions between Washington and Riyadh heighten. The Senate voted unanimously Tuesday to allow families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any involvement in the terrorist incidents. 
President Obama has threatened to veto the legislation. 
This year, Trump told The New York Times editorial board he would be willing to cut off oil purchases from Saudi Arabia if the kingdom didn't do more to support the war on the Islamic State. 
This week, Trump may offer more insight on what his "Make America Great Again" campaign means for world oil markets.

Abstract 
According to New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, no amount of regulation can safely guard against the dangers fracking poses to our land, water, air, natural resources and public health. 

Full Text 
A growing body of evidence tells us that fracking is a danger to our water supply -- our most precious resource. It's a danger to the air we breathe. It has resulted in more earthquakes. It's highly explosive. And it's contributing to climate change. 
The toxic chemicals used in fracking are known to cause lung cancer and birth defects. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Academy of Sciences have shown clear evidence that hydraulic fracturing can lead to a contaminated water supply. 
We cannot allow our children to be poisoned by toxic drinking water just so a handful of fossil fuel companies can make even more in profits. There is simply no good way to contain the cocktail of toxic chemicals pumped into the ground. 
Moreover, the threat of methane emissions from fracking presents a profound danger to our climate. Methane traps more than 84 times the heat of carbon dioxide. While natural gas might burn cleaner than coal, the enormous explosion of fracking and the resulting release of methane presents a significant danger to our planet. 
I'm proud that my state of Vermont has joined with New York to ban fracking. According to New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, no amount of regulation can safely guard against the dangers fracking poses to our land, water, air, natural resources and public health. 
If we are serious about safe and clean drinking water and clean air, if we are serious about protecting the health of our children and families, and if we are serious about combating climate change, we need to phase out fracking nationwide. 
Unfortunately, Secretary Hillary Clinton disagrees. Even worse, as secretary of State, she worked to export fracking throughout the world to reward companies such as Chevron, Halliburton, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. That, in my view, is unacceptable. 
The time has come to fundamentally transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and toward clean sources of power such as wind, solar and geothermal. And by doing this, not only will we create millions of new jobs, we also will save our planet in the process. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Climate activists' cry: 'Keep it in the ground': A push to limit extraction of fossil fuels gains traction

Abstract 
Critics of "keep it in the ground" say cutting back on drilling could cause energy prices to spike and would do nothing to limit demand for fossil fuels, which still generate two-thirds of the country's electricity. 

Full Text 
Nobody said a word as the auctioneer took his place at the lectern, but the tension was deafening. Nearly 100 protesters had packed the room at Utah's Salt Palace Convention Center, mad as hell that the federal government was about to sell oil and gas leases for as many as 45,000 public acres. 
"OK, let's start the sale, ladies and gentlemen who will give me an opening bid of $2 to start? Two-dollar bid?" 
The protesters hadn't planned to disrupt the auction. But once the bidding got underway, they couldn't help themselves. They started chanting: "People gonna rise like the water, gonna calm this crisis down. I hear the voice of my great-granddaughter, saying, 'Keep it in the ground!'" 
Eventually, a federal official asked Salt Lake City police to remove the activists from the room. As officers escorted them out, one of the protesters, Tim Ream, shouted at the bidders, "Show this to your grandkids! Show it to them and explain what's happening with the climate!" 
What's happening with the climate isn't complicated: For every ton of carbon that humanity emits by burning fossil fuels, the world is getting hotter. 
The protesters had a simple demand for President Obama: Stop making public lands and water available for oil and natural gas drilling. It's a message that's taking hold across the country. In recent months, "keep it in the ground" activists have protested federal auctions in Denver, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Reno and elsewhere. They've got supporters in Congress, including a presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. 
Any serious plan to deal with climate change, these activists say, requires the United States to start limiting the extraction of fossil fuels -- immediately. They point to studies showing that if the world doesn't keep between two-thirds and four-fifths of its coal, oil and gas in the ground, global warming will almost certainly exceed 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times, the target adopted by 195 nations in Paris last year. 
Scientists once believed that 2 degrees of warming would be relatively safe, but recent studies have found that even less warming could be catastrophic for people, animals and the natural systems that underpin human civilization. The world already has warmed by 1 degree, a change that is causing oceans to rise and extreme weather events to become more frequent and more intense. Climate change also is threatening water supplies and crop production, and causing infectious diseases to spread. 
"Nobody is saying we want to stop burning fossil fuels today, or that we have the ability to stop burning fossil fuels today," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "What we're saying is that the challenge of climate change is a severe one. The need to act has never been more urgent." 
Critics of "keep it in the ground" say cutting back on drilling could cause energy prices to spike and would do nothing to limit demand for fossil fuels, which still generate two-thirds of the country's electricity. They believe policymakers should limit their focus to reducing demand for coal, oil and gas, either by taxing carbon or by providing incentives for clean energy. "Keep it in the ground" supporters favor those steps but say they aren't enough. 
"If you don't address the demand side, the supply side won't come," said economist Frank Wolak, director of Stanford University's Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. "Everything we use, you name it, it has fossil fuels in it. That's the absurdity of this ('keep it in the ground') argument." 
Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., disagrees. He introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act, which would end new fossil fuel leases on public lands and offshore, in the House of Representatives earlier this year. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders co-sponsored a similar bill from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. 
Huffman said the United States already has more than enough oil and gas at its disposal to keep the lights on as the country transitions to clean energy. 
"There's simply no reason to continue to let these extractive industries call the shots on public resources," Huffman said. "These fossil fuel deposits are under our federal lands and off our shores -- they belong to the American people. They don't belong to Exxon or Shell."

Obama decides to nix new offshore drilling

Abstract 
Offshore drilling in the Atlantic had drawn vigorous support from the American Petroleum Institute, which represents companies in the industry, saying it would have bolstered jobs, tax revenue and economic development. 

Full Text 
The Obama administration will abandon its plan to allow new offshore oil drilling on the southeast coast of the USA, dealing a blow to petroleum companies and marking a 
victory for environmentalists, coastal residents and the U.S. military. 
The Interior Department said Tuesday it will not auction off drilling rights for Atlantic Ocean waters off the coast of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. 
The Obama administration opened the door to the possibility of allowing limited drilling in Arctic waters. 

The moves come amid declining industry investment in new exploration and production activities. 

The price of oil has fallen by about 70% since late 2014, making new investment less attractive. However, the industry continues to seek long-term investment opportunities 
under the assumption that oil prices will recover. 
Offshore drilling in the Atlantic had drawn vigorous support from the American Petroleum Institute, which represents companies in the industry, saying it would have bolstered 

jobs, tax revenue and economic development. 
"The decision appeases extremists," API CEO Jack Gerard said in a statement. "This is not how you harness America's economic and diplomatic potential." 
Governors in several Republican states, as well as Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, supported offshore drilling plans. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary 

Clinton and Bernie Sanders voiced opposition. 

The move is unlikely to be a serious limitation on industry growth, Notre Dame law professor Bruce Huber said. "Some will see a connection between today's switch and the administration's recent moratorium on federal coal leasing, and they are probably right," Huber said. Jacqueline Savitz with environmental group Oceana said the move will aid in the battle against climate change. "It will help promote the clean energy solutions that we so 
desperately need," she said.

Acidic oceans are stunting growth of coral reefs: A new study run outside the lab shows the damage done by carbon

Abstract 
Without significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the world's coral reefs may be gone by the end of the century, other studies have found. Since the start of the industrial revolution in the 1800s, the world's oceans have grown nearly 30% more acidic, according to a 2009 Scientific Committee on Oceanic Resources report. 

Full Text 
Ocean acidification caused by global warming is slowing growth of the world's coral reefs, a first-of-its-kind experiment found. 
Scientists altered ocean water in a coral reef near Australia to a level of acidity observed two centuries ago. The researchers found coral grew about 7% more in response to the more alkaline water from the 1800s compared with the more acidic water of today, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. 
"Our work provides the first strong evidence from experiments on a natural ecosystem that ocean acidification is already slowing coral reef growth," said study lead author Rebecca Albright of the Carnegie Institution for Science. Previous studies were completed in laboratories. 
Coral reefs have been declining for decades. Without significant cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the world's coral reefs may be gone by the end of the century, other studies have found. 
Since the start of the industrial revolution in the 1800s, the world's oceans have grown nearly 30% more acidic, according to a 2009 Scientific Committee on Oceanic Resources report. 
The process is driven by man-made climate change. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels ends up as excess carbonic acid that's absorbed by the ocean. The acidification affects coral, shellfish and other marine life. 
"Ocean acidification is already taking its toll on coral reef communities. This is no longer a fear for the future; it is the reality of today," Albright added. 
The agreement reached between world leaders in Paris last year to limit rising temperatures over the next several decades is a start toward combating ocean acidification but may not be enough, said study co-author Ken Caldeira, also of the Carnegie Institution. 
"Every little bit of emissions reduction helps coral reefs a little bit, but if we really want coral reefs to persist into the future, little bits of emission reduction will not be enough," he said. "Cuts in emissions must be deeper and come more rapidly." 
Richard Feely, a chemical oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle who was not involved in the study, said it is significant the research wasn't conducted in a laboratory. 
"You are actually seeing the response in the field" to the change from a more acidic to alkaline ocean water, he said.

Abstract 
"The U.S. solar power industry continues to grow and create jobs, providing further evidence that promoting economic growth and fighting climate change can go hand in hand," former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is also the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy for Cities and Climate Change, said in a statement announcing the study. 

Full Text 
While American workers flocking into the solar-energy industry help make it one of the fastest-growing sectors of our nation's economy, there are signs the "solar coaster" ride is far from over. 
Nationally, solar companies are adding workers nearly 12 times faster than the overall economy, and accounted for more than 1% of all jobs created in 2015, says a new report by the Solar Foundation, a pro-solar industry group. More than 208,000 Americans now work in the solar industry, a 20% increase in a single year, and up 123% since 2010, the report said. 
"The U.S. solar power industry continues to grow and create jobs, providing further evidence that promoting economic growth and fighting climate change can go hand in hand," former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is also the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy for Cities and Climate Change, said in a statement announcing the study. 
More workers have produced a lot more solar energy. In 2014, the United States installed as much solar power capacity every three weeks as it did in all of 2008. Utility customers and regulators are increasingly demanding that electricity come from clean sources like solar and wind. 
The industry's dependence on tax credits and incentives poses a risk, however: A decision by Nevada regulators to reduce the credits paid to homeowners who install solar panels this month prompted two major companies, SolarCity and Sunrun, to announce they're laying off about 750 workers. 
Coal is still king, just not when it comes to jobs. In December, the mining industry, including coal mining, lost about 8,000 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, with about 129,000 jobs lost over 2015. The BLS doesn't track solar jobs, instead deferring to the Solar Foundation for statistics. 
Coal, natural gas and nuclear remain the backbone of the nation's energy sector, providing the bulk of our "always-on" power. Solar power made with photovoltaic cells remains a small portion of the country's energy portfolio, accounting for about 1% percent of total generation. 
Solar installations come in many forms, from the small panels installed above streetlights in New Jersey to the backyard panels serving homes in Vermont or the cooperative solar "farms" built in the desert canyons of Colorado. Solar advocates say tax incentives and government mandates have been highly successful in prompting solar development. 
California, for instance, has set a goal of getting 33% of its electricity from renewables by 2020 and is on track with a separate effort to install nearly 2,000 megawatts' worth of solar panels on rooftops by the end of this year. President Obama has been a major driver of solar-energy jobs and last year announced plans to train 75,000 people, many of them veterans, to work in the solar sector. 
The boom-and-bust cycle of tax incentives, dating to the Carter and Reagan presidencies, has led to long-term inconsistency in the industry, said Frank Marshall, the director of policy for Asheville, N.C.-based FLS Energy, which builds large solar farms. 
"We often call it the solar coaster," Marshall said.

Abstract 
After 2016, the next president will need to defend, and follow through on, the two major steps Obama has set in motion: the tough fuel efficiency standard that will cut automotive carbon pollution 40% while delivering a new car fleet that averages 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025, and a 32% cut in power plant emissions.\n 

Full Text 
President Obama's crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and power plants made the U.S. a leader at the United Nations climate summit. 
Now, with the whole world watching and 2015 smashing high temperature records, he can give real meaning to the promise Paris offers without bumping into an intractable Congress. The president can accelerate and expand efforts to slash emissions of global warming pollutants by the natural gas and oil industries. He can improve refinery efficiency. He can 
issue tougher efficiency standards for energy-wasting home furnaces. And the government must begin to tackle industries such as cement manufacturing, which gets little public attention but spews vast amounts of carbon dioxide, the gas primarily responsible for climate change. 
Methane leaks 
Methane is the most plentiful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, after carbon dioxide. It is emitted in far smaller amounts and disappears sooner, but molecule for molecule it 
traps more than 25 times as much heat as CO2 over 100 years. 

The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that nearly 30% of U.S. methane emissions come from oil production and the production, transmission and distribution of 

natural gas. The agency is preparing standards that would limit methane leaks from new drilling sites and pipelines. 
But what about currently operating sites? They are likely responsible for roughly 90% of the oil and gas industries' methane emissions. The administration must set standards 
that would require industry to plug these leaks. 

The president used authority granted by Congress in the Clean Air Act to tackle pollution from cars and power plants. Using that same authority, the administration can crack 

down on oil refinery emissions -- one of the largestindustrial sources of greenhouse gases after power plants. 
Much electricity is wasted on inefficient appliances. Some consumers know to shop for those with an "energy star" efficiency rating. The government sets standards to prod 
manufacturers into making improvements -- for those shopping for homes they own and for renters whose appliances are supplied by landlords. 

Efficiency standards for dozens of appliances have been the subject of negotiations with foot-dragging industry. For example, according to Marianne DiMascio of the Appliance 
Standards Awareness Project, litigation and other resistance have stalled the adoption of meaningful new energy-saving rules for gas-fired home furnaces since 1987. 
This year, the Energy Department proposed requiring new units to convert 92% of their fuel's energy into heat, a significant improvement from the current 80% rate. 

Stuck in cement 
Manufacturing cement involves burning fossil fuels to heat raw materials to up to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, giving off roughly a ton of carbon dioxide for every ton of cement 
emerging from the kiln. 

We must work to cut these emissions and those from other energy-intensive industries such as metals production. 

To be sure, these measures lack the poetic appeal of solar panels and wind turbines that cleanly yield electricity from endlessly renewable resources -- themselves growing 
elements in the fight against global warming. Even so, using energy more efficiently is the key workhorse as we wring greenhouse gases from the economy. 
After 2016, the next president will need to defend, and follow through on, the two major steps Obama has set in motion: the tough fuel efficiency standard that will cut 

automotive carbon pollution 40% while delivering a new car fleet that averages 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025, and a 32% cut in power plant emissions. Automakers are already 

trying to weaken the new-car standards, and coal and utility forces have threatened to drown the Clean Power Plan in a flood of litigation. 
The refusal of so many Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress to even recognize the problems posed by global warming only underscores the need for 
Obama to do as much as possible in 2016. 

To turn the tide against the changing climate, he must act boldly and leverage our leadership as though the world depends on it. Because it does.

After four decades, good riddance to oil export ban

Abstract 
According to the Institute for Energy Research, it has not even had a major impact on gasoline prices. 

Full Text 
As part of the budget deal to keep the government running for another year, the 40-year-old ban on exporting U.S. crude oil is finally set to be lifted. 
It's about time. 
The ban, imposed in response to the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s, has long since outlived any usefulness it might have once had. More recently, it has done palpable harm to domestic producers. 
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for domestic oil, has been selling for several dollars less per barrel than oil on international markets, a difference that stems from the dearth of options for where it can be sent for refining. 
This has made it harder for domestic producers to turn a profit and attract investors, at a time when the global collapse in oil prices has eliminated approximately 100,000 jobs in America. Surely this was not what President Ford had in mind when he signed the ban in 1975, saying that the time had come to "put ourselves solidly on the road to energy independence." 
The ban has not made America more secure. According to the Institute for Energy Research, it has not even had a major impact on gasoline prices. What it has done is subsidize refiners, who benefit from a captive supply of oil to buy at bargain prices. 
In addition to being a case study in the law of unintended consequences, the ban provides two other important lessons for lawmakers. One is that they shouldn't enact laws out of emotion. They did so four decades ago when they responded to anger over gas station lines and the rising power of oil-rich Arab sheikdoms. They are in danger of doing so again today, out of the fear of terrorism and large-scale immigration. 
The other lesson is that, once in place, any law or regulation is extremely difficult to get rid of, even if the conditions present at its creation disappear. The Interstate Commerce Commission, for instance, was created to regulate the robber-baron railroad empires of the 1880s. It lived on until 1995, though no one could precisely articulate what it was for in its latter decades. 
Similarly, the export ban has endured at a time when it is out of place and contrary to U.S. interests. For the past several decades, policymakers and lawmakers of both parties have been obsessed with boosting exports as a way of reducing the trade deficit. And here they are with a ban on exports. 
Remaining defenders of the ban, many from labor and environmental groups, are simply against anything that helps oil producers. They are right to urge action on climate change. But this can be done only by putting a price on carbon pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, not by trying to halt fossil fuel production. 
The United States recently passed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the largest producer of oil and other liquid fuels. This is good for the U.S. economy, and the increased production of natural gas has helped the environment by displacing coal for electricity generation. 
In the final analysis, the best thing to say about the oil export ban is that it is reaching the end of the road.

Landmark climate accord doesn't end in Paris

Abstract 
Barring a technological miracle, global warming will continue unabated and wreak havoc on the planet. 

Full Text 
In today's fractious world, getting 195 nations to agree on anything, even whether the sun rises in the east, isn't easy. So, in many ways, the climate change deal that emerged from Paris over the weekend, a month after terrorist attacks traumatized the city, represents a remarkable achievement on behalf of humanity. 
But the things that made the Paris agreement so broadly acceptable to so many countries -- its voluntary nature, its lack of enforcement tools, and the many "requests" and "urges" throughout the 31-page text -- are the same things that threaten its effectiveness. 
Previous U.N.-sponsored efforts to create legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions ended in failure. So the Paris accord takes a pledge-drive approach: Each nation decides for itself how it plans to curb emissions, and by how much. Every five years, countries will be expected to submit stronger pledges. 
The pledges made so far aren't nearly enough to meet the Paris target of keeping the planet "well below" 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. So the agreement is less a solution than it is an effort to provide more structure and encouragement to the effort to control man-made climate change. 
In the best case scenario, the Paris accord will evolve like the competition between countries, and increasingly across regions, to sign new free trade agreements. Successive rounds of negotiations take on their own momentum and lead to more and more progress. 
In this scenario, countries will keep upping their pledges as new technologies emerge and renewable energy becomes more competitive. China, the world's top carbon emitter, will drastically reduce its burning of coal, which is choking its cities with smog. Peer pressure will prevent countries from cheating. Working together, the worlds' nations will stave off catastrophic warming. 
In the worst case scenario, countries will fail to meet their pledges, either by cheating or by recalibrating what they can afford. They will renege on financial commitments to help island countries survive rising sea levels. A glut of low-cost fossil fuel energy will stifle widespread adoption of greener technologies. Republicans in Washington will yank the U.S. out of the Paris accord, giving other nations an excuse to bail as well. Barring a technological miracle, global warming will continue unabated and wreak havoc on the planet. 
Which, if either, scenario prevails is yet to be determined. But, if nothing else, the Paris agreement -- hashed out during what's shaping up as the warmest year since modern record-keeping began -- sends a strong signal that the time for debating the basic science is past, and the time for mitigation and adaptation has arrived. 
As the agreement states, "Climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation by all countries." With so much at stake, the U.S. participation in negotiating the Paris agreement is only a first step. Selling the idea at home, and building consensus to follow through on America's commitments, will be the true test of the Obama administration's climate legacy.

The climate war is over: International policy shifts to how to make clean energy cheaper

Abstract 
[...]a treaty was taken off the table before the Paris summit even began. 

Full Text 
Monday's announcement by Bill Gates, the Obama administration and dozens of billionaires and governments that they'd double the amount they invest in developing clean energy technologies was heralded as a positive start to the U.N. climate summit. 
But it was in fact much more: The announcement signaled the end to the climate war that raged over the past 20 years. 
The reason is easy to understand. All the climate actions that Republicans, as well as British and Australian conservatives and skeptics, once feared -- a United Nations treaty, a 
national cap-and-trade regulatory regime or a carbon tax -- are politically dead in the water. 

Though diplomats and environmental journalists justify their participation in the Paris summit by suggesting there could be a treaty, it has been obvious since the last global climate meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 that none of the biggest emitters -- the U.S., China, India -- would allow the U.N. to dictate its energy futures. In fact, a treaty was taken off the table before the Paris summit even began. 
Fracking revolution 
There is another, related reason why the climate war is dead: Carbon emissions have peaked and are going down in many rich nations. U.S. emissions from electricity production declined 15% between 2007 and 2013 -- a huge shift in a slow-moving sector. The main reason is the abundance of cheap natural gas from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, itself the result of a 35-year effort by the U.S. Department of Energy and oil and 
gas companies in Texas, from the early 1970s to 2005. 
How fast emissions peak and decline depends on how quickly developing nations such as China and India can move to cleaner energy technologies, from fracking for natural gas to solar to nuclear. The Gates-Obama technology announcement signaled that the whole framework for dealing with climate change has shifted from making fossil fuels more expensive to making 
clean energy cheap. One of the main inspirations for their effort is the fracking revolution. 
To be sure, conservatives oppose spending tens of billions of dollars subsidizing green energy, as Obama did through his 2009 economic stimulus. 
But conservatives have long supported government funding basic research, which includes promising new technologies. 
And there is a precedent for Republicans and Democrats working together to increase funding for basic science. In 1998, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich worked with 

President Clinton to increase the budget for the National Institutes of Health from nearly $14 billion in 1998 to almost $30 billion in 2003. That's about the same amount many energy experts say we should be spending on energy research (currently, we spend about $5 billion). 
Innovation, cooperation 
My colleagues and I did an extensive history of the fracking revolution, interviewing former government and private sector players. All said the key was that the government 
funded many experiments, from geothermal and solar to nuclear to oil and gas. 

Most research investments fail, but the few that pay off, pay off big: The shale revolution contributes $190 billion to $330 billion every year to the U.S. economy in the form of 

cheaper energy prices. 
As such, increased energy innovation funding is a good thing for the economy and national security. It reduces our dependence on foreign imported oil, and it curbs air pollution 
and other environmental impacts. 

Just a few years ago, this might have led rich countries to hector the Indians and the Chinese over their refusal to agree to binding emission limits. But India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, successfully made his case for India's right to develop by burning cheap coal while also pledging to install a lot of solar panels -- both of which mollified mainstream environmentalists. 
Even if U.S. carbon emissions were to flatten, or modestly rise, future governments are more likely to implement modest regulations through the Environmental Protection Agency than pass a complicated new regulatory policy, global treaty or tax. 
To be sure, extremes on both sides will continue to argue over the accuracy of temperature readings, the Antarctic ice melt and whether heat waves are getting worse. But without any significant policy implication, the public and the news media will lose interest, and the climate war will go out like a fire untended. 
What will emerge in its place is a new climate policy pragmatism, one that acknowledges global warming as a gradual, long-term challenge -- best dealt with through technological innovation and cooperation so we can all move to cleaner sources of energy, faster.

Abstract 
150 of them were in Le Bourget on Monday, a record outside the U.N. Assembly in New York -- to try to forge a global plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the "deniers" were hardly a majority. 

Full Text 
President Obama, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. But they don't differ on this: Humankind is warming the planet, and we need to do something about it. 
As for climate scientists, it's not too much to say that virtually all of them are on board with the idea that man-made fossil fuels caused by burning coal, oil and gas are heating planet Earth. 
It wasn't ever thus, this overwhelming feeling that those who would deny man's influence on rising temperatures are simply wrong and not part of the conversation, whether in the negotiating rooms at Le Bourget, where United Nations climate talks are taking place through Dec. 11, or the wider debate around the world. 
In Copenhagen in 2009, the last time world leaders congregated on this scale -- 150 of them were in Le Bourget on Monday, a record outside the U.N. Assembly in New York -­to try to forge a global plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the "deniers" were hardly a majority. They were on the margins. But they still loomed large over the proceedings in a way that filtered down to how the event was portrayed by the international news media, myself included. 
I recall making the journalistic effort to inject "balance" into the stories I wrote by pointedly stating that there were individuals and groups that disputed the human contribution to climate change. They were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but the dissent seemed to deserve some recognition in the interest of journalistic balance. 
About a month before the summit in Copenhagen, the Climate Research Unit email controversy, or inevitably "Climategate," concentrated the minds of these dissenters. 
A cadre of deniers had hacked into a database belonging to Britain's University of East Anglia and claimed to have uncovered evidence showing that some scientists made up data to prove global warming existed. That evidence never fully materialized, but the alleged revelation cast a mini-shadow over those talks, at least in the public imagination. 
It's early days for the two-week conference in Paris, but it seems obvious that six years and a lot of hand-wringing later, climate change skepticism has been further relegated to the shadows. The evidence, scientists agree, is that clear. 
Unless, of course, you are one of the leading contenders for the Republican Party's nomination to be the next president of the United States. "I consider it to be not a big problem at all," front-runner Donald Trump has said. Ben Carson, another top candidate, has said, "There is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are man-caused and not naturally caused." 
Still, this time around, I have yet to notice the balancing qualifiers so prevalent in the climate coverage of the past. Balance is not balance if it's simply wrong. It's faux balance. 
The global scientific community says human-fueled climate change exists. The world's governments say it exists. The case seems clear, and decisive. 
Although not to everyone. One group is showcasing its global warming doubting wares in Le Bourget's exhibition halls. The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, or CFACT, will debut this week in Paris a documentary called Climate Hustle, billed (by CFACT) as the most important take on climate change since Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. David Rothbard, the film's executive producer, also the president of the organization, says in a news release that the documentary "debunks the (global warming) scare and clears the way for a return to sound science and rational debate." 
In the face of near unanimity from scientists and world leaders, his is a lonely crusade.

Abstract 
Left unchecked, computer simulations predict global warming will cripple the planet, leading to extreme weather, rising sea levels, worse air quality, threats to many plant and animal species and more human conflicts over scarcer resources. 

Full Text 
After years of conflict and inaction, 196 nations hope to finally reach agreement on a plan to combat global warming when they convene outside Paris on Monday for 12 days of negotiations. 
The United Nations-sponsored meeting will bring together 50,000 people and many world leaders -- including President Obama -- business chiefs, scientists and representatives from environmental groups, many expressing optimism that a consensus is close at hand. 
"The divisions that existed in previous talks have gone away," said Jeff Nesbit, executive director of Climate Nexus, an environmental group. The difference this time is that 177 of the participating nations are coming with national commitments for reducing emissions blamed for causing the planet to warm. 
On Thursday, Pope Francis, speaking in Africa, warned that it would be "catastrophic" if world leaders let special interest groups get in the way of a global agreement to curb fossil fuel emissions. Francis spoke to the U.N.'s regional office in Kenya after celebrating his first public Mass on the continent. 
"It would be sad, and dare I say even catastrophic, were special interests to prevail over the common good and lead to manipulating information in order to protect their own plans and interests," Francis said, according to a transcript from the Vatican. 
The pope said he hoped the Paris talks would approve a "transformational" agreement to fight poverty and protect the environment by developing a new energy system that depends on minimal fossil fuel use. 
Six years ago, climate talks in Copenhagen stumbled over disagreements between developed countries responsible for the most past emissions and developing nations whose expanding economies rely heavily on fossil fuels. The main argument: which countries should be required to take the boldest steps to reduce greenhouse gas. That conference ended with a weak agreement that "recognized" the need to contain temperature rises but no legally binding treaty. 
Despite the new optimism this time, success is far from guaranteed. Unanimous agreement is required for an accord, which aims to prevent greenhouse gases from warming Earth above 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, from pre-industrial levels by 2020. That is the minimum level climate scientists say is needed to prevent cataclysmic consequences to life on the planet. 
Among the issues to be thrashed out are whether the plans by high-polluting countries go far enough to meet the 2-degree target, and whether the U.N. deal should be binding on nations or merely serve as a guideline. 
Left unchecked, computer simulations predict global warming will cripple the planet, leading to extreme weather, rising sea levels, worse air quality, threats to many plant and animal species and more human conflicts over scarcer resources. 
"The impacts of climate change are happening faster and more intensively than scientists had expected," said Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute, a research organization focused on the environment." 
Jake Thompson, of the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental protection and action group, said that "14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred in this century." 
Global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas that power the world. The burning emits greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that have warmed Earth's atmosphere over the past 150 years to temperatures that cannot be explained by natural variability, according to numerous scientific studies.

Abstract 
Peabody Energy reached the settlement after a two-year investigation found the St. Louis-based company's public statements about the potential economic impact of climate change didn't always square with the firm's internal financial projections, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Monday. 

Full Text 
The world's largest publicly-traded coal company has agreed to make fuller public disclosures about the risks climate change poses to its business in a settlement of charges that it misled investors and the public. 
Peabody Energy reached the settlement after a two-year investigation found the St. Louis-based company's public statements about the potential economic impact of climate change didn't always square with the firm's internal financial projections, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Monday. 
Peabody shares closed up 3.43% at $15.09. The coal giant's stock has lost more than 87% of its value since a Feb. 25 high of $118.95-a-share amid a global plunge in energy prices. The agreement comes four days after Schneiderman opened a similar investigation of Exxon Mobil. 
Peabody has agreed to file revised Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures affirming that "concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities," said Schneiderman, who characterized the agreement as the first of its kind. 
"As a publicly traded company whose core business generates massive amounts of carbon emissions, Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with its investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, now and in the future," Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the agreement. "I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet." 
The coal giant in a statement stressed that "there is no other action associated with this settlement, no admission or denial of wrongdoing and no financial penalty." Peabody also said "the company has always sought to make appropriate disclosures." 
However, Peabody's past SEC filings regularly denied the company had the ability to predict the impact that potential regulation of climate change pollution would have on the firm's operations. The investigation found that Peabody and its consultants in fact "made projections that such regulation would have severe impacts on the company," Schneiderman's office said. 
Additionally, Peabody's SEC filings and other public communications "provided incomplete and one-sided discussions" of the International Energy Agency's projections related to future world coal demand, the investigation showed.

Fracking defeated Keystone XL: Environmentalists will find that it's a Pyrrhic victory for them

Abstract 
[...]without the surge in domestic natural gas production, the Obama administration's controversial Clean Power Plan would be essentially impossible to implement. 

Full Text 
Environmentalists are correct in calling President Obama's decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline a "symbolic" victory, but that description is too generous. For them, it's a Pyrrhic victory of the first order because the main factor behind Obama's decision is something environmentalists hate even more than Keystone: hydraulic fracturing. 
But for the gusher of new oil -- and the resulting drop in gasoline prices -- brought about by the fracking revolution, the political cost of stopping Keystone would have been prohibitive. And while environmentalists are loath to admit it, by unlocking a vast supply of natural gas from shale deposits, fracking is also playing a key role in helping reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
Numbers tell the story 
Since 2006, the U.S. has added 3.6 million barrels per day of new oil production. That's roughly equal to the combined output of two Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries: Kuwait and Ecuador. That surge in crude production has driven global oil prices down from more than $100 per barrel in 2014 to about $45 per barrel today. 
While 350.org, Sierra Club and other groups were protesting Keystone, domestic firms were building new pipelines to handle the surge in crude production. Since 2010, the U.S. has added about 12,000 miles of new oil pipelines. That's more than 10 times the length of the contested section of Keystone XL, which was to span 875 miles. 
Blocking Keystone hasn't prevented Canadian oil from coming into the USA. When the pipeline was proposed in 2008, the U.S. was importing 2.5 million barrels of oil a day from Canada. By August of this year, it was 3.9 million barrels per day. In other words, just the increase in Canadian oil amounts to more than 1.5 times the capacity of Keystone XL, which was designed to carry 830,000 barrels a day. 
Economics, not politics, will decide the fate of Canada's tar sands. Energy analysts at Wood MacKenzie recently estimated that $200 billion in oil and gas investments in 45 projects around the world were being delayed due to low prices. About $60 billion of those planned investments were slated for oil sands projects. Just last month, Royal Dutch Shell announced it was halting its Carmon Creek oil sands project in Alberta due to low oil prices. 
Our new ability to extract hydrocarbons from shale has also been a net win in the effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions. In August, U.S. natural gas production hit nearly 91 billion cubic feet per day. That's an increase of about 27 billion cubic feet a day since August 2006. It's roughly equal to the combined gas output of three OPEC members: Algeria, Iran and Venezuela. 
Innovation is key 
The surge in domestic production of low-cost natural gas is displacing coal in electricity generation, with the result that coal (which emits about twice as much carbon dioxide as gas during combustion) now provides 30% of domestic electricity, down from 44% five years ago. 
In fact, without the surge in domestic natural gas production, the Obama administration's controversial Clean Power Plan would be essentially impossible to implement. 
The lesson for climate change is obvious: Innovation is the key to moving from dirtier fuels to cleaner ones. Some environmentalists despair that this means there's nothing governments can do on climate. But the truth is that the federal government helped create the fracking revolution. Forty years of Department of Energy funding and research and development, as well as favorable tax policies (such as the depletion allowance and the deduction for intangible drilling costs) helped set the stage. 
If we want to keep oil (and coal) in the ground, we need to make other forms of energy cheaper. That means nurturing technologies such as natural gas extraction. It also means promoting another technology that environmentalists love to hate: nuclear energy. 
America has, as Obama said last week, established itself as the global leader in cutting carbon dioxide emissions. And that leadership is due to fracking and other technologies that have made clean-burning natural gas cheaper. As global leaders prepare to meet in Paris for the latest round of climate talks, their focus should be on spreading the fracking revolution. Their goal should not be making energy more expensive. Instead, it should be making cleaner energy cheaper.

Abstract 
The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes. 

Full Text 
ExxonMobil is under investigation by New York's top law enforcement officer about whether it lied to investors and the public about the risks and financial impact of climate change. 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the firm Wednesday, seeking financial records, statements and other climate-change-related material dating to 1977, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter. The official discussed the issue on condition of anonymity because the subpoena and other details of the investigation remain secret. 
"Exxon Mobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders," ExxonMobil said in response to questions about the subpoena, which was first reported by The New York Times. 
The company's 10-K annual report for the 2014 fiscal year stated many countries are considering regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions "due to concern over the risk of climate change." 
"These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas" it warned, adding that new rules "may also increase our compliance costs." 
The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes. 
New York's Martin Act gives the state's attorney general broad authority to investigate suspected financial wrongdoing and how it could affect investors. 
Material sought by the subpoena includes research reports showing potential causes of climate change and documents detailing how the company made business decisions and financial projections based on environmental projections, according to the official. Additionally, the subpoena seeks information about ExxonMobil's funding of organizations involved in climate-change research, including those that challenged climate science findings. Schneiderman's office also sought promotional materials, advertisements and flyers, as well as the firm's disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other statements to investors. 
Investigators plan to examine whether ExxonMobil's internal research and findings square with what the company told investors and the public. 
The energy giant is the second major company under investigation by Schneiderman over climate-change statements. Peabody Energy the world's largest private-sector coal producer, turned over documents in response to a 2013 request, and disclosed the issue the following year, the official said. 
"Peabody continues to work with the New York Attorney General's office regarding our disclosures, which have evolved over the years," spokesman Vic Svecsaid in a statement the firm issued Thursday.

Excuses for inaction on climate change melt away

Abstract 
[...]2015 is on track to eclipse 2014 as the warmest year on record. 

Full Text 
With every passing month, the arguments for inaction on climate change are melting away faster than glaciers in Alaska. Let's take them one at a time. 
Argument No. 1: The science is uncertain. Actually, it's not. An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activity is warming the planet. In fact, 2015 is on track to eclipse 2014 as the warmest year on record. This past summer was the hottest in recorded history, topping 2014 and even 1998, which featured an El Nino-driven spike that has allowed skeptics to claim, misleadingly, that temperatures haven't increased much since then. 
Now, the previous peaks are being surpassed, mountain snows are disappearing, ice sheets are crumbling and sea levels are rising. Studies conclude that the increased heat is exacerbating extreme weather events, such as the severe drought in California and flooding in the eastern USA. 
Argument No. 2: Other countries aren't doing anything about their greenhouse gas emissions, so the U.S. shouldn't bother. This assertion once held a kernel of truth, but it doesn't any more. Ahead of international climate talks in Paris at the end of next month, China, the European Union, Brazil and India have made new pledges to address global warming. 
Of these, China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is the most important. Driven as much by short-term concerns about choking urban pollution as by long-term concerns about the planet, the Chinese have pledged to implement a carbon-trading plan in 2017 and have their emissions peak by about 2030. 
This creates the ironic situation in which the communist Chinese are adopting a market-based approach to curb carbon emissions, while the Obama administration -- faced with an intransigent Republican-controlled Congress -- has to pursue top-down strategies that rely on government mandates. 
Argument No. 3: Efforts to control emissions will tank the economy. The "do nothing" crowd focuses on how efforts to limit carbon emissions will raise electric rates. In areas that rely primarily on coal-burning power plants, that could well happen. But coal is already being displaced by cheaper, cleaner natural gas. And the critics ignore the costs, such as higher charges for air conditioning and storm damage, of inaction. 
Annual insurance losses from extreme weather events, adjusted for inflation, have increased from about $10 billion in the 1980s to about $50 billion in the past decade. Lloyd's of London estimates that rising sea levels increased losses from Superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone. No wonder so many businesses, outside the fossil fuel industry, are taking climate change seriously. 
To the extent there's good news, it's that the world is starting to respond with the sort of urgency the threat requires. Pope Francis has added an important moral dimension to the climate debate. Renewable energy sources, particularly solar, are becoming more competitive. 
Whether all this will be enough to prevent catastrophic warming and disruption remains uncertain. What is certain, however, is that the case for denial and delay is growing weaker all the time.

Abstract 
A more fruitful approach on climate change would be to take concrete steps to reduce carbon emissions while looking for creative ways to engage the public and the world on the need for more aggressive action. 

Full Text 
It's not often that a president spends three days visiting a single state, particularly one with just 737,000 people and no real drama in how it will vote (reliably Republican) on Election Day. 
But President Obama seemingly can't get enough of Alaska. By the time he finishes his visit Wednesday, he will have been to Anchorage, Dillingham, Kotzebue and the Kenai Peninsula. He will have spoken with political leaders, native Alaskans and fishermen; taken a boat tour; hiked along a glacier; and taped an episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls. 
All this attention to the state known as the Last Frontier is the result of its shrinking glaciers, receding shorelines and melting permafrost. 
More than any other place in America, Alaska presents vivid examples of climate change. And Obama is using them to make his case that people and nations need to act swiftly to protect Alaska and the rest of the globe from ruinous warming. 
Yet during his Alaskan odyssey, Obama has taken flak from an unlikely source: environmentalists. They argue that pushing for climate action, shortly after approving Royal Dutch Shell's plan for drilling in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, makes him a hypocrite. 
Actually, it doesn't. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with fighting to mitigate climate change while also recognizing that oil remains an important energy source for the time being. 
The appropriate and practical way to combat climate change is not to unilaterally restrict oil production, and most certainly not to restrict oil from a specific location. Rather, it is to impose limits or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions and then let markets, consumers and states decide how to respond. 
To this end, Obama has already taken some promising first steps. He has announced efficiency standards for vehicles that will significantly reduce both fuel consumption and carbon emissions. His administration is working on similar standards for airplanes. And just last month, he announced tough new limits on power plant emissions. 
These actions, along with a natural gas boom that is displacing coal, are helping the United States show progress and leadership ahead of global climate talks in Paris later this year. 
In contrast, prohibiting Shell from drilling off the Alaska coast would accomplish little, at least from a climate change perspective. It would not stop people from consuming oil. It would not cause them to buy more efficient vehicles or bike to work, or take public transportation. 
All a drilling ban would do is ensure that oil that would have come from Alaska comes from somewhere else, perhaps from unfriendly nations in the Middle East. 
A more fruitful approach on climate change would be to take concrete steps to reduce carbon emissions while looking for creative ways to engage the public and the world on the need for more aggressive action. 
Might we suggest a three-day trip to Alaska?

Study: Risk of large wildfires rises

Abstract 
Scientists in the study used computer models to simulate future climate conditions, based on projections of greenhouse gas emissions from the continued burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. 

Full Text 
This year's catastrophic wildfire season -- more than 7.6 million acres already burned -- could be just a glimpse at what the future holds. 
The risk of so-called "very large wildfires" could increase as much as six times in the U.S. by mid-century as a result of man-made global warming, researchers concluded in a 
study announced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Wednesday. 
"Very large fires" are defined as the top 10% of fires based on acreage. Such blazes account for the majority of burned acres across the U.S. each year. There are currently 66 

large fires burning, a step down from "very large." 

Climate change is expected to both intensify fire-friendly weather conditions -- such as heat and drought -- and lengthen the season during which these fires tend to spread, 
according to the study, which was published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire. 
Huge sections of the Western U.S. would see the risk of very large fires increase by as much as 200% to 500%. 
The highest risk area includes the Great Basin and Northern Rockies, as well as the Sierra Nevada and Northern California. 
Scientists in the study used computer models to simulate future climate conditions, based on projections of greenhouse gas emissions from the continued burning of fossil fuels 

such as coal, oil and gas. 

Over the past couple of decades, wildfires have charred more and more of the U.S. Nine of the 10 years with the largest number of acres burned on record have occurred since 
2000, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. 
Several states, including Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Oregon have all seen their largest or most destructive wildfires on record in this decade alone. 
A separate study out Wednesday from NASA and several universities showcased global warming's opposite concern: an increased risk of coastal flooding because of a higher 

than predicted sea-level rise by 2100. 
The higher sea levels will lead to flooding of coastal cities around the world.

Abstract 
Inspired by Norquist's success, other interest groups are trying to get into the pledge game, on issues ranging from gay marriage to global warming. 

Full Text 
You've got to hand it to Grover Norquist. He has been remarkably successful at persuading Republican officeholders and candidates to sign his no-tax-increases-ever pledge, which has made him influential in Washington and a key reason why so little has been done to solve the nation's most vexing financial problems. 
Goaded by Norquist, president of the group Americans for Tax Reform, conservatives' traditional resistance to tax increases has morphed into a quasi-religious, party-defining obsession. The pledge has helped kill any number of reasonable bipartisan plans for controlling the national debt or fixing lesser problems, such as replenishing the nearly bankrupt Highway Trust Fund. 
Any doubt about the power of the pledge vanished four years ago in a Fox News debate, when eight candidates for the Republican presidential nomination were asked whether they'd reject a budget deal with $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new taxes -- a fantastically good deal for conservatives. Every hand went up. 
Now another presidential campaign is upon us, and candidates continue to be under pressure to sign Norquist's pledge. Most of the 17 Republican contenders have signed or indicated they will, except for former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former New York governor George Pataki and businessman Donald Trump. 
Good for them. Bush, in particular, has been refreshingly contemptuous of the idea. At a congressional hearing three years ago, he said he was a consistent tax cutter but not a pledge signer. "I don't believe you outsource your principles or convictions," Bush said. 
The issue cuts close to home for Bush because his father was hurt by the infamous "read my lips, no new taxes" promise he made at the 1988 Republican convention. The elder Bush reversed himself in a 1990 budget deal with the Democratic Congress that helped cost him re-election in 1992. But the budget agreement, combined with subsequent efforts, paved the way for the only four years of balanced budgets (1998-2001) of the past 45 years. 
Inspired by Norquist's success, other interest groups are trying to get into the pledge game, on issues ranging from gay marriage to global warming. 
The billionaire Koch brothers' political arm, Americans for Prosperity, is insisting candidates sign a promise not to support any climate tax that raises net revenue. Signatories include Republicans Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul. 
On the opposite side of the climate change debate, The Nation magazine wants candidates to sign a pledge never to take money from oil, gas or coal companies. So far, only Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Democrats Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley have fallen into line. 
At least refusing to take fossil-fuel money wouldn't restrict their actions in office. Even so, what most pledges have in common is that they make candidates beholden to interest groups and, once in office, limit their ability to deal with changing circumstances. Compromise is what democracy is all about, especially in a politically divided nation. Candidates who vow never to make a deal, even one that might be in the nation's best interest, are pledging allegiance to the wrong people.

FACEBOOK President Obama announced clean power standards this week that would require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions for electric power plants to begin by 2022. Some people don't seem to care that China and India will be building coal-fired power plants like crazy. Those emissions will dwarf the slight decrease in U.S. emissions at a 
huge cost to consumers. Bill Johnson President Obama's plan is an important step that will provide a focus for U.S. leadership at the international meeting in Paris. As a scientist, I agree with his statement that we 
are the first generation to experience climate change and the last generation with a chance of stopping it. Bill DeMott Why not accept that climate change is real, and clean energy needs to be respected as a solution? Continuing to equate the issue to a cost level is hardly relevant when the 
resulting doom of future citizens is imminent. If one could avoid a terminal disease by changing his or her lifestyle and incur additional expense, would that be a sensible alternative to dying? Big business can surely afford to provide clean air. Politicians claim their concern is for constituents, but their allegiance is to donors who put them in office. John Thomas Burning coal for energy at anywhere near the current rate causes health problems and environmental degradation. Just the facts. Phillip Noe 
LETTERS 
As President Obama promised in his first presidential campaign, he is marching non-stop down the road to fulfilling his legacy at any cost, waving the flag of global-warming 
alarmism, while he continues fundamentally transforming America. Certainly, coupled with nationalizing health care and over-regulating Wall Street and the finance industry, 
Obama's abuse of power seems limitless. 

Worse, the president's feckless foreign policy has allowed Russia's aggression to escalate, terror machines to spread throughout the Middle East and the world, and Iran's state-
sponsored terrorism to move toward nuclear weapons, the destruction of Israel and attacks against America and the West. 
Hope is not lost if American voters rise up, reject the liberal views infecting our country, and take back government in the next election.

Abstract 
According to the White House, the coal plan will reduce premature deaths related to power plant emissions by nearly 90% in 2030, preventing 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks in children and 300,000 fewer missed school and work days. 

Full Text 
Health groups on Monday praised President Obama's plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. 
The new Clean Power Plan -- certain to be challenged in the courts and in the Republican Congress -- will require power plants to reduce carbon emissions by 32% from 2005 levels through 2030. According to the White House, the coal plan will reduce premature deaths related to power plant emissions by nearly 90% in 2030, preventing 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 
asthma attacks in children and 300,000 fewer missed school and work days. 
Almost one in five kids suffer from asthma, said Harold Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association. 
Air pollution and extreme weather events increase instances of asthma, injury and cardiovascular disease -- putting children, the elderly and those with chronic health 

conditions at greatest risk, said physician Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. 

Neurologist Alan Lockwood, a senior scientist with the advocacy group Physicians for Social Responsibility, estimated that coal-fired power plants are linked to 50,000 deaths a 
year in the USA and that coal contributes to four of the five leading causes of death -- heart disease, cancer, stroke and chronic respiratory disease. 
Though other energy sources pose health risks, "in terms of health effects, coal is by far the worst," Lockwood said. 
Critics say there is no evidence the plan will reduce asthma. 
"It is shameful that the administration and its allies feel compelled to use misleading language to attempt to build support for its legally questionable power plan which is about 

reducing carbon, not reducing asthma," said Laura Sheehan, American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity spokeswoman. 

"Sadly, this rhetoric is nothing more than a red herring designed to hide the fact that carbon rule will not do anything to improve climate change but will result in higher electricity bills that few can afford," she said. "With higher energy bills come tough choices about whether to keep the lights on or take needed medications." Credit: Liz Szabo, USA TODAY

Abstract 
The Environmental Protection Agency gives every state a target for reducing emissions from its electric power plants. [...]focusing strictly on electric bills overlooks the high costs of extreme weather events -- drought-driven wildfires, excessive rainfall -- that scientists say are exacerbated by global warming. 

Full Text 
If carbon dioxide emissions were purple and pungent, instead of colorless and odorless, the clean-power standards President Obama announced Monday wouldn't be necessary. Public outcry over the smelly purple haze would have long ago prompted Congress to put a price on carbon pollution and make alternative energy sources far more competitive. 
But the 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide that America pumps into the atmosphere each year are invisible, and the effects of climate change are gradual. That has helped fossil-fuel interests thwart sensible, market-based efforts -- such as a carbon tax that would be rebated to consumers -- to reduce the heat-trapping emissions. 
In the face of congressional gridlock, Obama's plan, the final version of a proposal he first made in June 2014, represents the next best way to change the energy mix at home and show U.S. seriousness ahead of global climate talks later this year. 
For all the complexity of the new rules, the basic plan is straightforward. The Environmental Protection Agency gives every state a target for reducing emissions from its electric power plants. Each state has a variety of options for reaching its goal. States will have until 2016 to submit initial plans and until 2022 to start cutting, two years later than in the original proposal. If the plan survives legal and political assaults -- a big if -- carbon-dioxide emissions from existing power plants will be 32% lower in 2030 than they were in 2005. 
Will all this solve the climate change problem? No. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but they represent only 32% of the total. So the administration's plan would take care of about one-third of one-third -- or about one-ninth -- of domestic emissions. And unless other major emitting nations such as China follow suit, the U.S. reductions will be swamped by increases elsewhere. 
Even so, the Clean Power Plan is an important piece of a larger climate strategy, and well worth doing. It will improve public health by reducing soot from coal-burning plants. It will boost renewables such as solar and wind power. Most significant, it will give the U.S. more leverage in the upcoming international negotiations. The U.S., the world's second-largest carbon emitter after China, can hardly expect other nations to curb emissions if it is unwilling to do so itself. 
The longer the world waits to act, the greater the risk of irreversible damage. As Obama put it Monday, "There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change." 
Opponents of the plan trotted out the usual dire warnings about rising electric bills and economic ruin, particularly in the states most dependent on coal-burning plants. But the history of environmental regulations has been that markets adjust and industry's claims of doom turn out to be overstated. And focusing strictly on electric bills overlooks the high costs of extreme weather events -- drought-driven wildfires, excessive rainfall -- that scientists say are exacerbated by global warming. 
Those are the visible manifestations of the hidden buildup of greenhouse gases. In other words, what you can't see can hurt you.

In praising the president's plan, Hillary Clinton -- front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 -- said it "drives investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, reduces asthma attacks and premature deaths and promotes a healthier environment and a stronger economy." 

Full Text 
Combating climate change will protect the nation's economy, security and health, President Obama said Monday in unveiling a plan designed to reduce power plant emissions 
and fated to be a major 2016 campaign issue. 
"This is our moment to get this right and leave something better for our kids," he said about his "Clean Power Plan." A major plank in Obama's overall climate change agenda, 
the plan immediately became a fault line in the emerging fight to succeed him as president. 

Democratic presidential candidates praised the plan as a good way to confront the challenges of climate challenge; Republicans cast it as over-regulation that will reduce jobs and inflate utility bills and vowed to change it if elected. 
"There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change," Obama said, blaming it for stronger storms, deeper droughts and longer-lasting wildfire seasons. 
Levels of carbon dioxide are at their highest in 800,000 years, Obama said, causing more cases of asthma and other diseases -- especially among children -- and threatening 
national security. There are restrictions on other toxic chemicals, Obama said, but "there have never been federal limits on the amount of carbon that power plants can dump 
into the air." 

Though Obama laid out a stark vision of what could happen if no actions are taken, the next president will have a say on how -- and if -- Obama's proposed emission reductions 

are enforced. 
New requirements -- including the major one that carbon emissions be reduced 32% by the year 2030, relative to 2005 levels -- kick in after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20, 
2017. 

The Clean Power Plan will be the subject of lawsuits from energy interests who say the government is exceeding its authority with a "war on coal." 

In praising the president's plan, Hillary Clinton -- front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 -- said it "drives investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, 
reduces asthma attacks and premature deaths and promotes a healthier environment and a stronger economy." 
It is a "floor, not the ceiling," Clinton said, vowing to go further with pollution restrictions and other climate change projects if she is elected. 
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also seeking the Democratic nomination, said the plan sounds "like a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuel, and I support that 

effort." 
Republican presidential candidates took a different tack. 
"The rule runs over state governments, will throw countless people out of work and increases everyone's energy prices," said former Florida governor Jeb Bush. 
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Obama should call his project the "Costly Power Plan," saying "it will cost hardworking Americans jobs and raise their energy rates." Walker, 

like other GOP candidates, vowed to stop it if elected. 

Congressional Republicans also criticized the plan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., noted that GOP lawmakers are moving to block the new regulations. Rather than work with Congress on "energy diversification, this White House seems to want good politics, not good policy," McConnell said.

Billionaire Charles Koch on Sunday invoked the American Revolution, the fight to end slavery and the civil-rights movement as he exhorted the donors in his growing political 
policy empire to help him dismantle what he called the obstacles to a "truly free society." 
"All of these movements struck a moral chord with the American people. They all sought to overcome an injustice," Koch said to a ballroom of hundreds of donors gathered for 
his network's annual summer seminar. "We, too, are seeking to right injustices that are holding our country back." 

He also painted a bleak picture of the state of the nation and laid out what he saw as the stakes for their efforts. 

"If we can just change the trajectory of this country from where it is headed -- one of control, dependency, hopelessness and poverty -- to one that moves toward this free 
society, the innovation, the improvement in the standard of living, the helping of the poor uplift themselves will be staggering," he added. 
Koch's comments came on the second day of a gathering that demonstrated the reach of his network: Some 450 wealthy conservatives descended on a luxury resort to talk 

strategy ahead of the 2016 elections and to discuss the network's push to shape policy on issues, such as overhauling the nation's criminal-justice system. Earlier this year, 

Koch-aligned donors set a budget of nearly $900 million ahead of the 2016 election. 
Three presidential contenders were slated to address the gathering Sunday at the St. Regis Monarch Beach resort. The first, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, drew applause as he 
discussed his rise as the son of working-class Cuban immigrants. 

"It's hard to believe that 25 or 20 years ago my father worked at events like this as a bartender and now his son is running for president," Rubio said. In a wide-ranging interview with Politico's Mike Allen, Rubio said the Obama administration's upcoming proposal to cut emissions from coal-burning plants was too costly for average consumers. 
Two other candidates -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida governor Jeb Bush -- also received a warm reception. 
Cruz, in an at-times fiery address, blasted what he called the "Washington cartel" that continues to operate in Congress -- even under a Republican-controlled Senate and said 
bluntly that the "data and facts" don't support global warming. 

Bush, who has seen billionaire Donald Trump pass him in early polls, touted his credentials as a two-term governor. 
"There are people who give great speeches," he said. "I have something I can offer the American people, which is: I've done that. I've been the governor of a purple state." 
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke to the group Saturday afternoon, as did Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP field. 
Not all of the leading presidential hopefuls are attending the invitation-only event, including Trump, who, in a tweet Sunday, suggested the candidates at the gathering were 

"puppets" there to "beg for money" from the Kochs.

Frackphobics sabotage our climate: If you care about the environment, protect it by using natural gas

Abstract 
[...]while gas remains the state's No. 1 source of electricity, its production there has been effectively banned. 

Full Text 
It is hard to remember now, but it wasn't long ago that natural gas was seen as a critical tool to fight global warming and protect the environment. That's one reason a new report released this month shows that natural gas has eclipsed coal as the largest U.S. source of electricity for the first time. 
Environmental groups used to call gas a "bridge fuel" away from coal to renewables. The Sierra Club was so enthusiastic that it accepted $25 million in funding from oil and gas interests to pay for part of its "Beyond Coal" campaign, according to Time. 
But a few years later, the environmental movement reversed itself. Recently, the National Resources Defense Council successfully lobbied for a ban on fracking -- the practice of cracking open underground oil and gas formations with water, sand and chemicals -- for natural gas in New York state. The Sierra Club abruptly ended its alliance with the industry and announced a "Beyond Natural Gas" campaign. 
Gas next door 
What changed? Gas became cheap and abundant thanks to fracking. And where conventional natural gas production was historically centered in the oil patch, shale gas is often present in places such as upstate New York, where a lot more environmentalists live. As a result, while gas remains the state's No. 1 source of electricity, its production there has been effectively banned. 
Fearing that cheap gas would slow down the transition to renewable energy, environmental leaders now claim that fracking is contaminating water wells and depleting aquifers, and that leaking gas makes fracking worse for global warming than coal. 
In reality, gas remains a vastly superior source of energy than coal by virtually every environmental metric -- just as it was a decade ago. That's because coal is a dirty sponge rock. Burning it emits mercury, a toxic heavy metal, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. You have to literally blow the tops off of mountains to get the stuff. Whole river watersheds in West Virginia are buried under toxic debris. This month, thanks in part to natural gas, new federal statistics show that mountaintop mining is down 62% since 2008. 
Natural gas is so clean, we burn it in our kitchens. It emits practically no mercury and 17 to 40 times less sulfur dioxide, according to our study with the Breakthrough Institute. As for water, simply switching electricity production from coal to natural gas saves 25 to 50 times more water. 
Critics claim these benefits are not being realized because gas has displaced renewable energy and nuclear power instead of coal. In reality, more than 90% of the growth in gas-fired generation since the onset of the shale gas revolution in 2005 has replaced coal-fired generation. 
Wind, solar need gas 
Wind and solar energy depend on natural gas to keep the lights on when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, which is about two-thirds or more of the time on average. Without natural gas, utilities would have to ramp coal plants up and down rapidly to fill in for the wind and sun. When coal plants make rapid changes to their output, they get even dirtier. 
A study at the University of Texas-Austin, meanwhile, found that the amount of natural gas that leaks during its production has decreased. Even if methane leak rates were substantially higher, there would be little climate impact because it is a short-lived greenhouse gas. 
The main event when it comes to the fight against global warming is still carbon dioxide, and there are few better ways to reduce carbon emissions than replacing coal plants with gas turbines. 
Fracking, of course, does not come without environmental costs. But the real impacts of fracking are felt locally. In places such as Pennsylvania and Colorado, fracking is industrializing rural landscapes. The rigs, pipelines and truck traffic are changing bucolic landscapes. Local communities are struggling to balance quality of life with the rights of landowners to exploit their mineral resources and the need for development in struggling communities. These are legitimate debates, probably best addressed locally, but even then, we should not forget the larger context. 
Ultimately, how America navigates the fracking war will say a lot about how clean our air will be and how much carbon we will emit. Energy transitions come slowly. Developing a truly zero-carbon energy system will take decades. In the meantime, despite local impacts, gas can bring us great environmental benefits.

Abstract 
From there, Solar Impulse will land at a location in the Midwest, then New York City, then two final flights over the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea before landing back at Abu Dhabi. 

Full Text 
Weather permitting, the sun-powered Solar Impulse 2 plane will continue its historic around-the-world journey this weekend with the longest, most perilous flight of its trip up 
next: A non-stop, four- or five-day flight over the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Hawaii. 
This leg will be not only the world's longest solar-powered flight of all time, but it will also be the longest solo airplane flight (in time) ever attempted. Likening himself to 
legendary aviation pioneers such as the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh, pilot Andre Borschberg called this "the moment of truth" for the mission and its team. 

Unlike the first few legs of the flight, which were over land in Asia, there will be no landing the airplane if something goes wrong above the Pacific Ocean. Fellow pilot Bertrand 

Piccard (the two pilots have alternated legs of the journey) said that in the worst-case scenario, "a parachute and a life raft" would have to be used to save Borschberg's life. 
Borschberg will fly this upcoming leg, which will span more than 4,000 miles. He will be able to take small, occasional naps while his team monitors the flight, and he will bring 
several hundred pounds of food, water and supplies onboard. 

Given the low speed of the ultralight aircraft, the five-month round-the-world mission will take 500 flight hours -- or nearly three weeks in the air -- and cover about 22,000 miles. The Solar Impulse is the largest aircraft ever built with such a low weight, equivalent to that of a small car. 
The journey began March 9 with a flight from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Muscat, Oman. 
The pilots, both from Switzerland, have completed six legs of the mission. The seventh and most recent leg, from Nanjing, China, to Honolulu, had to be shortened because of 
bad weather, necessitating a landing in Japan on June1. 

The plane, which damaged its wing slightly upon landing in Japan, and both pilots have been waiting there for a weather window to open. 

During the day, the plane charges its batteries by flying at an altitude of 27,000 feet -- well above low-level clouds that can block the sun. The charge allows it to fly through the 
night. 
"We need to find good weather for four days," Piccard said. 
The plane needs clear skies to recharge the batteries, so clouds must be avoided, he said. Staying away from turbulence and strong winds is also important for the lightweight 

aircraft. 
Meteorologists, air-traffic controllers, engineers and mathematicians work from a control center in Monaco to ensure the flights go smoothly. 
"Energy is what matters," Borschberg said. "We need to be in a sunny environment." 
Once the plane reaches Hawaii, the next flight will be over the Pacific to Phoenix. From there, Solar Impulse will land at a location in the Midwest, then New York City, then two 

final flights over the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea before landing back at Abu Dhabi. 

In addition to aviation records, the pilots, who are the mission's founders, want to raise awareness about climate change, showcasing what can be done using nothing but renewable energy. "The most important thing isn't to make world records," Piccard said. "It's to show what we can do with clean technologies," ones that could simultaneously reduce carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions and stimulate economic growth. 
"We will never improve the situation if we continue to speak of climate change as a big and expensive problem or by asking people to reduce their lifestyle to protect nature," he said. The burning of fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is heating up the planet to levels that cannot be explained by natural 
variability. 
Since the late 1800s, the Earth's temperature has risen by more than 1 degree. 

"There are a lot of clean technologies that have been used to make Solar Impulse fly day and night without fuel," Borschberg said. "It is the first airplane with an unlimited endurance." 
He said, "Many of these energy-efficient solutions are starting to be commercialized, as they are economically attractive and have real potential to considerably reduce worldwide energy consumption." 
Citing the fantastic potential of clean energy sources such as solar, Piccard said he wants people to know the technology in the Solar Impulse could be used in cars, houses and other places. 
"We want to bring solutions, not just talk about problems," Piccard said of the mission. "We want to demonstrate we can do incredible things. This is the project of my life."

Abstract 
[...]the state is leading the country in wind power generation, doubling what California has installed. 

Full Text 
From droughts to flash floods, it seems that Texas can't get a break from extreme weather associated with climate change. Emerging recently from a multiyear record drought, with reservoirs at near record lows, now the state is suffering from flooding and record precipitation. 
Texas is definitely being messed with. It is witnessing an increase in extreme high temperatures. That means more hot days and heat waves. That also means more severe droughts, which makes forest fires more likely, fire seasons more lengthy and groundwater more stressed. 
Smart response 
The good news is that Texas is responding to global warming and extreme weather in innovative and entrepreneurial ways. Given that it has its own power grid, it can move more quickly in shedding fossil fuels and integrating cleaner, greener energy supply. As a result, the state is leading the country in wind power generation, doubling what California has installed. 
West Texas is mighty windy, and the state is profiting mightily from it. It has been powering hundreds of thousands of homes on wind for years, and wind power has been outpacing coal and natural gas growth for some time. 
Texas now generates twice as much wind power as any other state. Other states should catch up. In fact, Texas reached its 2025 goal of 10,000 megawatts of installed renewable energy capacity years ago. That's why many of the nation's clean energy jobs are being created in Texas. Much of that innovation is happening around San Antonio, where a Clean Energy Incubator is fast and furiously fostering new business in the clean-tech field. 
Green in the black 
Despite this profitable growth in green energy, the state Senate just voted to kill the Renewable Portfolio Standard that promotes energy transition. Without the RPS, Texas could regress into old fossil fuel habits, the dependencies that may exacerbate droughts and flooding. 
That's why it's time to call a Texan bluff. It's not really about subsidies that Sen. Troy Fraser, author of the legislation to eliminate the RPS, is trying to end. If it were, then the state Senate would go after the $1 billion in tax breaks given to the natural gas industry, paid for by taxpayers. That's in comparison to the mere $12 million to $40 million needed to run the renewable standard. 
The fossil fuel industry, making this vote more about special interest lobbying than public interest policymaking. 
The Lone Star state which prides itself on freedom and independence, would be freer and more independent if it harnessed more wind and solar. No dependence on trucked-in or trained-down Canadian tar sand. Texas can still lead this country in an energy transition. It has done so before and can do so again. And hopefully soon, before climate change brings another mess.

Carbon dioxide at 'disturbing,' 'daunting' high level: 'Greenhouse' gases gauge sparks concern

Abstract 
CO2 levels were around 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, when large amounts of greenhouse gases began to be released by the burning of fossil fuels. 

Full Text 
Worldwide levels of carbon dioxide -- the gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming -- reached a significant milestone for the month of March, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday. 
The global monthly average for carbon dioxide hit 400.83 parts per million in March, the first time the average surpassed 400ppm for an entire month since such measurements 
began in the late 1950s, NOAA said. 

"It's both disturbing and daunting," said NOAA chief greenhouse gas scientist Pieter Tans. "Daunting from the standpoint on how hard it is to slow this down." 

The burning of oil, gas and coal for energy releases "greenhouse" gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases have caused the Earth's temperature to rise over the 
past century to levels that cannot be explained by natural variability. 
The last time carbon dioxide reached 400ppm was millions of years ago, according to the journal Nature Geoscience. A 2009 report in the journal found evidence of CO2 levels 

of 365ppm to 415ppm roughly 4.5million years ago. 
"Reaching 400 parts per million as a global average is a significant milestone," Tans said. 
CO2 levels were around 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, when large amounts of greenhouse gases began to be released by the burning of fossil fuels. 
Carbon dioxide is invisible, odorless, and colorless, yet it's responsible for 63% of the warming attributable to all greenhouse gases, according to NOAA's Earth System Research 

Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. 
Levels of carbon dioxide reach their highest levels in May and then go back down as plants absorb the gas. But the long-term trend is up, according to NOAA.

The pollen is callin' and your nose probably knows it

Full Text 
The delayed allergy season in the central and eastern USA is making up for lost time as tree pollen ramps up in what's predicted to be a harsh year for allergy sufferers. 
The unusually cold winter delayed the start of tree buds in the Southeast, southern Mid-Atlantic and Plains. But now, as temperatures rise, causing flowers and trees to start blooming, it could be a rough year once the pollen reaches its peak, AccuWeather meteorologist Tony Zartman said. 
"Because of the cold weather, the pollen season is starting later than normal," Zartman said. 
The spring tree pollen season is dependent on winter weather, so the start varies from year to year, said Estelle Levetin, a biologist and allergy expert at the University of Tulsa. 
In Tulsa, pollen usually starts in February, but this year trees only recently began to pollinate, she said. In the West, the unusually warm winter spurred an early start to the tree pollen season there, Levetin said. 
The two other prime allergy seasons in the U.S. -- grass in late spring and early summer and ragweed in late summer and fall -- are dependent on the amount of daylight, so they start and end around the same time each year, she explained. 
In addition to temperature, the amount of winter snow and rain can also affect the spring pollen season, and extremely dry winters tend to delay the start, Levetin said. 
Climate change is also exacerbating allergy seasons, according to the National Climate Assessment, a federal report issued last year. Scientists found a link between pollen and carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. Tests show that the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, plants generally grow bigger, meaning they produce more pollen. 
Warmer temperatures and a higher number of frost-free days have advanced the start time for plant growth and pollen production, leading to an earlier and longer pollen season, the assessment found. 
A study published last year in the online journal PLOS-One concluded that global warming and the resulting weather effects can cause the pollen allergy season to be more intense.

FACEBOOK 
In response to severe drought, California Gov. Jerry Brown last week announced the first mandatory water restrictions in the state's history. 
The limits are a good start. The state could save a ton of water if it stopped landscaping Southern California. A desert isn't supposed to have huge grassy golf courses, and 

flowers and trees in every median, or lush lawns for every house. 
Andrew Martens 
This step should have been taken at least two years ago. One would think that state residents would have cut water usage without being asked when they saw how the drought, 

now in its fourth year, was going. 
Teresa Smith 
Ultimately, we all need to conserve water. But honestly, agriculture, and especially "fracking," has to be looked at. We cannot let these industries have a pass. We all need to 

chip in and conserve. 
Brian Michael Grimm 
This is a good step to help the environment. I think that replacing lawns with drought-tolerant landscaping will help. A lot of California is a desert state, not a-leafy-green-on­
every-square-foot state. 
Michael Bria Lovato 
A vast amount of water is off the California coast. It is called the Pacific Ocean. Brown should opt for more construction of desalination plants powered by nuclear energy to ease 

the drought. 
Fleetwood Davant 
LETTERS 
California's drought highlights the fact that while some continue to deny the scientific reality of human-caused climate change, its impacts are nonetheless being felt right now 

in grocery stores and in food budgets across the country. 
Our families need action from Washington and on a local level. We are already experiencing increased weather extremes that are leading to water shortages and growing threats 

to our health, homes and livelihoods. If we don't significantly check and reduce our greenhouse gases from sources such as oil, coal and gas, these serious problems will get worse. It's time to put in place smart and affordable policies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, policies that are urgently needed to secure safety and prosperity for our 
country and our children.

Full Text 
Since Republicans took control of the Senate in January, their actions on climate change have ranged from oblivious to laughable to reckless. Here's a first-quarter recap: 
Jan. 21: During a debate on the Keystone XL pipeline, the Senate voted on an amendment stating that the climate is changing and that humans are significantly responsible. Forty-nine Republicans opposed the amendment; only five -- Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois -- voted in favor. In other words, more than 90% of the Republican caucus rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus. So much for the "sense" of the Senate. 
Feb. 26: Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of -- yes -- the Environment and Public Works Committee, carried a lumpy snowball on to the Senate floor. Inhofe, author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, apparently regarded the presence of snow in Washington in February as evidence that the globe isn't warming. "Do you know what this is?" he asked. "It's a snowball just from outside here. So it's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable." Never mind that 2014 was the hottest year worldwide since modern record-keeping began, and the eastern U.S. has been an island of cool in a sea of global warmth. 
March 3: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged states to defy the Obama administration's flexible plan to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants, the nation's leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. "Hold back on the costly process of complying," he advised in an op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader. McConnell, playing to his state's large coal industry, followed up with a detailed letter to every governor. The Senate leader howls when he thinks the Obama administration is going beyond the law, as in changing immigration regulations unilaterally, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with heedlessly counseling states to break the rules. 
In contrast to the Senate GOP's embarrassing, head-in-the-sand approach to climate change, other prominent Republicans -- hardly environmental extremists but less attached to the fossil-fuel lobby -- are promoting useful ideas that could help the U.S. achieve the 26%-28% emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2025 that the Obama administration pledged Tuesday. 
Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary in the George W. Bush administration, calls global warming "a crisis we can't afford to ignore," and his institute is funding research and advocating for faster action. 
George Shultz, secretary of State during the Reagan administration and a pillar of the GOP establishment, is calling for "significant and sustained support" for energy research and development. Like Paulson, Shultz backs a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would level the playing field and prevent the atmosphere from being used as a free waste dump. 
This plan would put the U.S. on a path toward lower emissions and provide American leadership going into this year's global climate talks. And what is the likelihood that this Senate will approve such a sensible, market-based policy? 
Call it a snowball's chance.

Clean air rules that could save thousands of lives but cost billions of dollars will be considered by the Supreme Court today in a case that portends future battles over climate change. 
The challenge to the government's crackdown on mercury and other airborne pollutants is the latest in a series of environmental cases to reach the court. Its conservative majority has tread lightly on President Obama's initiatives, but a bigger showdown over ozone regulations could be yet to come. 
The case focuses on regulations 25 years in the making against mercury and air toxics from coal- and oil-fired power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency says those rules will prevent premature deaths and illnesses from asthma, cancer and heart disease. Opponents say the benefits are overstated and the costs understated. 
What the high court must decide is whether the EPA followed the letter of the law -- in this case, the Clean Air Act, which directed the agency to regulate electric utilities if it was deemed "appropriate and necessary." Opponents say the word "appropriate" required cost estimates. 
The two sides are billions of dollars apart, particularly on the potential benefits of emissions limits. Opponents say they're worth no more than $6 million annually. Advocates count $37billion to $90 billion in lives saved and illnesses avoided. 
"This is one of the most significant environmental rules in our history," says Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law. 
Among the potential winners if the EPA rules are upheld are pregnant women and their fetuses, whose brain development can be harmed by overexposure to mercury. Environmental groups say 4,200 to 11,000 lives could be saved annually. 
Losers would include coal plants, many of which are clustered in the Midwest, that have not improved their technology to reduce toxic emissions. Some would be forced to close, which would reduce generating capacity and raise the cost of electricity. 
If the high court overturns the regulations, says Richard Faulk, a lawyer who represents companies in environmental cases, "we're going to see EPA's expansive and overreaching regulatory activities curtailed."

Full Text 
A slick, highly critical documentary on China's choking smog has garnered widespread interest throughout the nation despite government censor efforts. 
The 104-minute film Under the Dome -- released this weekend by well-known former news anchor Chai Jing -- examines in-depth the impact of the nation's toxic skies that are the downside of decades of breakneck economic growth. Since Saturday, it has been viewed more than 200million times online. 
While the video remains online, major news outlets have removed stories about it. The official Xinhua News Agency instructed publications not to use several articles Sunday, according to a screenshot captured by Chinese journalists. Xinhua routinely does not comment on its activities. 
Environmental activists praised the film for boosting public awareness and pushing authorities to provide breathable air. Even Environment Minister Chen Jining joined that chorus, likening Under the Dome to Silent Spring, a 1962 expose on chemical pollution in the USA. 
Chai, 39, spent $160,000 and took one year to make the documentary. She said it was inspired by fears over how air pollution affected her infant daughter, who was born with a benign tumor. 
The film, which borrows a format similar to Al Gore's Oscar-winning global warming documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, exposes lax environmental practices and targets state-run oil companies. 
It details China's dependency on burning coal for most of its energy and criticizes regulators for weak enforcement of anti-pollution rules. Using graphs, interviews and graphic footage, Chai is explicit about the cost of pollution, such as rising cancer rates. One little girl tells Chai she has never seen stars. 
Climate campaigner Li Yan, who works at environmental group Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing, said the film was "quite phenomenal" for the way Chai replaced the usually "geeky" approach to air pollution by answering common questions in an articulate and touching way. 
Despite its criticism of the government, the independent film was launched through official Chinese media. The fact authorities permitted such widespread viewing "shows there is a recognition of the need to enhance public awareness, and make the call to action to ordinary people to join this 'war against pollution' as declared by the government last year," said Ma Jun, a leading environmental lobbyist who was consulted on the documentary. 
The film follows a new environmental protection law and statements by Chinese leaders stressing quality of growth over quantity in an attempt to stem pollution, Li said.

A recent column argued that the benefits of electric cars are overblown ("Electric car benefits? Just myths," Opinion, Thursday). 
When I share the math showing that hybrids do not break even financially until after several years of ownership, people shift the gears and say, driving an electric car "is more 

than just about the financial aspects." 
Or they say that I am working for Big Oil. 
Tom Anderson 
Doesn't this just mean we need to improve the production process? 
The system as it stands isn't perfect, but it's still the direction we need to go in. 
Alejandro Diaz 
I wonder why environmentalists rarely mention the environmental cost of producing electricity when they say we need to get away from gasoline-burning cars? Could it be they 

are not telling us the whole truth? 
Bob Smith 
We are absurdly far away from reliable and efficient use of green energy. That use may not even be worth the trouble when you look at new production technologies in coal, gas 

and nuclear energy. 

Traditional energy producing methods have come a long way. At this pace, it'll be hard to replace a much cheaper traditional energy with a much more expensive and less 
efficient renewable source. 
Braxton Deal 
The electric car is basically still in its infancy. Let's give it a chance to progress. 
At the same time, let's not make the mistake of trying to replace the good old tried-and-true internal combustion engine with an electric one until it is both economically and 

environmentally feasible to do so.

LETTERS 
Electric cars are an important tool that can clean our air, protect our climate, and get America off of oil for good. Commentary writer Bjrn Lomborg misses the point in his 

column ("Electric car benefits? Just myths," Opinion, Thursday). 

There are almost 300,000 plug-in vehicles already on the road in our country. The cleaner we make our electricity system -- by adding more wind, solar and other pollution-free energy sources -- the less pollution electric vehicles will produce. Our analysis shows that widespread use of electric vehicles, coupled with a cleaner electricity grid, could reduce global warming pollution by 18.2 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide per year by 2025 compared with conventional vehicles. That is equal to the annual emissions from 3.8million of today's cars and trucks. While Lomborg complains about electric cars, we have oil trains exploding in West Virginia, refineries exploding in California and a climate going haywire. I say it is oil that we cannot afford.

Electric car benefits? Just myths: Autos are popular, but potential for reducing air pollution is small

Abstract 
The added mileage saves little in the way of emissions, and the electric car's extended use might mean it would have to replace its batteries, entirely blowing the climate benefit. [...]because the Nissan gives you only 84 miles on a charge, most people buy it as a second car for shorter trips. 

Full Text 
It is time to stop our green worship of the electric car. It costs us a fortune, cuts little CO2 and surprisingly kills almost twice the number of people compared with regular 
gasoline cars. 
Electric cars' global-warming benefits are small. It is advertised as a zero-emissions car, but in reality it only shifts emissions to electricity production, with most coming from 
fossil fuels. As green venture capitalist Vinod Khosla likes to point out, "Electric cars are coal-powered cars." 

The most popular electric car, a Nissan Leaf, over a 90,000-mile lifetime will emit 31 metric tons of CO2, based on emissions from its production, its electricity consumption at average U.S. fuel mix and its ultimate scrapping. A comparable diesel Mercedes CDI A160 over a similar lifetime will emit 3 tons more across its production, diesel consumption and ultimate scrapping. 
The results are similar for the top-line Tesla car, emitting about 44 tons, about 5 tons less than a similar Audi A7 Quattro. 
Subsidies vs. savings 
Yes, in both cases the electric car is better, but only by a tiny bit. Avoiding 3 tons of CO2 would cost less than $27 on Europe's emissions trading market. The annual benefit is 

about the cost of a cup of coffee. Yet U.S. taxpayers spend up to $7,500 in tax breaks for less than $27 of climate benefits. That's a bad deal. 

The other main benefit from electric cars was supposed to be lower air pollution. Yes, it might be powered by coal, but unlike the regular car, coal emissions are far away from 
the city centers where more people live and where damage from air pollution hits hardest. 
However, new research in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that while gasoline cars pollute closer to home, coal-fired power pollutes a lot more. 
The researchers estimate that if the U.S. has 10% more gasoline cars in 2020, 870 more people will die each year in the U.S. from air pollution. Hybrids, because they are 

cleaner, will kill just 610 people. But 10% more electric vehicles powered on the average U.S. electricity mix will kill 1,617 more people every year, mostly from coal pollution. 

The electric car kills almost three times as many as a hybrid. 
Of course, electric car proponents would venture that the perceived rapid ramp-up of renewables will make future electric cars much cleaner. This, however, is mostly wishful 
thinking. Today, the U.S. gets 14% of its electric power from renewables. In 25 years, Obama's Energy Information Administration estimates this will have gone up just 3 
percentage points to 17%. 

Similarly, fossil fuels generate 65% of U.S. electricity today, and will generate 64% in 2040, although natural gas will gain four percentage points and lead to slightly cleaner 
power. 
Instead of focusing on electric cars, we should focus on making coal-fired power cleaner. 

What proponents say 
Proponents could also argue that the more mileage an electric car logs, the more its carbon footprint is reduced because the battery production is a significant part of their total 
emissions. 

Yet, it hardly matters. The added mileage saves little in the way of emissions, and the electric car's extended use might mean it would have to replace its batteries, entirely 

blowing the climate benefit. 
Moreover, because the Nissan gives you only 84 miles on a charge, most people buy it as a second car for shorter trips. If such a second car goes only 50,000 miles, it will 
actually end up emitting more CO2. 

In the public conversation, electric cars are seen as the new uber-green. But they're nothing of the sort. If we had 25 million extra electric cars rather than gasoline cars on the 

road in 2020, they would over their lifetime avoid 75 million tons of CO2 at a market value of more than half a billion dollars. 
However, at present-day subsidies, they would cost a phenomenal $188 billion while creating more pollution than gasoline cars, costing about $35 billion in lives cut short by 
poor air quality. For every dollar of cost, the electric car does less than half a cent of good. 

For the next decades, hybrids are the way to go, while we innovate cheaper green energy that hopefully over some decades will make the electric car worthwhile.

Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, makes crazy statements such as we must leave a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and 80% of coal reserves in the ground or we will have catastrophic climate change ("Embrace a clean-energy vision," Opposing view, Oil production debate, Wednesday). Does the executive director have a new invention that will replace plastic in the world? Does he expect 100% of all cars and trucks to be electric soon? We will need oil and gas

Dick Meyer 
Charlotte 
In USA TODAY's editorial "Drill, with care, everywhere from Alaska to the Atlantic," the premise of careful drilling is flawed (Our view). 
Oil spill cleanup is a myth. Once oil has spilled all is lost. It is impossible to effectively clean up an oil spill. Even 25 years after the Exxon Valdez tragedy, oil still lurks under the 

surface of the beaches of Prince William Sound. We should not drill in and despoil our nation's most special places. America's Arctic is one of those places. 
What's more, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain is the "biological heart" of the refuge. It is wild, it is spectacular and it belongs to all Americans. 
President Obama and his administration made the right call to take these special areas off the map from Big Oil. We can't trust companies such as Shell with "careful drilling."

Abstract 
[...]we will not truly be on the path to addressing climate change until we have a policy of developing clean energy sources while reducing -- not escalating -- fossil fuels. 

Full Text 
The Obama administration's recent announcements on oil and gas drilling are an illogical mix of good news and bad. This contradiction is the inevitable result of an "all of the above" energy policy that aims for compromise but fails the basic test of right vs. wrong. 
President Obama clearly understands at least one reason why drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Arctic Ocean is wrong, and he deserves kudos for standing up to those who would sacrifice America's greatest wilderness for oil profits. These unique environments are impossible to develop safely. It is not a question of whether a disaster would happen, but when. 
This much we know: The consequences would be catastrophic and long lasting. More than a quarter-century after the Exxon Valdez disaster, Prince William Sound has still not recovered. 
The president's energy policies also fail to acknowledge another inescapable reality. As a study published last month in the journal Nature shows, we cannot avoid catastrophic climate change unless we leave untouched at least a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and more than 80% of current coal reserves. In light of that fact, risking the destruction of our public lands and coastlines to find and extract more fossil fuel reserves becomes even more foolish and irresponsible. 
The good news is that we have a better path. Clean energy is already beginning to replace fossil fuels, revitalize American industry and save Americans money. But we will not truly be on the path to addressing climate change until we have a policy of developing clean energy sources while reducing -- not escalating -- fossil fuels. By 2030, we could cut oil for transportation by 50%. We could also get virtually all of our electricity without burning coal or gas. 
The benefits would go beyond saving our climate. We'd save thousands of American lives cut short by pollution, while protecting our oceans and our precious wild places. 
It is time to put "drill today and worry about tomorrow later" behind us for good. By embracing a 100% clean-energy vision, we can create a prosperous society that gets all of its power from sources that are safe, secure and sustainable. Why should we settle for less? 
Michael Brune is executive director of the Sierra Club.

7 STORIES THAT MATTER FOR 2015

Abstract 
[...]the economic statistic likely to mean the most to regular folks was early evidence that median household income, which sank and stagnated in the wake of the Great Recession, began to recover. In Arkansas, for the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans will control the governorship and both houses of the state Legislature, as well as both Senate seats and the entire U.S. House delegation. 

Full Text 
The stories that commanded the top headlines in 2014 aren't necessarily the ones that will have the most staying power. The developments most likely to matter range from initial encouraging signs on wages to a major societal shift that didn't generate much reaction, like Sherlock Holmes' dog that didn't bark. Following is a list -- admittedly not a comprehensive one -- of seven of this year's events that will resonate in 2015 and beyond. 
1. On the economy: Wages budged. 
A record stock market and a jump in economic growth drew attention. But the economic statistic likely to mean the most to regular folks was early evidence that median household income, which sank and stagnated in the wake of the Great Recession, began to recover. 
"While I would not assign too much importance to any single wage point, there are signs that we are near an inflection point," says Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse. "We think further improvement in wage growth is likely next year." 
Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose by 0.4% in November, double the monthly gain in the previous 12 months. The Employment Cost Index, a broader measure of compensation, also increased in the third quarter. 
Even as the jobless rate dropped and the Dow Jones soared, Americans had been stuck in a funk about the economy in part because many didn't see any improvement in their own lives. That cost President Obama the political boost an improving economy usually brings, and it has contributed to a rising populist sentiment that divides the Democratic Party. 
Even now, analysts caution that one-month rises in wages in June 2013 and October 2011 didn't last. Workers haven't regained the ground lost since the financial meltdown in 2008, and wage growth is slower than after previous downturns. But economic reports over the past few weeks have fueled optimism that wages are rebounding. Finally. 
2. On national security: James Foley was beheaded. 
The Obama administration touted the end of U.S. combat operations in Iraq as a major achievement. 
Then, in August, a video uploaded to YouTube and titled "A Message to America" showed hostage James Foley, kneeling in the desert next to a masked Islamic State fighter. 
Then the 40-year-old journalist from Wolfeboro, N.H., was decapitated. 
The execution of more Western hostages by the previously little-known group, also known as ISIL or ISIS, would follow. 
"It was really ISIS' lightning thrust into Iraq that first got our attention, but Foley focused it and solidified it and made it impossible for America to ignore it," says Bruce 

Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. 
The shock of the video and the emergence of the Islamic State prompted the Obama administration to deploy more troops to the region and intensify a bombing campaign. 
The threat from the Islamic State isn't likely to ease soon. The jihadist leaders are becoming more adept at governing captured territory in Iraq, Syria and Nigeria. Sympathizers 

elsewhere are starting to organize as franchises. 
"The prospect of al-Qaeda and ISIS reunited also is not beyond the realm of possibility," Hoffman says. "We could be faced with two formidable adversaries, both with similar 
agenda and an equal dose of anti-Americanism and who both believe time is on their side." 

3. On politics: Mark Pryor lost. 

Six years earlier, he had been re-elected to the Senate seat his father once held without Republicans even fielding an opponent. But in the midterm elections last month, Mark 
Pryor carried less than 40% of the vote in a thumping from a first-term House member, Tom Cotton. 
Pryor's defeat was emblematic of the Democratic rout across the South in 2014. 
Democratic support is declining among white voters, a nationwide trend most pronounced in the South. 

In Arkansas, for the first time since Reconstruction, Republicans will control the governorship and both houses of the state Legislature, as well as both Senate seats and the entire U.S. House delegation. 
"It was just before the election of 2010 that Democrats held almost every office in the state, and now, three election cycles later, they're on the endangered species list," crows Bill Vickery, a Republican operative in Arkansas. 
"One election does not necessarily define the political future of Arkansas," says Jessica DeLoach Sabin, a Democratic analyst. "It is very likely that control of major offices in Arkansas will continue to swing back and forth between the two parties." 
She says the nomination of Hillary Rodham Clinton could put the state in play for Democrats in the 2016 presidential race. That said, it was husband Bill Clinton, not her, running for state office all those years. 
4. On social issues: Americans shrugged. 
A wave of federal court rulings in 2014 allowed same-sex couples to marry in 19 additional states, more than doubling the number of states where gay marriage is permitted. 
Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population lives in the 35 states where gay men and lesbians are free to wed. Another ruling this month has cleared the way in Florida as well. 
The public reaction? What public reaction? 
Opponents are pressing forward with a challenge that is likely to make it to the Supreme Court, but as a political issue, gay marriage seems to be fading even as the debate 

over another wedge issue, abortion rights, remains unrelenting. 
In 1996, 68% of Americans surveyed by the Gallup Organization opposed same-sex marriage. This year, 55% supported it -- including nearly eight in 10 of those under 30. 
"If there was any doubt before, this year has solidified that marriage is a settled matter in the eyes of the American people," says Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights 

Campaign, an advocacy group. When the Supreme Court issued two landmark rulings in 2013, "I said publicly that our goal should be to bring marriage to all 50 states within the next five years. People thought we were crazy back then, but now that goal is looking pretty conservative." 
5. On race relations: Ramsey Orta took a cellphone video. 
In July, bystander Ramsey Orta recorded New York police officers confronting Eric Garner for illegally selling loose cigarettes. Attempts to arrest the unarmed African American 
became a struggle, and one of the officers put him in a chokehold as Garner protested, "I can't breathe." 
He died. A Staten Island grand jury decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer involved. Garner's dying words became a rallying cry. 
The grand jury decision came on the heels of the decision by a grand jury in Missouri not to indict Darren Wilson, a white police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black 

teenager, Michael Brown. The two deaths sparked protests across the country. Then the execution-style killing of two New York police officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, by an assailant who had cited police treatment of blacks on social media deepened the debate and galvanized law enforcement supporters. 
The Eric Garner case has had particular resonance because of the video. 
"There is real outrage, because people who saw what happened for themselves can't believe no charges were brought," says David Harris, a professor at the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Law. "In the Michael Brown case, people are still arguing about what actually happened." 

Bernard Melekian, a former police chief in California who has led the federal Justice Department's COPS program, says the debate has been going on in police circles for years. 

Now, he says, "there is a spectrum of awareness and commitment that is often shifted only by high-profile events like Eric Garner." 
They also have bolstered broad public support for equipping police officers with body cameras to create an independent account of exactly what happened in controversial 
confrontations. 

6. On foreign policy: Alan Gross came home. 
As he began his fifth year in a Cuban prison, his friends and family expressed growing concerns about Alan Gross' physical and mental well-being. Gross, a contractor for the 

U.S. Agency for International Development from Maryland, had been convicted of plotting to "destroy the revolution" by delivering and installing secure satellite communication equipment to religious groups. 
"There was an imperative to get him out," says Peter Kornbluh, co-author of a book published in October, Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana. 
In a deal facilitated by Canada and the Vatican, the United States released three Cuban spies, and Cuba released a prisoner who had worked for U.S. intelligence agencies. Gross, 65, was freed on humanitarian grounds. 
Obama used the moment to announce the two countries would normalize relations, exchange ambassadors and hold bilateral discussions -- reversing a policy that had lasted since the Eisenhower administration severed diplomatic relations. 
"This is what I call a quantum change in terms of resolving what has been one of the most intractable U.S. foreign policy challenges for the last half a century," Kornbluh says. 
In April, the U.S. president and the leader of Cuba are slated to meet at the Summit of the Americas in Panama -- the first time the leaders of those two countries will have sat and talked in the same room in 55 years. 
7. On climate change: Obama and Xi reached a deal. 
Last month in Beijing, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping unexpectedly announced an accord to set targets for curbing carbon emissions. The agreement by the world's two biggest polluters came on the heels of U.S. regulations setting tougher standards for coal-fired power plants and heavy-duty vehicle fuel economy. 
"The president's willingness to advance energy and preparedness policies that will make a difference on climate change may well be looked back on as a turning point," says Angela Ledford Anderson, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
The political battles will continue next year. An international climate change accord, being negotiated in Peru, is scheduled to be signed next December in Paris. In the USA, critics are braced to fight new regulations. 
"The efforts to reverse the power plant standard, before they are even finalized by the EPA, will be fierce in the new year -- at both the state and national level, and they'll likely be challenged in the courts as well," Anderson says. 
Obama will face a powerful opponent in Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is poised to take over as Senate majority leader in January and has blasted the administration for pursuing what he calls a "war on coal."

Full Text 
Extreme weather events from typhoons to heat waves help make the case to Americans on the need to address climate change, the head of the EPA says, although opposition 
from congressional Republicans to the Obama administration's ambitious plan remains unrelenting. 
"You have fires; you have droughts," Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said in an interview with Capital Download. "People may not call it climate 
change," but they feel the consequences from changing weather patterns, including on the economy. "This is about their own jobs, their own health, their own kids." 

She says the response in states, including some led by skeptical Republican governors, bolsters the argument that dealing with climate change can carry economic benefits. 

Opponents warn that the administration's proposed limits on carbon emissions in power plants will cost jobs and hurt workers. 
"Look at Iowa," McCarthy told USA TODAY's weekly newsmaker series. "Who's larger in wind industry than Iowa is? That governor is not embracing climate change. He's 
embracing the economy. If they collide with one another in a happy way, why wouldn't we take advantage of that? Look at Texas. How hard is this for Texas? They are making 
huge amounts of money on wind right now, largest ever. So we can make this economic argument just as well as I can make it environmentally." 

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has questioned the science behind climate change, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has expressed concerns about the impact of the EPA's proposal. 
The administration's Clean Power Plan, unveiled in June and set to take effect next summer, would limit CO2 emissions in power plants. 
The EPA issued the proposal after Congress rejected efforts by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats to pass legislation. 
This week, a 30-page report issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee questioned the EPA's authority to impose the emission limits and warned the plan would 

lead to higher energy prices and fewer jobs. "A runaway regulatory train is barreling toward us, and we must do everything we can to stop it," declared Chairman Fred Upton, R-

Mich. 
McCarthy responded that she was "very confident that we're going to make our case environmentally and economically," and she dismissed a question about whether incoming 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who accuses the EPA of waging a "war on coal," will be able to slow down the plan's implementation. 

"Certainly we'll have as many conversations on the Hill as they want to have, and I have great respect for people's opinions and concerns," she said. "But I feel very strongly 

that EPA was charged with addressing air pollution and that carbon pollution is no different than any other, no different in our need and authority to address it." 
She dodged a question about how the Obama administration would deal with a provision in the appropriations bill passed last week by Congress that bars taxpayer money from 
going to the U.N. Green Climate Fund. President Obama pledged $3 billion last month to the international effort to help the world's poorest countries address the effects of 
climate change. 

"We'll go back and figure out how to address it," she said. 
Over time, she predicted, utility executives and other business leaders who warn of economic catastrophe from the plan will profit from it. 
"Every time that EPA has moved forward on a major law, industry or others have raised concerns, some of them in ways that I don't think are really as honest about what the 

rule looks like," she said. "In the end, when you move, they run, and they make money off it. It's going to be the same here."

Justices to review mercury emissions: States, industries say EPA limits are too expansive, expensive

Abstract 
"The extraordinary costs of EPA's rule will be borne by consumers of electricity - i.e., everyone in the nation - causing a significant nationwide economic impact in exchange for relatively little public health benefit," the states wrote in their appeal. 

Full Text 
Federal limits on mercury emissions from power plants, nearly 15 years in the making, will be reconsidered by the Supreme Court. 
The justices on Tuesday agreed to hear complaints from 21 states and industry groups that regulations first imposed in 2000 on coal- and oil-fired utilities are too expansive and 
expensive. 
It was the latest twist in an on-again, off-again effort by the Environmental Protection Agency to cut down on emissions that can pose a health threat, particularly to children 

and pregnant women who consume fish from polluted waters. 

The EPA first imposed regulations in 2000 under President Bill Clinton, reversed field in 2005 under President George W. Bush and reverted back in 2012 under President 
Obama. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld that action last year, ruling that the government did not have to consider costs until it sets specific emission levels, and 

that it did not have to decide on each air pollutant separately. The regulation sweeps in other pollutants, such as acid gases, that are not considered as dangerous as mercury. 

But that 2-1 ruling came with a dissent from Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who said the EPA should have considered the estimated $9.6 billion annual cost. Industry briefs claim the 
potential benefit from reduced pollution is roughly half that amount. 
"The extraordinary costs of EPA's rule will be borne by consumers of electricity - i.e., everyone in the nation - causing a significant nationwide economic impact in exchange for 

relatively little public health benefit," the states wrote in their appeal. The EPA had estimated that the regulations would raise the average consumer's monthly electricity bill by 

$3 to $4. 
The government estimated that 7% of women of childbearing age are exposed to excessive mercury emissions. It said preventing premature deaths and brain damage in 
children could be worth $37 billion to $90 billion a year. 

Sixteen states backed the EPA, arguing that because emissions cross borders, they require federal rules. 

Emissions can be reduced by installing scrubbers and other pollution-control devices. Plants can also switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas. Nearly two-thirds of the 
nation's power-generating units had the appropriate pollution control technology by the end of 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The court's consideration of the case comes after it ruled in two major environmental cases last term: 
A divided court in June blocked the government from requiring permits for greenhouse gas emissions from new or modified industrial facilities. The 5-4 ruling did not prohibit 

other means of regulating the pollutant that causes global warming. 

The justices ruled 6-2 in April that 28 upwind states in the Midwest and South whose polluted air flows north and east must comply with a federally imposed solution for ozone 
and fine particle pollution.

Will China follow through on carbon emission cap?

Everyone knows China will bail whenever it feels like it. @punditweet Letters I suppose Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., has never been to China or even caught news reports in advance of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting last week about the high levels of smog and other pollutants in the Beijing air ("Deal is 'a non-binding charade,'" Opposing view, Global warming debate, Thursday). 

Full Text 
In a bilateral deal announced Wednesday, China pledged to cap carbon emissions by 2030 and the U.S. accelerated goals to reduce carbon pollution. 
The lifeboat that you and I are on is sinking because there are too many supplies. We agree to start throwing supplies overboard to save the boat. But I'm going to throw mine 

out at a faster pace than you, and I have no guarantees that you'll throw any away. That is the deal President Obama made with China. If China decides not to abide by this 
agreement, we have no recourse. 
The deal won't succeed in stopping, or even slowing, China's carbon emissions. It will only hurt the U.S. economy. 
Tim Morrison 
We must tackle our thirst for fossil fuels and forge toward a sustainable energy future. If we are to be the moral nation, building the base of a new energy direction is 

demanded. 
Lanny Smith 
Residents in Beijing continue to suffer with air pollution, mainly from coal-burning plants. 
It's in China's self-interest to cut pollution from fossil fuels. How much the Chinese will succeed in doing so is another question, but they know their current course is 

unsustainable.

U.S.-China climate accord offers new hope for planet

Abstract 
[...]China and the U.S. have been locked in a "you go first" standoff. 

Full Text 
Global warming is, by definition, a global problem that requires a global solution. But two countries count more than all the rest: China and the United States. 
Together, they produce almost 40% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's why Wednesday's announcement in Beijing of a deal to limit those emissions is such an important step toward averting catastrophic disruption of the Earth's climate. 
Until now, China and the U.S. have been locked in a "you go first" standoff. China has resisted limits because the U.S. and other nations had a decades-long head start on industrialization. The U.S has been reluctant to act only to see increases from China swamp any U.S. reductions. 
Wednesday's unexpectedly detailed agreement points to a way out. President Obama set a new target to cut U.S. carbon pollution 26%-28% from 2005 levels by 2025. And Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged -- for the first time -- to cap his nation's carbon emissions by 2030 and sharply increase its share of non-fossil fuel energy. 
Xi's pledge wasn't prompted by a sudden concern about the fate of polar bears. China is doing something it has powerful domestic incentives to do anyway. Coal burned in power plants and factories is a main source of the smog that shrouds Beijing and other cities, threatening public health and inviting social unrest. (In a vivid display of how human activity can alter the atmosphere, the skies were much clearer in Beijing during this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit after plants were shut down and traffic was limited.) 
As critics were quick to point out, Wednesday's deal won't solve climate change. 
China's emissions could keep rising for 16 more years before they peak. And the U.S. goal is less ambitious than it seems, because emissions have already been dropping since the mid-2000s as natural gas displaces dirtier coal. 
Despite these caveats, the agreement is a big deal. Scientists say that while it might not keep the globe from warming beyond the global target of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, it could prevent a ruinous 7.2 degree-F rise. 
The agreement also will give a big boost to United Nations climate talks next month in Peru and next year in France. With China (24% of global greenhouse gases) and the U.S. (15%) on board, it will be easier to bring along other big emitters, such as the European Union (10%) and India (6%). 
None of this seems to matter to Congress' head-in-the-sand crowd, which promptly denounced the Beijing deal and has blocked the best way to cut emissions: Put a price on carbon to prevent polluters from treating the atmosphere as a waste dump. 
In the new Republican-controlled Senate, coal champion Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming majority leader, and climate change skeptic James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the presumed new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, vow to stop Obama's efforts to regulate emissions. 
The objections from McConnell, Inhofe and others boil down to this: China should do more to curb its emissions. The U.S. shouldn't do anything. It's hard to see that approach flying in Beijing, or any other world capital.

Abstract 
Over the next decade, China is expected to bring a new coal-fired power plant online every 10 days to give its hungry economy the electricity it demands, according to the Energy Information Administration. 

Full Text 
President Obama and President Xi of China have come to an agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. It's being hailed as a "historic" breakthrough ahead of the 2015 U.N. Climate Change Conference, but I have three words: Talk is cheap. 
This reminds me of 1998, when President Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol knowing full well that it would never be ratified by the Senate. 
China is taking a page from the Clinton playbook. There is nothing binding about President Xi's agreement, and China will face zero consequences if it does not live up to its 
word. 

And we should have no such expectation. This is a non-binding charade because as China's economy grows, so will its demand for electricity. China is the largest consumer and 

importer of coal in the world, accounting for 50% of global consumption. 
Over the next decade, China is expected to bring a new coal-fired power plant online every 10 days to give its hungry economy the electricity it demands, according to the 
Energy Information Administration. 

Unlike the United States, China does not have other inexpensive energy resources. China has not had a shale revolution, and it has no known natural gas reserves. 
To continue to support the world's largest economy, China will have no choice but to break its promise of hitting its emissions peak by 2030. 
Meanwhile, President Obama's agreement binds the U.S. to immediate action, which he will pursue through regulations and mandates. 
The climate rules his administration is already developing for power plants go beyond the scope of the Clean Air Act, and the cost to implement just one of these rules is 

expected to total $479 billion from 2017 through 2031. 

While China continues to lure manufacturing and agriculture jobs away from our shores with promises of cheap labor and abundant electricity, these overbearing regulations will 
only move the needle by 0.018 degrees Celsius by 2100. 
As Republicans take the majority in the new Congress, I will be working to ensure these rules do not become final or put at risk our economy and domestic energy expansion. 
Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., is expected to become chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the new Congress.

Obama clears the air on climate deal with China: Republicans promise to fight 'unrealistic' environmental plan

Abstract 
In announcing Wednesday's deal with China, Obama said new climate change rules, combined with development of clean energy sources, will improve public health, grow the economy, create jobs and "put both of our nations on the path to a low-carbon economy.\n 

Full Text 
President Obama served notice Wednesday that he plans to make climate change a theme of his final two years in office, striking a bilateral deal with China on carbon-reduction 
emissions after about nine months of secret talks. 
The announcement during Obama's trip to Beijing kindled a dispute with some members of the incoming Republican Congress, who said they would resist presidential plans that 
undercut American industry and cost jobs. 

"This unrealistic (China) plan that the president would dump on his successor would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs," said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 
Obama said China's pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will make it easier for other nations to reach a global climate deal in 2015. 
"As the world's two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change," 
Obama said. 

Under the deal, China would cap its growing carbon emissions by 2030. The U.S. target is to cut its emissions by 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by the year 2025. 

A report released last month by the environmental group Greenpeace showed that China's coal consumption dropped by 1%-2% over the first nine months of this year 
compared with 2013. That compares with 5%-10% annual increases last decade. 
The use of coal to generate U.S. power has declined as utilities have shifted to cheaper natural gas, according to the International Energy Agency. 
In late October, Obama dispatched a special negotiator to China: senior adviser John Podesta, who was brought into the administration largely to handle environmental issues. 
American and Chinese negotiators met last week before Obama's visit to Beijing for an Asian economic summit. 
In the days leading up to Obama's arrival Sunday, the Chinese government shut down factories in and around Beijing to improve the air quality. 
Congress cannot ratify or reject the deal with China. Republicans can try to minimize its impact by legislating away industry regulations. McConnell said Congress would work on 

"easing the burden already created" by Environmental Protection Agency regulations. 

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who will have a bigger GOP majority in the wake of last week's elections, said the China announcement "is yet another sign that the 
president intends to double down on his job-crushing policies no matter how devastating the impact for America's heartland and the country as a whole." 
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the agreement "a non-binding charade." 
Given the GOP majority in both the Senate and House, Obama has no hope of getting a climate bill passed. He could issue executive actions that deal with such items as coal 

ash and emissions at future power plants. 

In announcing Wednesday's deal with China, Obama said new climate change rules, combined with development of clean energy sources, will improve public health, grow the 
economy, create jobs and "put both of our nations on the path to a low-carbon economy."

Meet the billionaire behind the Democrats: Tom Steyer a crusader against global warming

Abstract 
Steyer has assembled an array of well-connected political strategists to advise him, including Chris Lehane, a former White House adviser to President Bill Clinton, and in Michigan, Amy Chapman, who oversaw President Obama's successful campaign in the state in 2008. Along the way, Steyer has become a top target for Republicans who are quick to note that the hedge fund at the source of his vast wealth invested in the fossil fuel industry he denounces so fiercely. 

Full Text 
Tom Steyer, one of the biggest political donors of the midterm elections, said his multimillion-dollar crusade to slow global warming rests on exposing the human consequences 
of fossil-fuel consumption. 
On a recent weekday, that quest took the California billionaire to a heavily industrial corner of southwest Detroit whose residents figure prominently in his campaign to disrupt 
American politics by making climate change a wedge issue in campaigns. 

Sherry Griswold, who lives 600feet from the neighborhood's sprawling oil refinery, has appeared in an ad produced by Steyer's super PAC to influence the Michigan Senate race -- one of four competitive Senate contests the hedge-fund founder has targeted this year. He urged other residents to turn out on Election Day. 
"The power that we have is the power to vote," he said to residents who gathered to meet with him at the Pine Grove Baptist Church. 
Steyer and his NextGen Climate Action super PAC are engaged in an all-out fight to guarantee voters such as these will show up Nov. 4 to tip the balance in favor of Democrats 
struggling to maintain their majority in the U.S. Senate. 

NextGen also invests in efforts to oust Republican governors in Maine, Florida and Pennsylvania and works to shape several state legislative races in California, Washington and 

Oregon. 
In all, Steyer has plowed more than $42 million of his fortune into federal campaign accounts since early March 2013, making the San Francisco Democrat the largest super PAC 
donor of the 2014 election. His political organization has opened 40 offices, built a team of 800 employees and volunteers in its targeted states and made contact with more 
than 1.5 million voters. 

Steyer has assembled an array of well-connected political strategists to advise him, including Chris Lehane, a former White House adviser to President Bill Clinton, and in 

Michigan, Amy Chapman, who oversaw President Obama's successful campaign in the state in 2008. 
Steyer's goal is straightforward and ambitious: Get the United States "to transform its energy economy and to lead the world to transform its energy economy," he told USA 
TODAY during an interview in Detroit. 

In addition to Michigan, NextGen has pumped money into crucial Senate contests in Iowa, Colorado and New Hampshire. Three weeks before the election, public polls show 
Democrats locked in tight races in Iowa and Colorado. 
Steyer said he's "super optimistic" about Democrats' prospects and believes his group's voter outreach could make the difference. 

"I'm very, very convinced of the rightness of what we are doing," he said. 
Steyer's fortune -- pegged at $1.6 billion by Forbes -- and his evangelical zeal for his cause have quickly made him the country's biggest name in environmental activism. He 
has emerged as the leading Democratic counterweight to the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who are at the center of a political network aiding conservatives. A 
single group tied to the Kochs, Americans for Prosperity, could spend $125 million in this election. 

Along the way, Steyer has become a top target for Republicans who are quick to note that the hedge fund at the source of his vast wealth invested in the fossil fuel industry he denounces so fiercely. 
MIDTERMS JUST THE START 
During a whirlwind tour of Detroit, he met with the neighborhood activists, visited Griswold's home in the oil refinery's shadow and discussed policy with clean-energy advocates 
and executives. 

He's eager to understand the ground game in Michigan -- where his team has spent more than $3 million. 
Over a breakfast of scrambled eggs at a hotel restaurant in downtown Detroit, Steyer peppered Chapman and other strategists with questions. He wanted to know how many 
canvassers and staffers were at work in the state. Answer: 135. How many college campuses targeted? Eight. 

The Michigan team has hit on nearly 49,000 doors, according to NextGen's state director, Stephanie Chang. The goal: Turn out young people, minorities and others more likely 

to side with Democrats but who might not head to the polls during a midterm election. 
In Michigan, Steyer has sought to cast Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land as beholden to the oil industry and the Kochs. Americans for Prosperity has spent more than 
$2.5 million on television ads boosting Land. 

Land spokeswoman Heather Swift called Steyer a "California radical billionaire environmentalist" who is "trying to buy the Michigan Senate race" for Democrat Gary Peters. 
During his interactions in Detroit, Steyer talked little about the Senate race itself. 
Meeting with Griswold and other neighborhood residents, Steyer appeared energized, complimenting one activist on her jaunty straw fedora and promising to look for a way to 

help them better monitor air quality from the refinery and other heavy industry in the neighborhood. 

(Jamal Kheiry, a spokesman for refinery owner Marathon Petroleum, said the plant "continuously" monitors air quality and consistently meets standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.) Urged on by one of the activists, Steyer joined the group in a prayer circle, closing his eyes and locking arms tightly with neighborhood resident Andre Driscoll and NextGen's 
political director, Sky Gallegos. 
He insists that the midterm elections are just the start of his mission. "We are going to end up with a bunch of e-mail addresses attached to names and people who say they are committed climate voters," he said in the interview. The goal is to keep the conversation alive after Election Day. Steyer, 57, dismisses speculation he is laying the foundation for elective office -- perhaps a run for California governor. But he doesn't rule out the possibility, either. "If I 
thought there was a real reason to run that would move the ball forward, I would do it," he said. "But that's not what we are doing now. I'm not doing this as a pretext for something else." 
CHARGES OF HYPOCRISY 
Before launching NextGen, Steyer was best known in politics for his work on California ballot initiatives. In 2010, he donated $5million to successfully oppose a measure that 
would have weakened California's carbon emissions standards. He spent more than $30 million on a winning campaign for an initiative that raised corporate taxes and redirected 
a big share of the money to clean-energy projects. 

He reached a turning point in 2012 when he decided to devote his time to climate change activism and emerged as one of the nation's most vocal opponents to the Keystone XL 

pipeline that would take carbon-heavy oil from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, to Gulf Coast refineries. 
That year, Steyer walked away from Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund he founded. Farallon, named for a cluster of rocky islands off the Northern California coast, 
has $20.5 billion in assets under its management. 

His critics say Steyer's political activism reeks of hypocrisy, given Farallon's investments in the oil and gas industry -- including coal-fired plants in Asia and Kinder Morgan, a 

Houston company working to expand its rival pipeline to Keystone XL that will transport oil from the Alberta tar sands to a Pacific port. 
"Steyer struck it rich by investing in 'dirty' energy, and then did an about-face when it became politically convenient," Republican Governors Association spokeswoman Gail 
Gitcho said as the group launched a website labeling him "Steyer the liar." He has faced questions about whether he waited too long to unwind his investments in fossil fuels, a 
process completed in June. 

He called the charges "complete nonsense." 

"To leave the job at the end of 2012 and finish divesting, including on a private basis, by June 30, 2014 -- so 18 months -- you may think that's nothing. I think that's lickety­split," he said. 
"When I got new information, I changed my mind, which is what we are asking everybody else to do," he said. "Take in the information and change." 
Steyer said he expects to be outspent by conservatives. NextGen is not close to raising $50million from other donors, a goal first described in a New York Times story last 

February, he said. (Steyer insisted that he never set that ambitious target.) 
CLIMATE CHANGE RANKS LOW 
In Michigan, Peters has held a consistent lead over Land in recent polls. Bill Ballenger, founder of Inside Michigan Politics, said Peters' advantage may have less to do with 

Steyer's activism than the fundamentals of politics in Michigan, a state where Obama easily won re-election in 2012. 
"Most of the state doesn't really know much" about the environmental issues Steyer has highlighted in southwest Detroit, he said. 
Polls show global warming is not among the public's top concerns. Climate change ranked last among 13 issues surveyed in a new Gallup Poll. In all, 40% of registered voters 

said it would be an important issue in their midterm voting. 
Steyer is undaunted. "It's not clear exactly how we're going to win," he told clean-energy advocates in Detroit, "but it's pretty clear that we have to win."

Abstract 
Effective action against climate change requires the type of government regulation that undermines the free market ideology currently driving companies, Wall Street, and -- to the extent that politicians are hostage to big-money interests -­

Full Text 
A pair of massive protests in New York this week brought together climate change, Wall Street and the need for regulation as concern about the future of the planet melded with 
a sense that capitalism without rules poses an existential threat. 
"None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria," is what no less a personality than actor Leonardo DiCaprio told world leaders assembled for the U.N. climate summit on 
Tuesday. 

DiCaprio, who took part in the People's Climate March on Sunday that drew an estimated 300,000 protesters, addressed the group "not as an expert, but as a concerned 

citizen." 
"As an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems," DiCaprio said. "I believe humankind has looked at climate change in that same 
way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else's planet, as if pretending that climate change wasn't real would somehow make it go away." 

After Sunday's March, a smaller protest on Monday, Flood Wall Street, resulted in more than a hundred arrests after protesters at the end of the day ignored police orders to 

disperse. 
One of the speakers at Monday's protest, Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, has cast the debate over climate change as a clash between "deregulated capitalism" and the welfare 
of mankind in her new book, This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate, which was published last week. 

"We have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism," she writes in the book, "the 

reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis." 
Of course Klein, author of an earlier book called Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, is an avowed opponent of neoliberalism in general for what she sees as its 
pernicious effects on society, but that is not the reason she blames if for the lack of action on climate change. 

"It's part of the same story, the same logic," she said on MSNBC last week. It is the result of an ideology, she says, "that values nothing but profit." 

Effective action against climate change requires the type of government regulation that undermines the free market ideology currently driving companies, Wall Street, and -- to 
the extent that politicians are hostage to big-money interests -- Washington. 
"We need to break a whole bunch of the free market rules that these guys hold very dear," she told Chris Hayes in the television interview. "We need to regulate." 
This was DiCaprio's message to the U.N. assembly as well. 
"To be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car," the actor said. "This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals 

make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action." 

Against this backdrop, at a time when airstrikes in Syria and an Ebola outbreak in Africa upstage the longer term crisis posed by climate change, President Obama's pledge at 
the U.N. to take account of climate change in U.S. development aid seemed woefully inadequate as a response. 
Klein had anticipated this inadequacy in her Guardian column last week. 
"It's not simply that our leaders aren't leading us -- at an appropriate gallop -- away from fossil fuels and towards the renewable energy revolution that is both technologically 

and economically feasible," she wrote. 

"It's that most of them are doubling down on the very energy sources that are most responsible for the crisis, cheering on the extractive industries as they dig up the most 
greenhouse gas-intensive fossil fuels on the planet: oil from the tar sands, gas from fracking, extra-dirty lignite coal." 
This is a fairly apt description of Obama, who never fails to boast in his State of the Union speeches about the U.S. boom in natural gas production from hydraulic fracturing, 

and whose administration has yet to take a stand on the Keystone XL pipeline that will support production of tar sands oil in Canada. 
Given this inaction by government leaders, Klein says, people seek refuge in "mental tricks," finding excuses, grasping at potential technological fixes or simply putting their 
heads in the sand. 

Whether the demonstrations in New York mark some sort of turning point in the climate change debate remains to be seen. But it has now been joined to the populist groundswell against rogue banks on Wall Street, the growing gap in inequality of incomes and opportunity, and resentment that corporate money has paralyzed Washington. 
The type of revolution in government action needed to cope with climate change and other social ills is what threatens corporate interests the most and makes them so desperate in their opposition, Klein says, even though this change could bring numerous benefits to society. 
"It's not the end of the world," she said of the needed government activism in her MSNBC interview. "It's the end of their world."

Ozone layer pact provides template for climate talks

Abstract 
According to the scientific assessment, the protocol will have prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer a year by 2030. 

Full Text 
Back in the 1970s, scientists began warning about a serious environmental hazard. Certain chemicals used in refrigerants and aerosols cans were destroying Earth's protective layer of ozone, which shields people and plants from dangerous solar radiation. 
At first, the industries that made and used the chemicals -- known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs -- disputed the science and resisted calls for restrictions. Politicians who worried about the "ozone hole" in the atmosphere over Antarctica were mocked for having their heads in the clouds. 
As time went on, however, the scientific evidence grew stronger. An international movement sprang up to restrict the production and use of CFCs and similar chemicals. And in September 1987, countries around the world signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. 
Fast forward 27 years. Last week, scientists issued their first comprehensive update on global ozone in four years. They reported that the ozone layer is beginning to heal and is on track toward full recovery by the middle of the century -- largely because of the phaseout of CFCs required by the Montreal pact. 
According to the scientific assessment, the protocol will have prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer a year by 2030. 
Chemist Mario Molina, who first raised alarm about the ozone depletion problem in 1974 and later shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work, called the gains "a victory for diplomacy and for science and for the fact that we were able to work together." 
The ozone layer success story has obvious relevance to today's debate over human-induced climate change. As President Obama told world leaders at Tuesday's United Nations summit, "No nation can meet this global threat alone." 
Of course, major differences exist between the ozone problem and the greenhouse gas problem. The science of climate change is more complex and controversial. So are the politics, domestically and internationally. 
Fossil fuel interests have far more political and economic clout than the producers of CFCs ever had. CFCs were easier to replace with substitutes (some of which contribute to climate change). Phasing out coal and other carbon-rich fuels will be a far more difficult task, one that involves asking stakeholders to leave trillions of dollars of assets in the ground. 
But the bottom line is the same: Collective international action, even at a time of global tensions, can head off environmental catastrophe. And the sooner action is taken, the better, because the atmosphere can take decades to recover. 
Tuesday's U.N. session was designed to lay the groundwork for talks next year aimed at reaching a new global treaty to tackle climate change. That signing is scheduled for Paris. Given the track record of the 1987 protocol, another large French-speaking city, in Canada, might be a more appropriate venue.

Abstract 
Major companies, including Big Oil, will pledge to help fight global warming by cutting their heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, protecting forests and reducing methane leakage from fossil fuel production. Six of the world's largest oil and gas companies will commit, via a new partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to take steps to reduce methane leaks in fossil fuel production. 

Full Text 
Touted as the world's largest gathering ever on climate change, this week's U.N. Climate Summit will be as much about business as politics. 
Major companies, including Big Oil, will pledge to help fight global warming by cutting their heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, protecting forests and reducing methane leakage from fossil fuel production. 
They're getting nudged to act, not just by tens of thousands of climate marchers who clogged Manhattan streets Sunday -- some dressed as polar bears and others carrying signs that read, "Go Solar," "Fracking=Death" and "There Is No Planet B" -- but by investors demanding action. 
The result will be a climate extravaganza unlike any before. "This is very different. It's not just policy leaders," says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a non-profit group that promotes sustainability. There's an "unprecedented" number of companies, investors and finance ministers involved, she says. 
"It's a very, very positive sign," Todd Stern, U.S. special envoy for climate change, said in a White House briefing last week. "Business is increasingly focused on trying to, in some cases, be part of the clean energy revolution." 
Today, one day before the summit, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is slated to announce new fossil fuel divestment. Hundreds of wealthy individuals and at least 50 foundations will pledge to divest any holdings in the world's top 200 oil and gas producers, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron. 
"It's a snowballing movement," says Stephen Heintz, president of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which is signing on. His fund is controlled by a family whose fortune was made in the oil industry. 
That's not all. 
About two dozen large companies will join environmental groups and 24 countries to stop deforestation, which can exacerbate global warming by releasing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They'll commit not to source products -- including palm oil, soy and beef -- from land where forests have been recently or illegally cut down. They'll join Nestle, Kellogg's, Hershey's and General Mills, which have already pledged action. 
"It's a good news story I never would have predicted," says Charles McNeill, a senior policy adviser for the United Nations Development Program. 
Six of the world's largest oil and gas companies will commit, via a new partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, to take steps to reduce methane leaks in fossil fuel production. 
"This is an enormous opportunity" for the industry, says Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group. He says emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, account for 25% of global warming. 
World Bank President Jim Yong Kim will unveil a growing list of companies and cities that, like his organization, support a price on carbon. Advocates say that taxing fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit carbon when burned, will increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable power. 
Last week, more than 340 global institutional investors with at least $24 trillion in assets -- including Swiss Re and the Unitarian Universalist Association -- called on government leaders to adopt carbon pricing. The European Union has done so, but the United States has not. 
We Mean Business, a coalition working with thousands of companies and investors, will launch with a report on increasing business support for low-carbon energy. It holds a discussion today between top U.N. climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the leaders of two companies that have pledged to get all their power from renewable sources: Apple's Tim Cook and Ikea's Peter Agnefjll. 
Dozens of climate-related events will take place this week in the Big Apple, but the summit itself occurs Tuesday at U.N. headquarters. President Obama and leaders from more than 120 countries are likely to announce climate initiatives, and company CEOs will participate in talks or make their own commitments. 
"We're taking this summit seriously, both to show that the United States is committed to leading the fight against climate change and to call on other leaders to step up to the plate," says John Podesta, Obama's counselor. 
He says Obama will outline U.S. efforts but will not make a new emissions-cutting pledge until early next year. 
In 2009, at U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen, Obama pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by 17%, from 2005 levels, by 2020 -- a goal the country is largely on course to meet. 
The leaders of China and India, the world's first- and third-largest emitters of carbon dioxide, will not attend. 
Podesta says China's vice premier and India's prime minister will meet with Obama a few days later in Washington. 
The summit will get a dose of Hollywood. Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, chosen as a U.N. Messenger of Peace, will speak. 
"I feel a moral obligation to speak out at this key moment in human history," he said in a statement. 
Though the event is not part of formal U.N. climate negotiations, it's aimed at creating momentum for a new global accord to be signed next year in Paris. Prior U.N. 

agreements have not reduced global carbon emissions, which continue to rise mostly because of economic development in Asia. 

Figueres, the U.N. negotiator, says net carbon emissions will need to be slashed to zero in the second half of this century to keep a global temperature rise under 2 degrees 
Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 
Heintz says his fund, the legacy of John D. Rockefeller, may signal a shift in U.S. attitudes. It devotes half its grants to promoting renewable power and climate research. 
He says Rockefeller believed in innovation and in founding Standard Oil, he put an older industry -- whale oil -- out of business. "I'm convinced that if he were alive today," 

Heintz says, "he'd be looking out to the future and investing in clean energy technology."

Companies go proactive, prep for carbon taxes

Abstract 
The U.S. has yet to impose a price on heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, but other nations are starting to do so as a way to address global warming, so U.S.-based companies are factoring an eventual one into their plans, says the international non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. 

Full Text 
At least 150 major companies worldwide -- including ExxonMobil, Google, Microsoft and 26 others in the United States -- are already making business plans that assume they will be taxed on their carbon pollution, a report out Monday says. 
The U.S. has yet to impose a price on heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, but other nations are starting to do so as a way to address global warming, so U.S.-based companies are factoring an eventual one into their plans, says the international non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. The report is the group's first one to look at corporate carbon pricing on a global scale. 
"We're seeing companies taking steps they're not required to, and they're doing this to be competitive in a carbon-constrained world," says Zoe Antitch, spokeswoman of CDP North America, noting many do business in multiple countries. "They're looking ahead. They're climate-ready." 
The report comes one week before leaders of 100-plus countries convene Sept. 23 in New York City for the United Nations' Climate Summit, at which leaders of many nations and corporations are expected to announce their plans to reduce carbon emissions. The World Bank is calling for carbon pricing as a key strategy. 
"A price on carbon creates incentives," Rachel Kyte, the World Bank Group's special envoy for climate change, said last week. By hiking the price of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit the most carbon dioxide when burned, she said it spurs investments in energy efficiency and non-polluting renewable power such as solar and wind. She said Canada's British Columbia has had a "revenue-neutral" carbon tax since 2008, and its CO2 emissions have fallen while its economy has grown. 
Yet in the U.S., some business leaders and GOP members of Congress remain opposed to taxing carbon emissions, saying it could raise consumer prices for energy. They helped defeat President Obama's legislative push for a national cap-and-trade system in which overall emissions are capped but companies that exceed the limits can buy credits from those who emitted less. 
So Obama's Environmental Protection Agency, acting without Congress, proposed in June to cut carbon emissions from existing U.S. power plants 30% by 2030. The EPA rule would allow states to meet varying reduction targets by closing coal-fired power plants, saving energy, using more renewable power or forming regional cap-and-trade programs. 
California has its own such program, as do nine Northeastern U.S. states, which have created the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI. Other countries have adopted them as well. China has announced it will implement a national cap-and-trade by 2020. The European Union began its Emissions Trading Scheme in 2005. It covers power plants and factories. The U.K. has its own program to include additional emitters.

Economic arguments for and against action

Abstract 
According to a 2010 Harvard study, "Full cost accounting for the life cycle of coal," pollutants from coal add to the price of energy, costing the United States up to half-a-trillion dollars or more annually. 

Full Text 
Using Chinese inaction as an excuse for ignoring global warming is a mistake, a USA TODAY editorial argued, because China has begun addressing its environmental problems. 
Everyone is always saying the United States should lead by example. 
I guess they don't mean in regard to the environment. Meanwhile, we will drag our feet on becoming a leader in the technology needed to address climate change, while China 

and the rest of the world pass us by because we are controlled to a large extent by the coal and fossil fuel lobby and its politicians/puppets. 
Mark Smith 
USA TODAY's editorial states, "if the U.S. acts to curb emissions, it puts pressure on China to go along" ("China, U.S. fight over the world's thermostat," Our view, Climate 

change debate, Monday). 

Or the Chinese could look at how Environmental Protection Agency regulations are hindering businesses in the United States and take advantage of a declining American 
economy to boost production and fill the void. 
Douglas Miller 
If anything, U.S. environmental moves will dissuade Chinese leaders from doing anything. They're not as keen to commit economic suicide as U.S. leaders seem to be. 
Braxton Deal 
The future of energy is renewable. Maybe coal and oil will take us past the century, but powering our future depends on other sources. The longer we bury our heads in the sand 

and sacrifice our future, the better chance China has to control future energy production. This will be the next revolution. 
David Rozas 
There is widespread agreement in the scientific community that man's activities are the cause of climate change and that catastrophic changes will occur if we don't act soon. 

The only debate should be regarding how we should act. 
Unfortunately, the oil and coal interests are funneling money to promote climate denial in a campaign spreading ignorance. That is making it difficult. 
Tom Johnson 
The real, long-term answer is to use nuclear power plants, which have advanced significantly over the last few decades. 
Michael Conn 
Coal-powered energy belongs in the past 
Letters 
In the commentary "America's pain is China's gain," Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., demonstrates a lack of economic insight, even within his own state (Opposing view, Climate 

change debate). 

According to a 2010 Harvard study, "Full cost accounting for the life cycle of coal," pollutants from coal add to the price of energy, costing the United States up to half-a-trillion dollars or more annually. A 2011 study, "Environmental accounting for pollution in the United States economy," states that coal's external costs are 2.2 times more costly to the U.S. than any economic 
benefits from coal. Additionally, a 2009 report from the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, "The impact of coal on the Kentucky state budget," states that coal provides an estimated $528 million in annual Kentucky state revenue; yet, that income does not offset the $643 million Kentucky spends on coal-related infrastructure and tax 
preferences for a net impact of negative $115 million. 
Burning coal is economically irresponsible.

China, U.S. fight over the world's thermostat

Abstract 
China is also making big bets on solar panels and wind turbines -- again, not primarily because of global warming, but because it sees renewable energy as a growing sector that it wants to dominate. 

Full Text 
With the scientific evidence of human-caused climate change growing stronger all the time, advocates of inaction have turned to another argument: It's pointless for the U.S. to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, they say, because increases from other nations -- particularly China -- will overwhelm any U.S. reductions. 
It's true that unilateral U.S. action can't save the planet. The United States accounts for about 16% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. By itself, the Obama administration's controversial plan to cut emissions from existing power plants, unveiled in June, would barely make a dent in the global total. 
China, meanwhile, surpassed the U.S. in 2006 to become the leading emitter of carbon dioxide. It produces 29% of global carbon dioxide emissions and burns half the world's coal. 
That makes China's coal consumption the most important factor in setting the world's thermostat. To keep any hope alive of limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), scientists say, China's carbon emissions must peak by the mid-2020s. 
There's no guarantee that will happen. Energy-hungry China has been gobbling up worldwide coal reserves to fuel its economic growth. But it's not true, as the do-nothing crowd in the USA argues, that the Chinese have no interest at all in reducing their dependence on coal. Their reasons just happen to be more domestic than global. 
For one thing, coal burned in power plants and elsewhere is a main source of the smog that frequently shrouds Beijing and other cities. Chinese authorities regard air pollution as a major problem that threatens public health and invites social unrest. 
Thanks to a popular new mobile phone app developed by Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun, people can now monitor pollution levels hourly in 190 cities. In several cities and provinces, China is already experimenting with carbon-pricing schemes that resemble the "cap and trade" systems the U.S. Congress has refused to approve. China is also making big bets on solar panels and wind turbines -- again, not primarily because of global warming, but because it sees renewable energy as a growing sector that it wants to dominate. 
Taking a long view, Chinese leaders see the threats posed by rising sea levels, droughts and other effects of climate change. 
For all these reasons, China is considering its first mandatory cap on coal use. Whether that will happen, or be sufficient, remains uncertain. Sustaining economic growth that has lifted a million people out of poverty remains China's overriding priority. Signals of its intentions could emerge at climate talks next month in New York, in December in Peru and next year in Paris. 
That's where the United States comes in. As the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and America hold the key on global warming. 
If the U.S. acts to curb emissions, it puts pressure on China to go along. If it doesn't, it gives China an excuse to delay. Thanks to the Obama administration's plans, White House counselor John Podesta says, during the latest discussions with the Chinese "we didn't have to hear lectures about what we weren't doing."

Abstract 
According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, climate-related spending in the U.S. totaled nearly $77 billion across the federal government from 2008 through 2013. 

Full Text 
With growing economies and energy demands in China, India and the rest of the developing world, America's so-called leadership on climate change is highly unlikely to succeed -- and very likely to backfire. U.S. jobs and economic opportunity will be lost to countries hungry for affordable energy. 
According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, climate-related spending in the U.S. totaled nearly $77 billion across the federal government from 2008 through 2013. Many federal agencies now have climate offices and dedicated personnel. 
President Obama is seeking to expand this spending and broaden the scope of the administration's climate activities. The most aggressive of these actions is the president's proposed clean power plan, which seeks to limit carbon dioxide emissions from our nation's power plants. 
Obama's own Environmental Protection Agency admits it will cost billions of dollars per year and raise energy prices for consumers. Obliterating the coal industry will also cost thousands of jobs in Kentucky and across America. 
The Obama administration fully understands that unilateral climate action will have little impact. As former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson told my subcommittee, "We will not ultimately be able to change the amount of carbon dioxide that is accumulating in the atmosphere alone." 
Current EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy testified last fall that her agency does not measure whether its regulations will actually affect climate change; it is simply part of an "overall strategy" to demonstrate global leadership. 
While U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have fallen to their lowest level in nearly two decades, emissions in China are at an all-time high and continue to rise. In fact, China emits more carbon dioxide in one month than the maximum amount EPA's proposal would reduce in one year. 
In sum, the president's climate plan amounts to all pain for American consumers and China's gain. While President Obama continues to spend tens of billions of dollars and seek to hamstring our economy, China and other countries abroad are poised to take advantage of our competitive weakness. 
Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., is chairman of the House Energy and Power Subcommittee.

Abstract 
In a two-part decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the justices ruled 7-2 that the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from industries already required to get permits for other air pollutants. 

Full Text 
The Supreme Court cut back slightly Monday on the Obama administration's ability to regulate greenhouse gases, but the victory was a hollow one for industry and state government opponents of federal regulations. 
In a two-part decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the justices ruled 7-2 that the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from industries already required to get permits for other air pollutants. Those are the largest power plants, refineries and other industrial facilities responsible for most such emissions. 
But they also ruled 5-4 along conservative-liberal lines that the EPA can't require permits from new or modified industrial facilities by changing the emissions thresholds for greenhouse gases in the Clean Air Act to make them more reasonable. That could exempt smaller facilities, such as apartment buildings and shopping malls. 
Even with the ruling, the administration can plow ahead with new regulations on existing coal-fired power plants, which are intended to cut emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The court decision only removed one method the administration uses to regulate greenhouse gas emissions at power plants, refineries and other stationary sources, leaving other methods in place. 
"EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case," Scalia said. The agency will be able to regulate sources responsible for 83% of greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources nationwide, rather than 86%, a negligible reduction. To go further, "would contradict the principle that Congress, not the president, makes the law, and would undermine the separation of powers that is crucial to our constitutional system of government." 
The high court ruled 5-4 in 2007 that greenhouse gases qualify as an air pollutant, even though their impact isn't as direct as others. That decision gave the EPA authority to regulate tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles. The stationary source regulation was the next step in the process. 
Unlike other air pollutants, carbon-dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are so ubiquitous that the EPA raised the Clean Air Act's threshold level requiring a permit from 100 tons per year to at least 75,000 tons. 
The court blocked that action, but EPA officials still heralded the ruling as another in a string of court victories. In April, a court upheld a regulation that forces 28 states in the Midwest and South to reduce ozone and fine particle emissions that flow north and east into other states. 
"Today's Supreme Court decision is a resounding win for EPA." said Avi Garbow, the agency's general counsel. "EPA's inaugural suite of carbon pollution rules have now been fully vetted in federal court and have emerged victorious and largely unscathed." 
The magic of Scalia's middle-ground ruling, however, was that it also attracted support from industry leaders that have complained the rules could cost billions of dollars to implement and threaten thousands of jobs. 
"Today's decision will help to ensure that permitting requirements fall within the authority granted by Congress," said Harry Ng, general counsel of the American Petroleum Institute. "It is a stark reminder that the EPA's power is not unlimited."

Abstract 
[...]not one ranks among the top 100 units for carbon emissions, and only 12 are among the 475 units that comprise the top 10% of emitters, according to a review of 2013 federal data. 

Full Text 
The electric power industry's plan to retire more than 10% of its coal-fired generators within a decade will do almost nothing to reduce U.S. emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, a USA TODAY analysis finds. 
The 140 slated retirements -- mostly small, old generating units in the Midwest and South -- account for only 4% of all CO2 emitted last year by U.S. coal plants. In fact, not one ranks among the top 100 units for carbon emissions, and only 12 are among the 475 units that comprise the top 10% of emitters, according to a review of 2013 federal data. 
These findings show that cutting carbon emissions enough to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's 30% national target by 2030 will probably require many more coal retirements and lock in an energy shift toward natural gas and renewable power. 
Coal-fired facilities are a particular target, because many are old -- the average age is 42 -- and dirty. They account for three-fourths of all CO2 emitted by U.S. power plants, the largest source of the nation's carbon pollution. 
The EPA proposal unveiled last week, a major part of President Obama's plan to fight climate change, does not require states to close any particular coal plant but assumes more retirements. 
By 2020, it says, coal facilities could produce 27% less power nationwide and 35% less in Appalachia. 
The nation's biggest coal plants are not likely to be closed anytime soon, because "there just isn't a cost-effective replacement yet," says Jeffrey Holmstead, a lobbyist for coal-fired power plants at the Bracewell & Giuliani law firm in Washington. 
That's why the EPA expects coal plants will remain a major, though declining, power provider. By 2030, it forecasts these facilities, which generated 37% of U.S. electricity in 2012 -- down from 52% in 2000 -- will produce 30% of the nation's power. 
The rule could have a significant impact on jobs. The coal industry could lose 35,000 to 38,000 "job years" -- the equivalent of a full-time job for one year -- by 2030, but more than 100,000 could be created in the energy-efficiency sector, according to the EPA's impact analysis. Where in the country these jobs will be lost or added remains to be seen.

Full Text 
FACEBOOK On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed cuts in carbon emissions from existing power plants, setting a target of a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. It is ridiculous to try to do this on our own. How about getting China and India to do as much as we in the USA have done before we lose more jobs and gain higher energy 
bills? The EPA isn't protecting any of us if the whole world isn't on board. Sandy Pappas Zeek China announced Tuesday that it would cap its emissions by 2016. That is a positive step to help protect the environment. Bravo to both USA and China. Yang Sun Note that China hasn't made a pledge with specifics, as the U.S. did. It just said it will have a cap. This is the problem: A few are expected to do all the work. Frank Loncar Hold on to your wallets because EPA's plan will crush the middle class. The cost of meeting these emission goals will drive up the cost of power and manufacturing, which in turn 
will be found in your utility bills. Lou Creola A window of greater than 15 years doesn't seem too onerous. Aiming for 2030 gives time to research clean technologies. Terry Mayer Just like when we started the space race, we need to start an alternative energy race. If we can find a way to harness solar energy more effectively, we could use it to power 
everything. Jason Lewis I applaud the plan to limit coal-fired power plant emissions. As a resident of northern New England, I gain little benefit from coal-fired plants yet worry about the pollution that 
has diminished the quality of our air, forests and lakes. Jim Kardas Even if these rules go into effect, they probably won't do enough. But we need to try. David Eck LETTERS Last week, NPR interviewed C. Boyden Gray, one of the architects of the bipartisan cap-and-trade policy at the core of the 1990 Clean Air Act President George H.W. Bush signed 
into law to address acid rain. It was amazing to hear the interview because the Republican pedigree of cap-and-trade is not often acknowledged by today's GOP. Then-Rep. Jim Inhofe voted for the 1990 Clean Air Act. In 2012, Inhofe told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, "I was actually on your side of this issue (climate change) when I was chairing that committee, and I first heard about this. I thought it must be true until I found out what it cost." Too bad Inhofe, now a senator, seems so hostile to reducing 
carbon emissions, even efforts that would positively affect the economy, such as a revenue-neutral carbon fee. The science of climate change is still true, even if Inhofe doesn't want to admit it anymore. Devone Tucker Brockton, Mass. 
We are regulated by the EPA for carbon emissions. While we are so structured, who is structuring China and the rest of the world when their carbon emissions are more choking than ours? What is their part in all of this?

At last, EPA gets U.S. into the climate game

Abstract 
Because a head-in-the-sand Congress has refused to put a price on carbon pollution, the administration opted for the next best approach. 

Full Text 
In recent weeks, the scientific warnings about global warming have been coming in faster than a line of summer thunderstorms. Authoritative studies have documented rising sea levels, "irreversible" ice sheet melting, a northward migration of the tropics and climate-induced conflict. 
There's no guarantee that the Obama administration's new limits on carbon emissions from existing power plants, announced Monday, can reverse these ominous trends. Global warming is, by definition, a global problem. Even if America meets the administration's goal of a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030, the U.S. reductions will be swamped by increases elsewhere if other big polluting nations don't follow suit. 
Does this mean the new rules aren't worth the effort? Hardly. 
If the plan survives political and legal assaults, it will prevent a not-inconsequential hundreds of millions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. It will make solar and wind power more competitive with fossil fuels. And it will improve public health at home by reducing other emissions from coal plants, the largest source of greenhouse gases. 
Most important, the proposal will give the U.S., the world's second largest carbon emitter after China, far more leverage in upcoming international climate talks. "This is the United States' way to show it is in the game," says David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
Because a head-in-the-sand Congress has refused to put a price on carbon pollution, the administration opted for the next best approach. The Environmental Protection Agency is using its authority under the Clean Air Act to set state standards, based on their energy mixes. States can use a variety of ways to meet their goals. These flexible rules recognize that total emissions are more important than how much comes out of each smokestack. 
Even before the new EPA rules were announced, they set off the usual flurry of warring economic prognostications. Business groups warned of skyrocketing utility bills and job losses. Environmental groups claim electric bills will drop and new green-energy jobs will flourish. 
Who's right? The history of environmental regulations has been that scare stories haven't panned out. But it's reasonable to conclude that the new rules will cause electric rates to rise in some regions, particularly in coal-dependent states such as Kentucky, Wyoming, West Virginia, Indiana and North Dakota. 
Even so, a singular focus on electric bills overlooks the high costs of inaction for taxpayers everywhere -- in storm damage, sea wall construction and droughts. 
There's a tiny chance, of course, that the scientific consensus on climate disruption is too alarmist. But there's also a chance that scientists are being overly conservative for fear of being labeled alarmist. 
When the fate of the planet is in question, prudent risk management involves preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. So far, the U.S. has mainly prepared for the best and hoped against the worst. 
The EPA plan marks the start of a far saner approach, one that will resonate globally.

Abstract 
The EPA draft rule, a major plank of President Obama's initiative to fight climate change, will require states to develop and implement plans to cut power plant emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. 

Full Text 
The Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a sweeping proposal today that will require deep cuts in carbon emissions from existing power plants, including a 30% national target by 2030, according to two people briefed on the plan. 
The EPA draft rule, a major plank of President Obama's initiative to fight climate change, will require states to develop and implement plans to cut power plant emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. It will give states different reduction targets but will seek a national average -- from 2005 levels -- of 25% by 2020 and 30% by 2030, say those familiar with the plan. 
Last June, Obama asked the EPA to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to limit power plants emissions, which account for the largest share -- nearly 40% -- of total U.S. emissions. Coal-fired facilities will be hardest hit. 
The rule, expected to trigger legal challenges, will not take effect for at least two more years. Obama has asked the EPA to finalize it in June 2015, after which the states will have at least a year to craft their plans. 
In his Saturday radio address, Obama said cutting carbon emissions will reduce air pollution, improve health and spur a clean energy economy that can be "an engine of growth." 
In the GOP Saturday radio address, Wyoming's Sen. Mike Enzi warned if the Obama administration succeeds, "we'll all be paying a lot more money for electricity -- if we can get it." 
The EPA declined to discuss details before today's announcement, some of which the Wall Street Journal first reported Sunday. "Until then the agency will not comment on any information that may or may not be in the proposal," said agency spokeswoman Liz Purchia.

Glaciers in Antarctica are irreversibly melting from global warming and ozone loss, according to new research. This could raise sea levels by 4 feet or more in coming centuries. 
Quite a few people are in denial about climate change. Ask individuals to live their lives in a slightly more restrained way or to be more conscious of their impact on the 

environment, and they are quick to judge and reach for anything to convince them that what they're doing is really not that bad. 
Scientists are just saying that, as a whole, we need to consider how we affect the community and our planet. 
Mark Mathias 
Climate change is a natural process. The point is, we're doing nothing to help decelerate the process. We're accelerating it. Whether our influence is minimal or great, why is it 

so hard to say, "Let's do everything we can to make sure it isn't us." 
Stephen Castiglione 
I believe the climate is changing, but I don't believe we can stop it. Even if the U.S. did adopt an energy conservation policy, Russia and China won't. All that would happen is 

more Americans would lose their jobs. 
Jake Gurley 
LETTERS 
I don't understand Republican naysayer logic expressed by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., regarding the cost of addressing climate change on a federal level ("We don't need more 

red tape," Opposing view, Global warming debate, May 9). 

Climate change is a national -- actually international -- problem and not just an issue that requires a piecemeal solution. Is it realistic to think that coal mining states will put the nation's long-term environmental good before their short-term economic interests? George W. Bush is comfortable letting history be the judge of the Iraq War, even though he will be long gone and unavailable to answer for or suffer any consequences. People 
like Barrasso are suggesting the same thing in regard to climate change. It seems to be enough if his constituents are happy. 
This is selfish given the global consequences if we don't take the lead in this cause.

It was an experiment to see, hear and smell what is is like to be free of honking horns and gushing exhausts." 
Those words describing the first Earth Day in 1970 were part of a story two other reporters and I wrote for the Elizabeth, N.J., Daily Journal. At the time, concerns about the 
environment were only beginning to enter the mainstream, prompted by worsening smog in our major cities and pictures of Ohio's Cuyahoga River on fire in 1969. Congress 
had created the Environmental Protection Agency just months before that first Earth Day, but the agency had not yet opened for business. 

To grasp how much attitudes about the environmental movement have changed over the past 44 years, consider a resolution the Daughters of the American Revolution passed 
to rebut Earth Day in 1970: "The real problem of pollution of our environment is being distorted and exaggerated by emotional declarations and by intensive propaganda." 

Today, as we observe another Earth Day, there is broad public support for cleaner air and water, and as a nation we have taken dramatic steps to improve the environment. 
The coming challenge is what to do about climate change, which a nearly unanimous collection of scientists says is real and potentially calamitous if we don't act now to reduce 
greenhouse gases. 

Yet, the American public -- in fact, the global public -- seems unmoved by the threats, and some deniers still cling to positions that echo the DAR's attack on the environmental 
movement back in 1970. 
Indeed, a Gallup Poll in March found that only about a third of the American public worry "a great deal" about climate change and global warming. 

That finding reinforces two attitudes that have not changed over the past four decades: 
First of all, we aren't motivated to do anything about environmental problems until they are staring us in the face. Only when our foul air caused breathing problems, and water 
became too polluted to drink or wade into, did we spend the money for federal, state and local governments to tackle the problems. 

Second, the vast majority of us won't sacrifice our high-consumption lifestyles, put jobs at risk or pay a high price to protect the environment. Give up our big SUVs? Pay higher 

gas taxes? Spend more time in the dark? 
Even "green" consumers who ride bikes are part of the problem if they are always connected to the Internet. Various studies estimate it increases our electricity consumption by 
10% to 20% (and it's dirty coal that generates most electricity). 

If we are to save ourselves and our planet from ourselves, the answer now -- as back in 1970 -- is the same: science and technology. Better purification systems have cleaned 
our water and air. Car exhaust emissions are down because of catalytic converters and engineering changes that make vehicles more fuel efficient. Light bulbs are more energy-
efficient. 

Renewable energy sources offer cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, though wind-power investment has recently declined as fracking operations to produce more oil have spread. 

I am hoping we finally invent a "clean" hydrogen car before we are doomed as a species. Another promising avenue way down the road: harnessing the process by which plants 
produce chlorophyll. There is no lack of that totally clean energy source. 
Until then, I suppose we'll continue to mark each Earth Day, then drive home, turn on the TV, take a swig of water from our plastic bottles and check out the latest post on our 

Facebook pages.

Abstract 
Google, using images from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, has also built Timelapse, which shows dramatic changes in parts of the world in the past 40 years -- notably, Las Vegas' growth, Wyoming's coal mining, Alaska's Columbia Glacier retreat and Canada's tar sands extraction.\n

With the click of a computer mouse, the risks of rising sea levels will soon be searchable -- by ZIP code -- for all U.S. coastal communities. 
An online mapping tool will show how much sea levels are expected to rise in each area, as well as the number of residents and buildings that could be flooded. Initially launched in March 2012 for New York, New Jersey and Florida, it will expand to cover New England on Wednesday, the Pacific states later this spring and the rest of the coastal 
U.S. by the end of summer. 
"This is a brave new world. Rising seas are posing a totally new challenge to American ingenuity," says Ben Strauss, vice president for climate impacts at Climate Central, a non­
profit group based in Princeton, N.J. It used private foundation funding to create the Surging Seas database. The results, based on data from more than 10 federal agencies, tell 
a sobering story. 
In New York City, different projections suggest the sea level will rise nearly a foot by 2040. But with future storms, there's more than a one in three chance for a 6-foot flood by 

that year, Strauss says. That would be more than a foot higher than anything on record except Superstorm Sandy, which caused widespread devastation in Manhattan and parts 

of New Jersey in October 2012. It also would be enough to threaten the subway system again, Strauss says. 
With Earth Day arriving Tuesday, Surging Seas is part of a new generation of free tools, made possible by improvements in computing and data availability, that show how local 
climates are changing as global temperatures rise. Another, launched in February, lets people see deforestation, which exacerbates global warming, in real time. 

"It's groundbreaking," says Crystal Davis of World Resources Institute, a non-profit in Washington, D.C. It spent more than two years working with Google and more than 40 partners to build Global Forest Watch. 
"It wasn't possible to do this even a few years ago." 
This tool reveals how much tree coverage has been lost -- or, in same places, gained -- each year since 2000. Worldwide, it shows that nearly 900,000 square miles of tree 
cover has disappeared in those 13 years, equal to losing 50 soccer fields' worth of forest every minute. 

One of the world's top deforestation hot spots is Atlanta's suburbs, where urban sprawl and rising demand for bigger houses has led to extensive tree loss. 

The mapping tool even shows the effect of local development. Its map of Washington, D.C., has pink spots on New York Avenue, where a 15-acre parcel was mostly cleared to 
build a Walmart until the deal collapsed last fall. 
Davis says researchers used to have a multiyear lag in understanding global deforestation, but that's no longer so, thanks to NASA satellite data, as well as the University of 

Maryland's algorithms and Google's computing. 
"It would have taken decades to produce such high-resolution maps on a single computer," says Rebecca Moore, engineering manager of Google Earth Engine, which used 

10,000 computers to do so in two days. Google, using images from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, has also built Timelapse, which shows dramatic changes in parts of 
the world in the past 40 years -- notably, Las Vegas' growth, Wyoming's coal mining, Alaska's Columbia Glacier retreat and Canada's tar sands extraction. 
Google also plans to create a drought map for the United States as part of the Obama administration's Climate Data Initiative, launched with the help of more than a dozen U.S. 

companies, universities and private groups, as well as the World Bank. 

The U.S. government unveiled a new link -- climate.data.gov -- to be its website for climate data and applications, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's National Stormwater Calculator. This tool, for site developers and homeowners, estimates annual amounts of rainwater and frequency of runoff from sites anywhere in the USA. There's also the Aqueduct Atlas from the World Resources Institute, which uses a variety of data sources to track the world's supply, access to and quality of water. Credit: Wendy Koch, USA TODAY

Full Text 
A rapid shift to less-polluting energy will be needed to avoid catastrophic global warming because worldwide emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases have accelerated to 

unprecedented levels, the United Nations says. 
These emissions -- largely from the burning of oil, gas and coal -- grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in any of the three previous decades, according to a 
landmark report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They will need to be slashed 40% to 70% by midcentury and almost entirely by 
century's end to keep global temperatures from spiraling out of control, the panel says. 

Even those emissions cuts might not be enough. 
The IPCC report, striking a particularly urgent tone, says countries might even need to enlist controversial technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
"There is a clear message from science: To avoid dangerous interference with the climate system," said Ottmar Edenhofer of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact 

Research, who co-chaired the report. 
The report, written by 235 scientists from 57 countries, looks at myriad ways to fight climate change and serves as a potential road map for policymakers. 
"If we do nothing, temperatures will continue to rise," co-author Leon Clarke, a scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said from Berlin. "It's not necessarily a 

phaseout of fossil fuels," he said, but rather "a phaseout" of power plants and other facilities that don't capture the carbon they emit. 

Despite global efforts to mitigate climate change, the report says global greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.2% annually in the past decade -- nearly twice the rate of 1.3% from 
1970 to 2000. 
ExxonMobil, the largest U.S. oil and gas company, said in a March31 report that global climate policies are "highly unlikely" to stop it from producing and selling fossil fuels. 
"The risk of climate change is clear, and the risk warrants action," William Colton, the company's vice president of corporate strategic planning, said in a statement.

Give light to those living in darkness: Earth Hour just a feel-good campaign

Abstract 
[...]it was the advent of widespread electrical power that freed us from these harmful practices that still affect large parts of the developing world. 

Full Text 
At 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, people and public places across the globe will switch off their lights for one hour to raise awareness about the impact of energy use on climate change. 
Unfortunately, this Earth Hour event is nothing but an ineffective feel-good event. It does little for the climate in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and distracts us from the real problems and solutions -- especially giving light to those in the darkness. 
While more than a billion people participate by shutting off their lights for an hour -- and saving at most the equivalent of China halting its CO2 emissions for fewer than four minutes -- 1.3 billion people across the developing world will continue to live without electricity as they do every other night of the year. 
Almost 3 billion people still burn dung, twigs and other traditional fuels indoors to cook and keep warm. These fuels give off noxious fumes that are linked to 4.3 million deaths each year, mostly women and children. 
In fact, it was the advent of widespread electrical power that freed us from these harmful practices that still affect large parts of the developing world. 
Celebrating darkness signals a turn away from an ever brighter future. This is not just metaphorical because climate policies keep making electricity more expensive. This especially hurts the poor. With electricity prices rising 80% in Germany since 2000, and renewable subsidies of $33 billion this year, 800,000 Germans per year get their power cut off because they can no longer afford to pay the bills. 
In the developing world, well-meaning Western governments are opposing the funding of new coal-fired power plants that could avoid rolling blackouts in countries such as Pakistan. Instead, we're now adding more joblessness and economic hopelessness. 
And the darkness hits the 1.3 billion people with no electricity the hardest. Increasingly, we insist that they should be allowed electricity only if it is renewable. 
Yet, a new analysis from the Center for Global Development finds that by investing $10 billion in renewable energy, we can pull one person out of poverty for about $500. Using gas electrification instead would be more than four times as efficient. By insisting on renewables, we deliberately choose to leave 60 million people in darkness and poverty. This seems hypocritical, as the rich world gets just 0.8% of its energy from hugely expensive solar and wind technologies, which remain unreliable. Even with optimistic assumptions, the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2035, we will produce just 2.6% of our energy from wind and under 1% from solar. 
Most participants celebrate Earth Hour with the best of intentions. But instead of turning off the lights for everyone, let's focus on finding bright solutions that can make a difference for both the climate and the poor.

Sorting the truth on Keystone: Would pipeline fuel jobs or a 'carbon bomb'? Depends on your source

Abstract 
Yes, it could lead to a massive spike in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, but only if the oil would otherwise stay in the ground, according to USA TODAY's review of the State Department's 11-volume final environmental report -- released Jan.31 -- and interviews with climate scientists. The State Department's review says the 1,179-mile pipeline, which would carry heavy oil sands from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb., would do little to change U.S. gasoline prices or oil imports. 

Full Text 
Environmental opponents don't mince words on the Keystone XL pipeline. Some call it the "fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet" because of the carbon emissions 
from the oil it will carry. 
If the pipeline is approved and the fuse lit, climate scientist James Hansen says, it's "game over for climate." 
Hyperbole? 
Backers say the Canada-to-U.S. pipeline could lower U.S. dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil and create thousands of jobs. 
Hyberbole? 

This project, one of the most contentious of Barack Obama's presidency or of any energy proposal in U.S. history, has triggered a multiyear slugfest. 
Tens of thousands of protesters have circled the White House and Capitol, some dressed as polar bears and others carrying an inflatable pipeline with the words "Climate 
Champion or Pipeline President." 

Meanwhile, Obama has been lobbied to approve the project by the U.S. oil industry, Republican members of Congress and Canadian officials including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who has said he won't "take no for an answer." 
Rhetoric aside, what would the pipeline really do to the climate and the economy? 
Yes, it could lead to a massive spike in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, but only if the oil would otherwise stay in the ground, according to USA TODAY's review of the 
State Department's 11-volume final environmental report -- released Jan.31 -- and interviews with climate scientists. 

Yes, it could create jobs -- but not as many as some claim. 

The State Department estimates that during construction, the project would create 3,900 one-year construction jobs and 38,200 indirect ones, but during operation, only about 
50 jobs. 
Keystone's owner, Calgary-based TransCanada, says the pipeline would generate about 9,000 construction jobs. 
The State Department's review says the 1,179-mile pipeline, which would carry heavy oil sands from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Neb., 

would do little to change U.S. gasoline prices or oil imports. 
The reason: Oil is traded on a global market that adjusts to shifts in supply and demand. So even if North America produces more oil, that doesn't mean it stays here. 
The biggest debate centers on another question: Would Keystone affect the development of Canada's oil or tar sands, which sit below stretches of Alberta's boreal forest that 

are about the size of New York state? 
Environmentalists say it would. The State Department review says it probably wouldn't, arguing the oil would be transported by other pipelines, truck or rail. 
The billion-dollar pipeline needs a permit from the State Department because it crosses an international border. 
Yet Obama has said he'll make the final call. He hasn't publicly shown his hand, but he has said Keystone's approval depends on whether it "significantly" increases global 

carbon pollution. 

The president was widely expected to approve or reject the project this year, after a separate review by federal agencies of whether it's in the "national interest." That time 
frame could slip, however, because a Nebraska judge in mid-February invalidated a law that allowed approval of Keystone's route through the state. 
Two of the main issues are: 

Is Keystone XL a "fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet"? 
Potentially yes. Bill McKibben, author and environmental activist, has used this catchy phrase to mobilize grass-roots opposition. Hansen, who led NASA's Goddard Institute for 

Space Studies from 1981 to 2013, agrees Keystone could unload such a bomb. 
"The tar sands are about the dirtiest and most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels, especially when you consider the damage done and energy used in getting them out of the 
ground," Hansen writes in an e-mail. He says they contain twice the amount of oil burned in human history and if developed, "it is game over -- we will not be able to stabilize 
climate." 

Some climate scientists say Hansen has gone too far. Harvard University's David Keith, a Canadian who opposes Keystone XL, says developing tar sands would not necessarily 

emit more carbon than a large coal mine. 
"Saying that the tar sands are not necessarily worse than coal is like saying that drinking arsenic is not necessarily worse than drinking cyanide," says geophysicist Raymond 
Pierrehumbert of the University of Chicago. 

He says fully developing the tar sands could by itself, "even if we suddenly stopped burning coal," warm the planet an additional 3.6degrees Fahrenheit by century's end -- an 

amount that climate scientists warn could be catastrophic. 
The State Department estimates the likely carbon emissions from the 830,000 barrels per day of oil sands that Keystone could carry. Those annual emissions are huge -- 147 to 
168 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MMTCO2e), equivalent to running at least 30 million cars, 7.3million homes and 42 coal-fired power plants each year. 

Yet the State Department's review focuses on a much smaller number. It says tar sands would likely replace other oil in the global market, so it estimates tar sands would 
produce 17% more carbon emissions over its life cycle than average U.S. crude. Its use could add 23.4 more MMTCO2e per year -- equal to that of nearly 5 million cars. 
"Oil sands are definitely worse than other types of crude," says Sandra Yeh, research scientist at the University of California-Davis' Institute of Transportation Studies. 

Would tar sands be developed even if Keystone XL is rejected? 
Potentially yes. The State Department says the pipeline is unlikely to cause even incremental increases in emissions, because the tar sands will likely be developed anyway -- as 
long as oil prices remain high enough. 

"Rail will likely be able to accommodate new production if new pipelines are delayed or not constructed," the review says. 
The review says rail is a dirtier way to transport tar sands to the Gulf Coast and, compared with Keystone, could boost annual greenhouse gas emissions 28%. 
In an editorial on Feb. 20, former head of the U.S. Geological Survey Marcia McNutt said that she supported Keystone because rail and truck transports would be more 

environmentally damaging. 
"Pipelines are the safest way by a long shot" to move tar sands, TransCanada's spokesman Shawn Howard says, noting the recent spate of rail accidents. 
Martin Tallett, president of EnSys Energy, a Massachusetts-based consulting firm that worked on the State Department report, says Keystone is now just one of four large 

pending pipelines, so even if rejected, another will probably move tar sands out of Alberta -- to Canada's west or east coast. 
Opponents agree the energy market has changed -- so much so that Keystone is irrelevant. 
"We simply don't need this pipeline," says Anthony Swift, attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, citing the U.S. oil boom. 
Christopher Field, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, says the planet has to shift to carbon-free energy sources like solar, wind and nuclear 

to avoid catastrophic global warming. 
"The most troubling aspect of the Keystone pipeline is that it's an encouragement to use oil longer than we should," he says.

Abstract 
Besides the ship, the new production brings back the Cosmic Calendar, which tries to put the unfathomable 13.8-billion-year history of the universe in the context of a year, with all of recorded history taking up just the last 14 seconds of Dec. 31. 

Full Text 
Here's a thesis at the heart of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey: Science is engaging and entertaining. 
An eclectic group that includes astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane and Ann Druyan, who co-wrote 1980's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage with her late husband, Carl Sagan, will put that theory to the test. A 13-part journey through the universe and beyond kicks off Sunday (9 p.m. ET/PT) on 10 networks, led by Fox and National Geographic Channel. 
"The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet," host Tyson says. "It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe. 
"Science should be part of everybody's life. The prerequisite is not that you become a scientist. It's that at the end of the series, you will embrace science and recognize its role in who and what you are." 
Tyson traveled to several locations around the world as part of the big-budget production, but he ventures much farther on-screen via The Ship of the Imagination, a souped-up, modern version of the vehicle in astronomer and author Sagan's original Cosmos on PBS. This ship can go near, as in a nine-minute voyage to the bottom of a dew drop; far, as in the Kraken sea on Saturn's moon Titan; and even farther, as Tyson speculates about the Multiverse, an infinite sea of universes. 
Seth the Science guy? 
Tyson credits MacFarlane, a science enthusiast who enjoyed the original Cosmos, for taking the production somewhere he didn't originally expect it would go: a big, commercial broadcast network, where it might reach beyond core science fans who would watch on a more narrowly focused cable channel. (Episodes will air weekly on Fox, followed by a repeat broadcast with bonus material Monday at 10 p.m. ET/PT on National Geographic.) 
Fox executives Peter Rice and Kevin Reilly "both liked the idea of doing something that no one had ever done before. There's really no way of telling how it's going to do. It could be a disaster, or it could be a huge hit, or somewhere in between," says MacFarlane, who likes having the time slot after Family Guy. 
"The fans of animation, there's a big crossover (with science), so it's obviously not a hard leap to something like Cosmos." 
He suggested using animation, with a graphic-novel look, instead of stuffy, real-life re-enactments with bewigged actors to tell the stories of scientific heroes, "the men and women who helped us find our bearings in space and time," Druyan says. Many are not well-known, including Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century Dominican monk who was burned at the stake for a theory of the universe that contradicted church teachings. 
The new Cosmos shares the DNA of the original, Druyan says. 
"Both series combine rigorous scientific skepticism with a soaring sense of the romance of life in the cosmos. We tell different stories in the new series, and we have greater capabilities in terms of how much more visually stunning we can make the experience than we could back then." 
Besides the ship, the new production brings back the Cosmic Calendar, which tries to put the unfathomable 13.8-billion-year history of the universe in the context of a year, with all of recorded history taking up just the last 14 seconds of Dec. 31. 
Showmanship can enhance material that is inherently interesting but often presented in a dry way, MacFarlane says, but Cosmos does not "dumb down" its science. A mix of real images and high-tech special effects includes contributions from Matrix and Spider-Man 2 cinematographer Bill Pope, Star Trek series producer Brannon Braga and The Avengers composer Alan Silvestri. 
"The best teachers I had in school were the ones who found creative ways to present the material and communicate their own enthusiasm in inventive ways," MacFarlane says, praising Tyson's communication skills and Druyan's narrative style. "It's a show that's supposed to be exciting. When the original Cosmos came out, Carl Sagan said (he wanted) it to be entertaining and flashy, that people who have no interest in science (would) watch just for the spectacle. One of the things that requires is a flashy production style." 
There's politics, too 
Cosmos does not shy from topics that have become politically controversial in some circles, such as climate change and evolution. In the premiere, Tyson notes how forests that grew 300 million years ago became the coal we burn "to power and imperil our civilization." 
He asks: "Is it political if I tell you that if we burn coal, you're going to warm the atmosphere? Or is that a statement of fact that you've made political? It's a scientific statement. The fact that there are elements of society that have made it political, that's a whole other thing," Tyson says. "We're telling you what science tells us about the world, and what you do with that information, that's what you do. But I worry that people are making decisions about the world under-informed about what science has to say about the world." 
Sunday's premiere opens with Sagan's recorded voice from the original series, which will be woven into episodes along the way, Druyan says. "It's one more way for me to affirm my profound love and respect for him and to continue what he was trying to do, to (share) the knowledge he treasured with everyone."

Abstract 
The production of natural gas is booming in the United States, and President Obama welcomed it in his 2014 State of the Union Address as "bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change." 

Full Text 
Natural gas is widely hailed as cleaner than other fossil fuels, but new research says using it -- instead of diesel -- to power trucks and buses could actually exacerbate global warming over a 100-year period. 
Diesel engines are relatively fuel-efficient, while the natural gas infrastructure leaks more heat-trapping methane than federal or industry data suggest, says a study by 16 scientists from federal laboratories and seven universities including Stanford, Harvard and MIT. 
"There's lots of reasons to shift from diesel," says lead author Adam Brandt of Stanford, adding diesel buses are "stinky" and natural gas ones may help cut oil imports and improve air quality. But from a climate perspective, "it's not likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." Burning natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than burning diesel, but the drilling and production of natural gas leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Those leaks offset natural gas' CO2 benefit. 
"Even running passenger cars on natural gas instead of gasoline is probably on the borderline in terms of climate," he says. His research, a review of 200-plus studies, appears in the newest edition of the journal Science. 
An industry group disagrees. Richard Kolodziej, president of Natural Gas Vehicles for America, says a 2007 report by the California Energy Commission calculated that on a well-to-wheel basis -- which includes extraction and distribution -- natural gas in vehicles emits 22% fewer greenhouse gases than diesel and 29% fewer than conventional gasoline. 
Brandt says his analysis is based on greenhouse-gas calculations from a 2012 study led by Ramon Alvarez of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private research group. Alvarez's team said switching buses and trucks from diesel to natural gas might not help the climate over a 100-year period if 1.7% or more of methane is leaked in producing and using natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency says 1.5% is leaked, an estimate Brandt says is about 50% too low. 
The new research says natural gas is still -- despite methane leaks -- better for the climate long-term than coal as a way to generate electricity. 
The production of natural gas is booming in the United States, and President Obama welcomed it in his 2014 State of the Union Address as "bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change." 
The authors call on the natural gas industry to clean up its leaks. Fortunately for gas companies, they say a few leaks probably account for much of the problem, so repairs are doable. An earlier study of about 75,000 components at processing plants found just 50 faulty ones were behind nearly 60% of the leaked gas.

Abstract 
In 2007, he and wife Sara bought a charming but tired 1915 Craftsman bungalow in Oakland with inlaid wood floors, built-in wall cabinets and 1,500 square feet just around the corner from their favorite coffee shop. The result? A $500-per-square-foot greenovation that attracted a six-page Metropolitan Home spread, a Planet Green video series and -­at the time -- the highest number of points for any home under the council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. 

Full Text 
David Gottfried wanted to "walk the talk" so about 15 years after co-founding the private U.S. Green Building Council, he set out to build his own perfect green home. 
In 2007, he and wife Sara bought a charming but tired 1915 Craftsman bungalow in Oakland with inlaid wood floors, built-in wall cabinets and 1,500 square feet just around the corner from their favorite coffee shop. With a "small is green" mantra, he launched a stressful, year-plus renovation. 
"I've had it!" he recalls Sara saying one weekend, mid-project, as he drove her and their two young daughters to the third building supply store of the day. She asked: "Can't we just go to a movie or park like a normal family?" 
Gottfried, who studied solar engineering at Stanford University in the early 1980s, describes in a forthcoming memoir how he was a "man possessed" as he tried to pour everything he knew about green building into his idyll. "So of course I went overboard." 
He insulated walls, sealed crevices, used rainwater to flush the toilet, installed double-pane windows, replaced lights with LEDs and compact fluorescents, switched to wall-mounted hydronic radiator heating, put solar panels atop the roof and built a new kitchen with recycled materials and Energy Star appliances. 
The result? A $500-per-square-foot greenovation that attracted a six-page Metropolitan Home spread, a Planet Green video series and -- at the time -- the highest number of points for any home under the council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system. 
Three years later, in 2011, he sold it. Desperate for more space, the former Armani-wearing real estate developer bought a four-story, nearly 5,000-square-foot house in the Berkeley Hills with a view of the San Francisco Bay. 
"I'd forgotten my Brentwood roots and the ingrained preference for flying first class and staying at luxurious hotel suites," he writes, admitting regret for not adding a master bedroom wing to the bungalow. "As the frog said, it's not always easy being green. Sometimes we just want more, even if it isn't warranted." 
USA TODAY sat down with Gottfried, now CEO of the California venture capital firm Regenerative Ventures, at the 2013 GreenBuild conference to discuss his new book Explosion Green as well as his personal journey and emerging trends. 
Q: You wrote a 2004 book, Greed to Green, about the U.S. Green Building Council (a non-profit that promotes eco-friendly construction) so why another? 
A: Explosion Green is our full 20-year story. It first started with USGBC 20 years ago and in 1998, I helped form the Japan Green Building Council. I welcomed them on a stage in Tokyo. We now have 100 green building councils around the world. We've likely done more for carbon mitigation than any movement in the world. 
Q: You describe how much you loved the 1915 bungalow you renovated. What prompted you to sell it? 
A: We only had one full bathroom and another half bathroom in the house and a second shower outside for me. It was just too small. I took out all the interior walls to get more space and let in the daylight, because Craftsmen are dark. But then acoustically, it was noisy. I like to sleep in on the weekends, but in that home you could hear every word. It killed me -- it was like a child I sold. But I went a little too far on the livability (front) for our family. Not that a family can't live in that size. 
Q: What's your current home like? 
A: The real-estate developer side of me took over from the green side of me. I bought a gorgeous Mediterranean in the Berkeley Hills, and we have more nature there. It could go through a green renovation even though it's only 10 years old. I bought the lot next door so what I'd really want to do is put my attention there and do something with prefab. I want to see if I can build a home that's cheaper, better, faster, greener and film the whole thing and do it with prefab, because custom construction is too slow and too expensive. I need to crack that code. 
Q: How helpful is the recent boom in products to create not just green roofs but also living walls that grow food? 
A: They're wonderful, because they can also insulate a building and capture water. And I like to grow food. I've always thought that each building should grow its own food and have a farmer's market every Friday in the lobby. 
And that's cool. The vertical (walls) get tons of sunlight and can be used not just for vegetative walls but for solar also. 
Q: How much can home automation devices boost building efficiency? 
A: You can save 30% to 50% of energy and water. We can measure and control everything -- every outlet, every light switch, every light, every mechanical system. Every fixture can have its own IP (Internet Protocol), sending that to some control system that turns the lights off, turns the heat off, increases the fresh air, knows when we're at peak power. 
Q: What difference can efficiency make in addressing climate change? 
A: Buildings consume about 40% of energy here on Earth. As (scholar) Amory Lovins told us, a megawatt of conservation is equal to a watt of generation. So buildings and homes, especially the inefficient ones -- which are almost all of them, are our power plants of the future. We could get out of coal, even nuclear, if we all saved 30% of our energy. This is really the best way to get at climate change mitigation.

Abstract 
Global leaders have also made little progress in agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to increase as rapidly developing nations such as India and China use coal to power economic growth. Yet Field, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of research by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said enough is known to help society manage the risks and make smart investments.

In the 1890s, New York City was swamped not by a storm but something smellier, horse manure. 
Horses, the primary mode of transportation, dropped more than a million pounds each day, causing a sanitation crisis. No one found a fix, and some estimated the streets would eventually be buried several feet deep. 
Then, "shift happened," says Harvard chemist Daniel Nocera. The automobile arrived, and almost overnight, it replaced horses and cleaned up the streets. Hailed as an environmental savior, it solved a seemingly insurmountable problem. 
What a difference a century makes. Cars are now known contributors to the modern-day scourge of climate change. Their heat-trapping emissions have helped warm the planet beyond its natural variability. So sea levels have risen, and drought, heat waves and hurricanes have intensified as USA TODAY explored in a year-long series, "Weathering the Change."

As in the 1890s, society is once again looking for the Next Big Fix whether high-altitude wind kites, "plug and play" nuclear reactors, giant synthetic trees to absorb carbon dioxide or sulfate aerosols to cool the planet. Next week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, two concepts will be on display: Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell car, which emits no greenhouse gases, and Ford's hybrid, powered partly by renewable energy. 
Yet will technology deliver this time? Or will inertia push the planet, already struggling with higher temperatures, to a cataclysmic breaking point? 
"I'm totally optimistic," says Nocera, citing a plethora of technological advances, including his own "artificial leaf" for producing hydrogen fuel. "All over the world these things are happening." He says projections are based on current conditions but innovation can shift the paradigm, adding: "That's what discovery can do." 
Even optimists agree it won't be easy. "No amount of new technology will magically solve the climate problem or even help much," unless there's broad consensus on the need for urgent action, says Harvard physicist David Keith. 
In Washington, D.C., where climate change remains politically divisive, action is unlikely. Congress has rebuffed a tax on carbon emissions, which Keith and other climate scientists say would be the best way to spur clean-energy innovation. Opponents such as the American Petroleum Institute say the tax could boost energy prices and hurt the 
U.S. economy. 
Global leaders have also made little progress in agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to increase as rapidly developing nations such as India and China use coal to power economic growth. 
Still, change is bubbling up. Dozens of states now require that a portion of their electricity come from renewable sources. In October, California became the first to require its utilities to install energy-storage equipment expected to boost technologies such as batteries that can be used when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. China has increased its use of solar power to reduce the smog blanketing its major cities. 
"The good news: We already know how to do a lot," says Jane Long, who's leading the California Council on Science and Technology's study on how the state can meet its pledge to slash emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Even so, she says breakthrough technologies, requiring a public and private partnership, will be needed to make fuels with nearly zero emissions. 
There's not a lot of time to make changes, says climate scientist David Archer of the University of Chicago. He says research suggests dire changes could occur if the Earth warms 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. 
"We're halfway there," Archer says, adding the planet could reach that mark as soon as 2040 if carbon emissions continue their current climb. "This is just the fire alarm. This is not the fire," he says, adding it will become costlier to cut emissions the closer the flames come. 
"It's important to recognize we don't know everything about climate change," Christopher Field told reporters last December at MIT's climate "boot camp." Yet Field, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of research by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said enough is known to help society manage the risks and make smart investments. 
The 19th-century horse-manure crisis suggests some solutions may beget new problems, says Eric Morris, an urban planning professor at Clemson University who studied that malodorous chapter of history. But he says it also offers another lesson: "Never discount the power of human ingenuity." 
Here are six technologies some old, some new that might stem the worrisome warming trend: 
1.Solar geo-engineering is sort of the Hail-Mary pass when attempts to cut carbon emissions don't go far enough. It includes blasting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth or spraying fine sea salt into the sky to whiten clouds. 
"They all act very fast. They're all cheap enough that money is not the issue and they're all inherently imperfect," says Keith, author of the 2013 book A Case for Climate Engineering. "The thing we most need to do is talk about it," he says, adding more research is needed on the effects and efficacy. 
"One powerful country could do it by itself," if desperate enough for a quick but temporary fix," says climate scientist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science. He notes how Mount Pinatubo's 1991 eruption in the Philippines, which fired sulfur particles high into the air, cooled global temperatures nearly one degree Fahrenheit in 1992 and 1993. 
2. Carbon capture, which traps emissions from power plants and removes them the atmosphere, might obviate the need for such a drastic step. 
Because of its current high cost, no commercial, coal-fired facility has yet to employ this technique. In May, the first effort is slated to debut in Kemper County, Miss; it's designed to capture 65% of carbon emissions. Earlier this year, MIT developed a simpler scrubbing system that it says can be added relatively easy to existing facilities. 
The U.S. Department of Energy is funding research on how to capture industrial emissions and either store them underground or use them to make products such as fuel, plastics, cement and fertilizer. Without federal funds, Mark Herrema founded Newlight Technologies, a California-based company that captures methane emissions from dairy farms and uses them to make plastic. 
Klaus Lackner, a Columbia University geophysicist, is working on synthetic trees that absorb carbon dioxide about a thousand times faster than natural trees. Keith's Calgary-based start-up, Carbon Engineering, funded partly by Bill Gates, is developing industrial-scale technologies to capture carbon from the atmosphere and use it to produce low-carbon transportation fuels. 
3. Artificial photosynthesis could yield an entirely new, emissions-free energy source. In 2011, Nocera unveiled his "artificial leaf" a credit-card-sized silicon solar wafer that, when placed in a glass of tap water and exposed to sunlight, generates hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that can be stored and when needed recombined in a fuel cell to generate electricity. 
"We already know how to do this," Nocera says. The problem: His water-splitting device generates hydrogen fuel, but there's no network yet of hydrogen filling stations in the United States. So his start-up, Sun Catalytix, launched to develop the device, is now focusing instead on grid-scale flow batteries. 
DOE is funding related research at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, led by the California Institute of Technology. "The goal is to produce a chemical liquid fuel" that can replace gasoline, says spokesman William Royea, adding it will likely take a decade or so to reduce costs enough to make it commercially viable. 
4. Solar and wind power have surged in recent years, and research is finding new applications. MIT and Sandia National Laboratories have developed ultralight, atom-thin solar cells that can be embedded in flexible products like drapes or harder structures like a tablet's outer shell to produce power. Similarly, they're developing transparent cells that can be placed on windows. 
Companies such as California-based Makani, acquired this year by Google, are trying to harness power from high-altitude wind, which is faster and steadier. Their challenge: tethering airborne turbines hundreds of feet off the ground without interfering with aircraft. MIT researchers are looking at far-offshore wind turbines and, to store their power and anchor them, huge concrete spheres that sit on the seafloor. 
"Storage will be the game changer" for solar and wind, because their power is intermittent but electric grids need consistency, says Bob Armstrong,director of the MIT Energy Initiative. So universities, start-ups and major companies are working to boost battery performance. Some advances debuted this year, including a battery by General Electric that's paired with a Texas wind farm to provide continuous power. 
5. Nuclear power, disliked by many environmentalists because of safety and waste disposal concerns, is welcomed by climate scientists including James Hansen as a major energy source that doesn't emit carbon. 
DOE has offered $8.3 billion in loan guarantees to help build a nuclear power plant in Georgia and is funding efforts by two companies North Carolina-based Babcock & Wilcox and Oregon-based NuScale Power to develop small modular reactors. These school bus-size versions of current light water reactors could be made in U.S. factories and moved from site to site. DOE says it expects commercial operation around 2025. 
TerraPower, a start-up in Bellevue, Wash., that's partly funded by Bill Gates, is developing a larger, 500-megawatt, "traveling wave" reactor that runs on nuclear waste and can go 40 years without refueling. Last year, Gates said the company is looking to build a demonstration plant and "China is one possible place." This month, DOE posted a proposed agreement between an unnamed U.S. company and the Chinese government to develop such a reactor. 
6. Efficiency is often seen as the invisible energy source, because it's energy not used. Though basic technology, its potential is huge. Long, who's studying California's efforts, estimates efficiency upgrades could halve the state's energy demand by 2050. Building practices such as superior insulation and air sealing have proven to slash a home's energy use up to 90%. 
"This is the best way to get at climate mitigation," says David Gottfried, co-founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, a private non-profit group. Noting that residential and commercial buildings account for nearly 40% of total U.S. energy use, he says ultra-efficient buildings can essentially become "our power plants of the future." 
IBM is working with cities, utilities and the federal government to boost efficiency by using sensors, meters and digital controls to monitor and automate how energy is used. The Obama administration is requiring new cars and light trucks to nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025.

TRUTH ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
I can still remember the old 1960s TV show "Truth or Consequences." But at that young age, I really didn't understand what was going on. Why did people give wrong answers on purpose? And what were "consequences"? It appears many of our leaders still haven't grasped the meaning of "consequences" when it comes to climate change. But given the recent article "Rising sea levels torment 
Norfolk, Va., and coastal U.S.," we can no longer avoid the truth. Sea level rise is just one of the ways climate change will blight our health, wealth and well-being. 
And the truth is that fossil fuel emissions are responsible. 
Fortunately for our climate and our economy, there is an elegant, market-friendly way to roll back these emissions: a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Collecting it as a "user fee" 

from coal, oil and gas producers, based on the fuel's carbon content, will send a price signal to inventors and investors to find the best ways to reduce their usage or deploy 
substitutes. And returning 100% of the revenue back to the public will neutralize the pocketbook hit from higher energy costs. 
No more excuses, and no more giving wrong answers on purpose.

THE NAME OF THE GAME 

If we ever needed evidence of the role of money in collegiate sports, look at the bowl games. 
Bowl games named after companies that sell underwear (Gildan New Mexico Bowl), weight-loss products (AdvoCare V100 Independence Bowl) and auto parts (AutoZone Liberty 
Bowl) dominate the schedule. 

While there have always been sponsors for the games, in the past, they didn't try to push their wares so much that they took over the names of the games! 

The Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl? The San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl? Who needs a game for entertainment value? Pay the players and drop the 
hypocrisy.

Abstract 
Three of five say global warming is a very serious global problem, and two of three say it will hurt future generations either a lot or a great deal if nothing is done to reduce it, according to the poll of 801 U.S. adults done in conjunction with Stanford University and Resources for the Future, a non-partisan research group, which funded the research.

Most Americans say global warming is serious and want the United States to address it, but their support for government regulations has fallen in recent years, says a poll out today conducted for USA TODAY. 
Three of five say global warming is a very serious global problem, and two of three say it will hurt future generations either a lot or a great deal if nothing is done to reduce it, according to the poll of 801 U.S. adults done in conjunction with Stanford University and Resources for the Future, a non-partisan research group, which funded the research. 
"It seems obvious" the Earth is warming, says survey participant Ken Anderson, 30, a database administrator in West Valley, Utah, citing consensus among climate scientists about the overall issue. Yet, he says, "it will be more of a concern for my children and my children's children." 
Also notable: 71% say they see the effects of global warming, and 28% say it made the damage from last year's Superstorm Sandy "much worse," though 41% say it had no effect. 
"Large majorities of Americans remain concerned about global warming," says co-author Jon Krosnick, Stanford professor of communication, political science and psychology. Three of four (73%) say global warming is "probably happening," but 85% took that view in 2006. 
Other climate polls -- each with differently worded questions -- have shown slightly fewer Americans say global warming is real but they also find that attitudes have stabilized in recent years. Last month, Pew Research Center said 67% see "solid evidence" the Earth is warming -- about the same as in 2012 but up from 57% in 2009 and still down from 77% in 2006. 
"It's consistent with the patterns we've seen," says Frederick Mayer, a professor of public policy and the environment at Duke University. He says the findings are "modestly encouraging for modest policy action." 
This year, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that new power plants can emit. The rules, slated to be finalized next year, mostly target coal-fired plants because of their relatively higher emissions. 
The poll finds a slight majority of Americans, 55%, back a government limit on power plant emissions, and only 21% say it's a "good idea" to get electricity from coal. 
The poll found that at least 75% say the United States should take steps soon to try to prepare for global warming, even if other nations do less. Nearly half, or 44%, say such actions will help the U.S. economy; 30% say they will hurt it. 
The results show a noticeable dip in Americans who say the government should require that cars, appliances and buildings use less energy. Those who say it should require more fuel-efficient cars dropped from 44% in 2006 to 27% now. Those who favor such an approach for appliances fell from 41% to 26% in the same time period. 
Stephen Ansolabehere, government professor at Harvard University, says that shift may be due to a decline in the public's confidence in the government, noting the bumpy rollout of the Affordable Care Act. 
Survey participant Theolyn Brock, 42, who has lived in Florida since 1974, says hurricanes and beach erosion in her state have definitely worsened in recent decades, and she attributes part of that to global warming. She'd like to see a U.S. shift toward solar and wind power similar to what Germany's doing. She recently returned from a vacation there: "You could see it everywhere -- solar panel after solar panel."

Americans: Global warming is real: Concerns higher in drought-hit areas, study finds

Abstract 
Krosnick says the data, based on 23 surveys -- mostly by Stanford -- suggest members of Congress who question global warming or oppose EPA power plant rules may not have an accurate view of what their constituents want. 

Full Text 
The vast majority of Americans in each of 40-plus states surveyed say global warming is real, serious and man-made -- and the concerns are higher in coastal and drought-stricken areas, says an analysis out today. 
At least 75% of U.S. adults say global warming has been happening, but the Stanford University research found that 84% or more took that view in states recently hit by drought -- Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas -- or vulnerable to sea-level rise: Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. 
Despite intense debate in Congress on global warming, the research found broad public agreement on the issue and its remedies. Most say past warming has been caused largely by human activities -- ranging from a low of 65% in Utah to a high of 92% in Rhode Island. Most also back government curbs on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants -- from 62% in Utah to 90% in New Hampshire. 
"The consistency of findings across states was especially surprising to me," says author and professor Jon Krosnick, director of Stanford's Political Psychology Research Group, adding the analysis is likely the first to offer state-by-state breakdowns. He plans to release the findings today on Capitol Hill. 
Krosnick says the data, based on 23 surveys -- mostly by Stanford -- suggest members of Congress who question global warming or oppose EPA power plant rules may not have an accurate view of what their constituents want. 
"This is still a politically divisive issue," says Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. He says just because most constituents want action doesn't mean a lawmaker's political base does. A national Pew poll last month found that while 67% of Americans say there's solid evidence the earth has been warming, the GOP is deeply divided. Just 25% of Tea Party Republicans say there's such evidence compared to 61% of other Republicans. 
Stanford's analysis looks at opinion on 22 questions, some of which had sufficient data from all but four states -- Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota and Wyoming. It finds that in every state surveyed, most Americans support efforts to produce renewable energy and reduce air pollution from coal as well as boosting energy efficiency for cars and buildings. 
Less popular were government policies to encourage the building of electric vehicles and nuclear power plants. Most unpopular were higher consumption taxes on electricity and gasoline.

Abstract 
Jennifer Moroney and Stephanie Pezard, U.S. News & World Report: "As the United States rebalances toward Asia -- a region of the world that bears the brunt of more than half of the world's natural disasters -- humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is bound to become an even more frequent mission of the U.S. military than it is already.

Jessica Alexander, The Dallas Morning News: "Wanting to help victims of a massive disaster is a human instinct that should be lauded. Unfortunately, well-meaning people repeatedly get it wrong. This time, it seems that some are already responding in unsuitable ways. When old shoes and clothes are sent from the U.S., they just waste people's time and slow down getting lifesaving medicines and food to affected people. There is one simple way that people who want to help can help: Donate money." 
Adam Sobel, CNN: "Does it seem, in fact, that these weather disasters are happening more often? Well, they are. The damage caused by tropical cyclones has risen dramatically in the past century everywhere it has been assessed. But essentially all of that is attributable to development of vulnerable coastlines, rather than changes in the storms themselves. The population of the Philippines, rich in vulnerable coastlines, has roughly doubled in the past 30 years. There as elsewhere, more people are simply exposed to danger." 
Jennifer Moroney and Stephanie Pezard, U.S. News & World Report: "As the United States rebalances toward Asia -- a region of the world that bears the brunt of more than half of the world's natural disasters -- humanitarian assistance and disaster relief is bound to become an even more frequent mission of the U.S. military than it is already. Improved preparedness and efficient coordination mechanisms can help ensure that, when time is of the essence, the United States provides the most effective response." 
Conor Friedersdorf, The Atlantic: "When I read a rundown of military assets being sent to rescue survivors and deliver supplies, I feel grateful for the logistics officers marshaling their expertise, but also struck by the fact that the tools we're using were designed to fight wars and are being temporarily repurposed. I wonder what a fleet as well-funded as the U.S. military's would look like if it were optimized for natural disaster response. How many victims would have been reached already?" 
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, editorial: "We can write checks, and should, but we've got our own natural disasters -- heat, flood, drought, tornadoes and (knock wood) the New Madrid Fault. We've got earthquakes in our hemisphere (Haiti 2010) that haven't been cleaned up. Climate disasters are coming so fast that the Philippines can't catch up. And maybe not the rest of us, either. If we're wise, the Philippines will be the canary in the global coal mine. This is where the worst effects of global warming are being felt first. Without serious, sustained attention and the kind of sacrifices in lifestyle that few nations seem prepared to make, every coast will feel what the coasts of the Philippines felt. Perhaps not as violently, but every bit as surely."

After Sandy's blackouts, its microgrids to the rescue: Mini networks keep power going when disaster hits

Abstract 
"There's more attention to grid reliability," says Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program, adding Sandy also showed how decades-old technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP) can save the day. 

Full Text 
From the military to main street, the United States is trying to avoid Superstorm Sandy-like blackouts by developing more backup power in the form of microgrids. 
Many of these mini networks produce power onsite and store it for emergencies. They operate independently of the nation's electrical grid, which distributes power from coal, natural gas or nuclear plants, so they can keep the lights on when a storm brings down the grid. 
Just one year after Sandy turned out the lights on 8.5 million Americans, there's been a proliferation of generators, fuel cells, solar panels paired with batteries, and combined heat and power technologies. These varying microgrids aim to make the main grid more "resilient" -- energy's 2013 buzzword. 
"Sandy was a game changer," says Tom Leyden, CEO of Solar Grid Storage, a company that develops battery systems to store solar power, which fluctuates throughout the day. He says the massive storm -- along with lower solar prices, better batteries and rising climate change concerns -- has amplified the need for storing renewable energy that is starting to transform the utility industry. 
On Oct. 17, California became the first U.S. state to require utilities to maintain a certain amount of energy storage. In July, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order to urge that utilities pay microgrids higher prices for backup power they can quickly provide the main grid. 
"There's more attention to grid reliability," says Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program, adding Sandy also showed how decades-old technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP) can save the day. She says New York University and Long Island's South Oaks Hospital didn't go dark after Sandy, because their CHP systems -- also known as co-generation -- don't draw electricity from the grid but rather generate it onsite by reusing energy that's normally wasted in power generation. 
While most are tied into the grid and can bolster its efficiency, some microgrids operate completely on their own. Off-grid homes with rooftop solar panels, or those with backup generators, are essentially "nano" grids. 
Microgrids -- once used mostly by colleges and hospitals -- are now expanding to other facilities as the U.S. Department of Defense, businesses and local governments work to avoid the risks posed by extreme weather, expected to intensify with climate change-related power risks. 
More than 50 U.S. military bases now operate, plan or are testing microgrids, according to fourth-quarter 2013 data by Navigant Consulting, a research group that's compiled a microgrid database. 
"The United States is by far the world's leader on microgrids," says Navigant's Peter Asmus, principal research analyst. He says the nation now accounts for nearly two-thirds, or 62%, of global microgrid capacity that's either planned or operational. He says the number of microgrids worldwide has increased from about 400 early last year to about 600 now, nearly half of which are in the U.S. 
Asmus says Sandy, along with other recent extreme weather events, exposed the growing unreliability of the nation's aging and "Balkanized" power grid, which is subject to varying state-by-state regulations. 
Connecticut, spurred by Hurricane Irene in 2011, passed a law last year to launch the first statewide microgrid program, which aims to ensure continuous power for town centers and other critical facilities. 
"Microgrids play a major role in our efforts to modernize and harden our infrastructure to withstand severe weather," Connecticut's Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy said in July as he announced the program's nine pilot projects in eight cities. The projects will use CHP systems, natural gas turbines, fuel cells and solar panels -- some in combination. 
In the last month alone, the governors of New York and New Jersey have also announced additional funding for microgrid projects in their states, both of which were pummeled by Sandy. 
In August, the Department of Energy said it's partnering with New Jersey to develop the first microgrid for a U.S. transit system. They're calling it "NJ TransitGrid" and enlisting the expertise of DOE's Sandia National Laboratories, which has designed advanced microgrids already in use at more than 20 U.S. military bases. 
"I think it'll be a model for the country," N.J. GOP Gov. Chris Christie said at the announcement event in Secaucus, N.J., attended by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. 
DOD and DOE are trying to standardize technologies for microgrids, and they're working with companies including SAIC, Lockheed Martin, and General Electric. In August, San Diego-based Power Analytics announced it will install at naval facilities in San Diego County its software that manages microgrids by targeting how best to use backup power when a storm approaches. 
The private sector is also embracing microgrids. Earlier this month, CenturyLink said it will install Bloom Energy fuel cells at one of its data centers in Irvine, Calif., to generate enough of its own power to protect critical loads from outages. In September, Maryland developer Konterra installed a solar microgrid project at its headquarters in Laurel, Md. 
Despite the big push for microgrids, obstacles remain. Some states, including New York, have regulations that don't specify what they are so their legal status is unclear. Also, federal tax incentives for some technologies ideal for microgrids, including CHP, are expiring at the end of 2016. 
"Any transformation takes time," Leyden says about bumps in the road. "That's what we're experiencing."

Abstract 
Conservation measures ensued, including a doubling of vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, a national 55-mph speed limit, pleas for fewer Christmas lights and a "Don't be Fuelish" ad campaign. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Department of Energy were established in the mid-1970s, when U.S. funding increased for alternate drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) that are expected soon to make the U.S. the world's largest energy producer.

This year, Modern Family espouses gay marriage and Miley "twerking" Cyrus' Wrecking Ball sells big. But on energy, the U.S. still relies on imports for the same share of its petroleum use: 35%. 
How different are we? While the nation's social and economic fiber has changed dramatically, including a recent surge in energy production, could the oil shock of 40 years ago happen again? Today's continuing dependence suggests, yes, unfortunately, it could. 
On Oct. 20, 1973, as U.S. oil production stood near its 1970 peak, Arab countries banned oil exports to the U.S. in retaliation for its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The five-month embargo quadrupled energy prices and pummeled the U.S. economy, causing consumers to wait hours in long, often angry lines at gas stations. 
The embargo helped launch a U.S. energy revolution as President Nixon, and every successor since, called for "energy independence." Conservation measures ensued, including a doubling of vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, a national 55-mph speed limit, pleas for fewer Christmas lights and a "Don't be Fuelish" ad campaign. Renewable energy got a boost in President Carter's term, when solar panels were installed on the White House roof. 
Some of these efforts petered out in the 1980s and 1990s, as Americans recovered from the oil shock, but others held. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Department of Energy were established in the mid-1970s, when U.S. funding increased for alternate drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) that are expected soon to make the U.S. the world's largest energy producer. 
"We've come a long way," Leon Panetta, President Obama's Defense secretary from July 2011 to February 2013, tells USA TODAY, citing a push to diversify the U.S. energy portfolio. 
Henry Kissinger, who was President Nixon's secretary of State during the 1973 oil crisis, agrees. "We're better prepared now, by far," he told an energy conference last week in Washington, D.C. If Saudi Arabia cut its production and exports, he said the U.S. could buy elsewhere, adding: "They've lost the opportunity to blackmail us." 
STILL VULNERABLE 
Yet not all has changed. 
"We remain very vulnerable," Panetta says, adding it wouldn't take much for members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) -- which launched the 1973 embargo -- or terrorist groups like al-Qaeda to disrupt supplies. He says the U.S. is using less oil per capita than decades ago and relying on the Middle East for a smaller share of its imports, but those shifts almost don't matter. 
World oil prices, which largely determine what Americans pay at the pump, remain high, because developing countries, including China and India, are driving up demand. With global oil supplies so tight as a result, even a small disruption rattles the markets and causes price spikes. 
That's why, despite a 50% increase in U.S. oil production since 2008, the price for a regular gallon of gas remains so high. It costs, in inflation-adjusted dollars, twice as much as 40 years ago. 
"We're still part of a global oil market," says Daniel Yergin, oil historian and author of The Quest: Energy Security and the Remaking of the Modern World. He notes petroleum imports have fallen since their peak in 2005, when they accounted for 60% of what Americans used. But they've simply retreated to the same share of consumption as in 1973. 
The Department of Energy expects imports will continue to fall as U.S. oil production increases because of fracking. This controversial drilling process blasts huge quantities of water, mixed with sand and chemicals, underground to break apart shale formations and release oil as well as natural gas. 
"We won't become energy independent, but we'll become less energy dependent," Yergin says. 
That's not enough to inoculate the U.S. from future oil shocks. "Despite the domestic oil boom, America's oil security is only middle-of-the-road," Robbie Diamond of Securing America's Future Energy (SAFE), a non-partisan group aimed at reducing U.S. dependency, said this month in releasing a ranking of 13 countries' oil security. The United States ranked fifth best, after Japan (No. 1), United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. 
The report says the U.S. is making strides, including Obama's plan to nearly double the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks -- to 54 mpg -- by model year 2025. Still, regardless of efficiency gains, it says Americans use more oil than China, Japan and Russia combined, accounting for 20% of global consumption. 
"Our nation's oil dependence leaves the economy dangerously exposed to high and volatile oil prices," says Diamond, the group's chief executive officer. 
PARALLEL CLIMATE THREAT 
While an oil shock may rock the economy and influence U.S foreign policy, a parallel threat to the environment has emerged since the 1973 embargo: climate change. 
"That was not yet apparent," Kissinger said at the SAFE-organized conference, adding that even administration critics didn't voice concerns about oil use's environmental impact in the 1970s. 
In 1988, climate scientist James Hansen warned a Senate panel about the climate dangers posed by the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of oil, gas and coal. Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies have since shown that rising temperatures are increasing the risk and severity of heat waves, downpours, drought and wildfire. 
The United States can't go it alone any more on climate change than it can on the intertwined issue of oil. Case in point: Its carbon emissions are falling slightly in recent years, but global emissions -- largely because of China and India's use of oil and coal -- are soaring. 
Panetta says climate change adds to the reasons why the United States should lead world efforts to reduce reliance on oil. He says such dependence can "influence" decisions such as whether to wage war in the Persian Gulf, adding the U.S. would probably have imposed sanctions on Iran earlier if it weren't concerned about the impact on oil supplies. 
Yergin expects future energy disruptions, noting the Middle East is still in turmoil. He says although Saudi Arabia -- the center of the 1973 embargo -- is now America's strongest Arab ally, Iran is now an adversary. Forty years ago, Iran didn't participate in the embargo, because it was one of the strongest U.S. allies in the Middle East. 
"Americans have a short memory," Panetta says, adding they need to be reminded of the myriad costs and lingering risks associated with oil dependence -- as shown by the 1973 oil embargo.

Abstract 
While coal-fired power plants provided 18% of all energy consumed nationwide in 2012, they accounted for 31% of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

Full Text 
Lawsuits are expected to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to limit emissions from new power plants, and the main reason is cutting-edge, anti­pollution technology. 
As part of President Obama's plan to combat climate change, the EPA plans today to unveil its proposal to cap the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Coal-fired plants, unlike most natural gas facilities, won't meet the standard without costly technology to capture and store carbon emissions. 
No commercial, coal-fired plant worldwide has yet to use this technology, but at least two are now under construction -- one in Canada's Saskatchewan Province, and the other in Mississippi's Kemper County, which is scheduled to open in May. Three other U.S. coal plants are being planned, two in Texas and one in Illinois. 
The EPA's critics, including the coal industry, say it's not fair to require a technology that's not yet proved itself commercially. Yet, its supporters, including environmental groups, say the standard will create demand for the technology and spur industry clean-up. 
"There's no demand for the technology now," but an EPA rule will change that, says Dan Weiss of the Center for American Progress, a research group that supports the limits. He says there are enough demonstration projects to prove that the technology, often called CCS (carbon capture and sequestration), works. 
Not so, says Jeffrey Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell & Giuliani law firm who was a senior EPA official under President George W. Bush. "CCS has not been adequately demonstrated," says Holmstead, who represents coal-fired plants. "It's not met the standard EPA has used for the last 40 years" that requires that new technology also be cost-effective. 
"It's a gray area," says Howard Herzog of MIT's Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies program, begun in 1989. He says power plants can capture up to 90% of their carbon emissions with CCS. The process often has three phases. Carbon is captured and compressed, then transported (usually by pipeline) to a site where it's stored in deep underground rock formations. 
While coal-fired power plants provided 18% of all energy consumed nationwide in 2012, they accounted for 31% of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The EPA's proposal, which addresses only new power plants, is a dress rehearsal for a much larger one next year that will limit emissions from existing power plants. 
For new coal-fired plants, the EPA is expected to cap emissions at 1,100 pounds of carbon-dioxide pollution per megawatt-hour of power produced, Holmstead says, citing industry people who've been briefed on the standard. Existing coal-fired plants emit 1,800 to 2,100 pounds. In an earlier version last year, which the EPA has now revised, the agency proposed a limit of 1,000 pounds. 
Holmstead says the EPA's rule, which won't be finalized until next year, is "effectively a ban" on new coal-fired power plants. "I'm quite confident there will be a legal challenge," he says. "There's a good chance it will be overturned in court, but that's a few years away." 
Weiss agrees lawsuits will "absolutely" ensue, but he says the EPA is expected to give plants plenty of time to adjust. In the 2012 proposal, the EPA said plants could meet the standard by averaging emissions over 30 years, so even if they were higher in the first decade, they could make up for that later.

Abstract 
Just one set of new efficiency standards for refrigerators, dishwashers and other appliances will reduce carbon pollution by emissions equivalent to 25 coal-fired power plants. 

Full Text 
Increasing domestic oil and gas production is no panacea for our nation's energy needs or economy. That will only intensify our fossil fuel addiction. It also won't free us from the tyranny of the global oil market. U.S. oil production may be up 44% since 2008, but so are prices. The costs of crude oil have risen 6% in that time. 
And it is damaging communities' health, air, water and land. 
The fracking that is driving our oil and gas surge has grown at breakneck speed. Our public safeguards haven't kept pace. Companies have lobbied their way around bedrock environmental laws, and states have responded with weak rules and limited enforcement. 
When drill pads are built in our backyards and wild landscapes, these places become vulnerable to toxic chemicals, contaminated water and permanent scarring. 
We cannot continue down this path without safeguards that protect people, farms and communities from these threats. And we need to recognize that some places, such as those home to major drinking water supplies or rare landscapes, must be put off-limits. 
Also, more oil and gas production will only exacerbate climate change, the central environmental challenge of our time, imposing growing costs on our nation and imperiling our future. 
Last year alone, Americans suffered $140 billion in crop losses, wildfires, storm damage and other impacts of extreme weather made worse by climate change. The federal government picked up the lion's share of the tab at an average cost of $1,100 per taxpayer. 
America faces a choice. We can stand by and watch energy companies industrialize our communities and intensify climate change. Or we can pivot to a cleaner path. 
True energy independence means reducing our reliance on oil and gas by investing in America's abundant clean energy resources that can power our country and boost our economy without endangering our health and climate. 
The solar industry is 20 times the size it was a decade ago and employs more than 100,000 Americans. Just one set of new efficiency standards for refrigerators, dishwashers and other appliances will reduce carbon pollution by emissions equivalent to 25 coal-fired power plants. Our new 54.5 mpg fuel standards will cut oil imports by one-third and save consumers $1.7 trillion at the pump. 
These are the clean energy innovations that will lead us to a stronger economy, healthier communities and a safer planet. This is what it takes for America to be truly energy independent. 
Frances Beinecke is president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This will only get worse: Louisiana is shrinking as climate change softens up the already-vulnerable Gulf Coast

Abstract 
"Louisiana is in many ways, one of the best examples of starting to see some of the near-term implications of climate change," says environmental policy expert Jordan Fischbach, of the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Pittsburgh, part of the team that last year developed tools for the state to decide what coastal restoration projects to pursue.

Pelicans and pickups roam the beach, where the waves roll in and return, lapping over the open water of the Gulf of Mexico. 
The water covers land that was once beach, and it has devoured land that was once marsh tucked behind this 6-square-mile barrier island, a speed bump for hurricanes headed north from the Gulf. 
On this sunny day, the Tarpon Rodeo -- billed as "the oldest fishing tournament in the United States!" -- is underway, with fishing boats and truck-bed hot tubs competing in nearly equal numbers on the road. But beneath the sunshine here on the edge of this vanishing wetland, human mistakes are adding up. 
Indeed, the in-your-face transformation -- a product of climate change and the rewiring of the Mississippi -- is threatening the spawning grounds for much of the nation's seafood, the pit stop for the Gulf's oil industry and the home of the beloved bayous and fishing "camps" that make life here unlike anywhere else. With every bit of wetlands lost -- each day a football field's worth -- the people and places of the Gulf Coast become that much more vulnerable to the next hurricane. 
"I revel in every moment I'm out on the beaches, the bayous, the ponds," says Al Duvernay, 61, a life-long Louisianan. A retired oil industry worker, Duvernay now volunteers for efforts to rebuild the land sinking under the waves, a retreat he has seen firsthand over the course of a lifetime spent on the Mississippi River Delta. "Another part of me is compelled to come back here, because I know it is all going away." 
In the past eight decades, Louisiana has lost 1,880 square miles of coastal marshes, or an area about the size of Manhattan every year. With another hurricane season upon us, it is land that Louisiana and the nation can ill afford to lose. The same threat of lost barrier islands and wetlands stalks more than half of the coastal properties of the continental United States, extending from Maine to Texas. But here in southeastern Louisiana, it's at its worst. 
USA TODAY traveled to this place where the Mississippi meets the Gulf of Mexico as the sixth stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is changing lives. 
"The sea is rising and the land is sinking," says Louisiana's state climatologist, Barry Keim, based at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. "The two together mean that wetlands are disappearing here at unprecedented rates worldwide." Add in the threat of more powerful hurricanes spurred by climate change, Keim says, "and you have to worry about the past repeating itself here." 
"Louisiana is in many ways, one of the best examples of starting to see some of the near-term implications of climate change," says environmental policy expert Jordan Fischbach, of the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Pittsburgh, part of the team that last year developed tools for the state to decide what coastal restoration projects to pursue. "In some ways, I feel like it is the canary in the coal mine because they are seeing effects that change people's day-to-day lives." 
Cemeteries are sinking and washing away in towns like Leeville, La., on their way to becoming isolated spits of land. Onetime orange groves and cotton fields are waterlogged. 
Change here is constant but not subtle, so authorities have embarked on ambitious projects to, actually and figuratively, turn the tide. In May, the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) announced 39 projects it hoped to see reverse the damage, part of a 50-year, $50 billion plan. They range from restoring marshes to spilling fresh river water into the delta to rebuilding barrier islands. 
Every 3 miles of wetlands restored means 1 foot less of storm surge, the water wall pushed ahead of storm winds that is often one of the biggest killers in a hurricane, Keim says. "I worry a 50-year plan isn't enough, that it won't be enough," he says. "If we were talking about a 500-year plan, or a 1,000-year plan, that might be enough to bring things back." 
The storm surge in Hurricane Katrina reached a record 25 to 28 feet, where it hit hardest in Mississippi. It killed 1,200 people and caused $75billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
"Once you go through something like Katrina, you are never the same," says Duvernay, who spent the day after the storm in his fishing boat rescuing his neighbors, trapped in the upper floors of drowned homes. "You never want to see that again." 
MISSISSIPPI MISTAKE Driving along Louisiana State Highway 1, more a bridge than a road from New Orleans to Grand Isle, Hilary Collis of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana looks across wide-open lakes and estuaries, a few slivers of sand and mud dotted with marsh grass and short, squat mangrove trees. She then points to what isn't there anymore. 
"All the open water you are seeing was once wetlands," Collis says. "Just a few millimeters at a time it sank, and now it's gone." Unlike the vanished cypress trees that once dotted the marsh lining the bayou that parallels the highway, the mangroves have migrated from farther south, thriving in today's brackish water and warmer temperatures. 
How did it happen? For one thing, the Mississippi River has stopped doing its job: building wetlands. A massive levee program beginning in 1927 rerouted the Mississippi and put it "in a straitjacket," Keim says, kept its freshwater and mud from spreading across the Mississippi River Delta and replenishing the marshes. So without the silt, the marshes started to sink. 
"They turned off the sand and mud machine that built up the wetlands," is how Duvernay puts it. 
At the same time, the sea has risen about 7 inches globally in the past century, driven by climate change, alongside an increase of Earth's average surface temperature of more than 1.4 degrees. The increase is largely due to heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, boosting temperatures, according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. On the world's coasts, the result has been a change from the past 1,900 years of stability, as a warmer ocean expands and warmer air melts glaciers, leading to higher seas. 
Along Louisiana Highway 1, which carries travelers the last 60 miles from Lockport, La., to Grand Isle, the results are clear. Dead cypress trees killed by saltwater still stand in isolated spots, ringing ponds that have become brackish lakes. 
"I watched it all happen, places where I could fish and camp as a child are now just open water," Duvernay says. 
Keim, also a Louisiana native, sheepishly admits that he grew up as a child thinking that cypress trees just looked that way, dead. "It took a little education to figure out that the intrusion of saltwater had killed them all in the years before I was born," he says. 
Louisiana 1 is also the only road to Port Fourchon, the southernmost port in Louisiana, which supports 90% of the nation's offshore oil and gas rigs. Vulnerable to flooding, the highway is the key to 18% of the nation's oil production, according to January's draft of the federal National Climate Assessment report. "Every time there is a high tide or any storm, that road goes out," Fischbach says. 
And one final problem: Four major hurricanes -- Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Gustav (2008) and Ike (2011) -- have battered the region since 2005. Eroded, inundated, cut up by oil company canals and even gnawed to the roots by invasive South American rodents called nutria ("They eat marshland in its entirety," Keim says), the wetlands' ability to halt these goliaths' storm surges has been undermined. 
The same warming ocean waters that are slowly rising also look likely to deliver more powerful hurricanes to these shores. A 2010 Nature Geosciences study led by Thomas Knutson of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., concluded that future storms would be as much as 11% more intense in this century, dropping about 20% more rain within 60 miles of their center. 
On the plus side, global warming might mean that fewer storms form -- as many as 34% fewer -- in the years ahead. So we might see fewer, meaner storms, across the planet. Though the frequency question is one of the many unsettled areas of climate science, as some experts such as MIT's Kerry Emanuel predict a proliferation of storms with these warmer conditions. 
The debate matters not, Keim says. 
"We don't need to know the answer to look at the data and know that hurricanes have hit the Gulf Coast hard in the past," Keim says. "And the numbers tell us that where something has happened in the past, it will happen again." 
WHAT CAN BE DONE? 
Once a stomping ground of the pirate Jean Lafitte, Isle Grand Terre is a patch of sandy scrub curving before the Gulf of Mexico next to Grand Isle, a barrier island that shelters salty lagoons, marshes and bayous from the open sea. The island is home to five abandoned scientific buildings, the ruins of a Confederate fortress and mosquitoes that swarm visitors. It's also the home of a dune rebuilding project sponsored by local brewer Abita, which Al Duvernay volunteered for earlier this year. He and other helpers were brought in by barge in shifts to plant the dunes. 
"This is success," says Collis, pointing to a strip of dune grass stalks that extends several hundred yards along a newly installed beach fence, set about 40 yards back from the surf. Sand has already started to pile up against the fence, burying slats 2 inches deep, the start of a new dune guarding the beach. Volunteers had planted 18,000 stalks in the sand over two days in March, and now they stood erect, their roots bidding to become another bulwark against a future storm. 
"The idea is the dune and the dune grasses grow together, becoming larger and larger," Collis says. "If someday a hurricane comes and digs it all up then at least it will have done its job of taking some energy out of the storm." 
Even so, volunteer projects -- planting grasses on dunes, or mangroves in lagoons -- go only so far. The state coastal authority's industrial-scale projects are now beginning after more than two decades of planning, arguing and voting. They received overwhelming support last year from the state Legislature. Interestingly, the state's plan doesn't mention climate change; it just assumes it will happen. The estimated rise in sea levels form the backdrop against which projects are picked for priority. 
At Port Fourchon, just a few miles down from Grand Isle on the oft-flooded Louisiana 1, for example, a $5.4 million "Geotube" project now underway is stuffing 6-feet-wide fabric tubes with sand nearly a mile down the beach. 
But not everything is proceeding seamlessly. The fight over the coastal restoration plan has inevitably headed to the courts. Some oyster farmers are suing the state's coastal restoration project for Mississippi freshwater diversions that could harm oyster beds. The goal of the diversion is to restore delta-building sediment to sinking parts of the region and counter the saltwater creeping ever farther inland. 
The state's levee authority last month sued oil and gas companies for decades of cutting canals willy-nilly through wetlands and letting saltwater in from the Gulf. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, is disputing the levee authority's right to file the lawsuit. 
CROWDING THE COASTS 
Yet the legal issues often fold into the environmental ones, and those concerns lead to another place of concern along the U.S. coastlines: overdevelopment. About 39% of the 
U.S. population (works out to about 123 million people) now live in shoreline counties, according to Census data. The deluxe camps on Grand Isle -- seemingly almost daring the next hurricane's wrath -- are just one symptom of this rush to the coast 
"Global warming doesn't make people buy beachfront condos," Keim says, pointing to another piece of the hurricane dilemma. 
A quiet period for hurricanes that ended in the 1990s lured the nation toward beach living, sparking a coastal construction boom that is still underway. From Louisiana's camps and vacation homes perched high on stilt-like piers, to New Jersey's shore towns, Americans still can't get enough of warm waves and soft sand and are often undaunted by the dangers building on our coasts. 
Those who are taking up this fight, though, see a silver lining in these dark clouds. 
"I am happier than I have been in a long time that some places will be saved," Duvernay says. 
He cites not his own volunteer efforts, or his fishing habit, but the realization that officials are starting to pay attention to this changing world. 
"I'm happier there is a plan with some funding," Duvernay says, "but I still worry it might be too little, too late."

Abstract 
"Cuccinelli in some ways has abused his position in pursuit of his ideological agenda, whether it is suing a climate scientist at the University of Virginia or suing the universities to get them to stop enforcing anti-discrimination measures against gays and lesbians," says pollster Geoffrey Garin, a strategist for McAuliffe. 

Full Text 
The politician doing the most to shape the Virginia governor's race isn't on the ballot. 
The cascading ethical travails of Gov. Bob McDonnell have overshadowed the efforts of the two men who want to succeed him -- Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe -- in a campaign with national repercussions that has taken a sharply negative turn on its own. 
"It dominates the coverage, which makes it harder to talk to people about growing jobs and about a positive vision for Virginia," Cuccinelli told USA TODAY in an interview. He acknowledged making "my own mistakes in terms of disclosure" involving gifts from the political donor behind the scandal but called them oversights that have been remedied and denied any wrongdoing. 
"You hear chatter about it when you're on the trail," McAuliffe, who headed the Democratic National Committee and co-chaired President Clinton's re-election campaign, agreed in a separate interview. "It's there, but what people want to know about is the huge challenges" facing the next governor, from education to traffic congestion. 
The two candidates are slated to square off Saturday at their first campaign debate, sponsored by the Virginia Bar Association at a tony resort in Hot Springs, Va. Their contest is being watched as test of the mood of voters on the issues such as the Affordable Care Act and immigration before the midterm elections that follow next year. 
Four years ago, for instance, McDonnell's election was an early sign of the voter unhappiness with President Obama and the health care debate that led to devastating Democratic setbacks in 2010, including the loss of control of the House of Representatives. 
Still, it's hard for position papers to compete with the drip-drip-drip of disclosures since March in The Washington Post and elsewhere about the $25,000 that Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams provided to pay for the weddings of McDonnell's daughters; the $6,500 Rolex watch he bought for McDonnell's wife to give the governor; the $15,000 shopping spree he financed for her at Bergdorf Goodman, and the $70,000 he provided to a company owned by the governor and his sister. (Williams also gave Cuccinelli $18,000 worth of gifts, and the attorney general made a profit on stock in his company.) 
The federal and state investigations into McDonnell reflect a remarkable fall from grace for the Republican governor, whose political future seemed limitless last year. He was mentioned as a running mate for Mitt Romney in 2012 and seen as a potential 2016 presidential candidate himself. Now some Virginia Democrats are calling for his resignation. 
It is also unfamiliar political terrain for the Old Dominion. No sitting Virginia governor has been involved in such a serious scandal in modern times, says political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia. That contrasts with New Jersey, the only other state holding a gubernatorial election in November. There, Gov. Chris Christie brags that as 
U.S. attorney for seven years he convicted or got guilty pleas from 130 New Jersey pols on bribery, fraud, tax evasion and other charges. 
Christie is rated by the non-partisan Cook Political Report as likely to win a second term this fall, and he's touted as a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016. 
In Virginia, though, the governor's race is a tossup. The Roanoke College Poll, taken July 8 through Sunday and released Wednesday, put Cuccinelli ahead, 37%-31%. A survey taken last Thursday through Sunday by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling gave McAuliffe the edge, 41%-37%. Both leads were within the polls' margins of error. 
OUT OF MAINSTREAM? 
McAuliffe and Cuccinelli have national reputations that are assets and issues: Cuccinelli as a crusader on abortion, climate change and other conservative social causes, McAuliffe as a premier Democratic fundraiser and pal of the Clintons. Each portrays the other as out of the mainstream for what in recent years has become a swing state. Virginia, which had been safely Republican in presidential elections since 1968, voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. 
"Cuccinelli in some ways has abused his position in pursuit of his ideological agenda, whether it is suing a climate scientist at the University of Virginia or suing the universities to get them to stop enforcing anti-discrimination measures against gays and lesbians," says pollster Geoffrey Garin, a strategist for McAuliffe. "If Cuccinelli were elected, he would be the most right-wing governor in recent memory, with the possible exception of Sarah Palin." 
Democratic TV ads hammer Cuccinelli. In an ad released this week and paid for by the state party, a retiree frets about Cuccinnelli's views in a book published this year stating that Social Security and Medicare have helped make Americans "dependent on government." "It scares me to think of Ken Cuccinelli as governor," she said. "I think he is way out of touch with everybody." 
Cuccinelli, meanwhile, portrays McAuliffe as a classic liberal with few deep ties to Virginia. 
"I think if Virginians knew where Terry actually stood on taxpayer funding for abortion, for abortion up to the moment of birth, for sex-selection abortion at the option (of the woman) -- those are things that I think that Virginia voters would find to be unacceptable to them," Cuccinelli said in the interview. He charged that McAuliffe had a "rather tawdry political history" as a fundraiser. And he noted that he has released the past eight years of his tax returns, while his opponent has not. 
McAuliffe in April did release three years of abridged returns that showed he had made $16.5 million in 2009 through 2011 and paid almost $4 million in taxes. 
Perhaps more problematic for McAuliffe has been scrutiny of his business record, which he has boasted gives him the credentials to create jobs and boost the economy in the state. Since losing the 2009 nomination for governor, McAuliffe helped found GreenTech Automotive, an electric car company, and Franklin Pellets, a manufacturer of wood pellets used by power plants. 
Neither company has taken off in a way that would create a significant number of jobs. GreenTech ended up deciding to locate its manufacturing plant in Mississippi. McAuliffe revealed in April that he had stepped down as the company's chairman in December. 
In a tour last week at the RagingWire Data Center in Ashburn, Va., McAuliffe didn't mention his own business ventures as he quizzed executives there about how the state government could help draw more high-skilled private-sector jobs to Virginia, studiously scribbling notes and numbers in a reporter-style notebook he was carrying. 
"I can say all these businesses, they don't want a social, ideological agenda coming from their governor," McAuliffe told the four reporters traipsing after him in hard hats and safety vests as he admired the construction of a giant cage to secure computer servers. "To bring businesses from California, you cannot have attacks on women or gay Virginians or whoever that may be." 
McAuliffe, 56, is a big, bluff presence, insisting as he leaves on trying out the retinal-scan security system. "Sorry, cannot confirm your identity," the computerized voice responds. He laughs in delight. 
Two days earlier, Cuccinelli also was talking jobs and the economy as he toured the Holly, Woods and Vine garden center in Alexandria on a sweltering afternoon. He asked the proprietor, Vanessa Wheeler, about the impact of the federal budget cuts known as sequestration on her customers, including federal workers who have had furloughs and employees of defense contractors that are facing cutbacks. 
Pausing in the shade of a gazebo, standing next to a 5-foot-tall statue of Buddha, he parried questions from reporters about McDonnell's troubles and McAuliffe's attacks. At 44, he is a trim man with short graying hair and a no-nonsense manner. 
"I would say that what Terry McAuliffe has called a success, his GreenTech chairmanship and his Franklin Pellets chairmanship, are failures, and Virginians can judge that themselves," Cuccinelli replied. "For a long, long time in this race, he said, 'My job-creation performance here is why you should elect me governor.' He's not saying that anymore." 
TRIAL OF THE CHEF 
History favors Cuccinelli. Virginia, the only state to limit governors to a single term, has given a political party at least two consecutive terms in the governor's mansion in every election since the 1880s. McDonnell in 2009 succeeded Democrat Tim Kaine, now a U.S. senator. 
This time, though, McDonnell's troubles make it hard for him to help Cuccinelli, or for Cuccinelli to want his embrace. And the scandal is sure to be in the news during the campaign's final push. Todd Schneider, a former chef at the Virginia executive mansion, is scheduled to go on trial Oct. 15 on felony charges of embezzling state money. His attorneys say he alerted officials about Williams' gifts to the McDonnell family. 
With four months to Election Day, McAuliffe has a big money advantage. On Monday, he reported raising nearly $2 million in June, close to double the $1.1 million Cuccinelli raised. McAuliffe now has $6 million in the bank; Cuccinelli, $2.7 million. 
But Cuccinelli may have an advantage in the intensity of support in a contest that traditionally has low voter turnout. "Look, there's a base of committed voters for Ken Cuccinelli that is much more motivated for him than the current base of the Democrat Party is willing to turn out and vote for Terry," says Chris LaCivita, a strategist for Cuccinelli who gained fame as an architect of the Swift Boat Veterans attacks on John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign. 
McAuliffe said the old rules of Virginia may no longer apply. "It's a different electorate today; President Obama won the state twice," he said in the interview. But asked about turnout, he replied, "You hit the nail right on the head. No question that's what it's about. The goal has to be to get those voters to turn out." 
It's too early to know for sure, Cuccinelli said, but the race could turn out to be a referendum in Virginia on Obama's signature Affordable Care Act and federal environmental regulations that are feared by the state's coal industry, both policies that he has opposed as attorney general. 
"Those push back opportunities on the federal government's overreach do play a role in this race," Cuccinelli said. 
By November, the campaigns, interest groups and super PACS will have spent tens of millions of dollars on the race, Sabato predicts. "Everybody's going to be spending."

DOE: Climate change will disrupt energy supply: Power lines less efficient in higher temperatures

Abstract 
Reduced snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains last year cut California's hydroelectric power generation by 8%, while drought caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop transporting oil and coal along the Mississippi River, where water levels were too low. 

Full Text 
U.S. energy supplies will likely face more severe disruptions because of climate change and extreme weather, which have already caused blackouts and lowered production at power plants, a government report warned Thursday. 
What's driving these vulnerabilities? Rising temperatures, up 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, and the resulting sea level rise, which are accompanied by drought, heat waves, storms and wildfires, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
"It (climate change) is a very serious problem, and it will get worse," says Jonathan Pershing, who oversaw the report's development. While impacts will vary by region, "no part of the country is immune," he says. 
"Sea level rise made Sandy worse," intensifying flooding, Pershing says. When the superstorm slammed the East Coast last year, it took down power lines, damaged power plants and left millions in the dark. 
The report comes one week after President Obama, describing climate change as a threat to future generations, called for action to address the problem "before it's too late." He said he aims to cut heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing power plants. 
Echoing other research, the DOE report makes the case for why such reductions are needed. It says coastal power plants are at risk from sea level rise and power lines operate less efficiently in higher temperatures. 
"The report accurately outlines the risks to the energy sector" and should serve as a "wake-up call," says Jennifer Morgan, deputy director of climate and energy at the World Resources Institute, a non-profit that advocates for sustainability. 
The report cites prior disruptions. Last year in Connecticut, the Millstone Nuclear Power Station shut down one reactor because the temperature of water needed to cool the facility - from the Long Island Sound - was too high. A similar problem caused power reductions in 2010 at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey and Limerick Generating Station in Pennsylvania. 
Reduced snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains last year cut California's hydroelectric power generation by 8%, while drought caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop transporting oil and coal along the Mississippi River, where water levels were too low. In September 2010, water levels in Nevada's Lake Mead fell to a 54-year low, prompting a 23% loss in the Hoover Dam's generation. 
While climate change is not the sole cause of drought, scientists say rising temperatures can cause more moisture to evaporate from the soil. They say those temperatures, which the third federal National Climate Assessment says could rise 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, will contribute more to drought in the future. 
In Texas, which is suffering a three-year drought that now affects 87% of its land, conflicts are arising over the water-intensive process of extracting oil or natural gas from shale deposits, known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2011, Grand Prairie banned city water for fracking. Other municipalities have restricted water use for that purpose. 
Nationwide, 47% of fracking wells are in water-stressed areas, says a report by Ceres, a Boston non-profit. 
The DOE report cites research indicating that nearly 60% of current thermoelectric power plants, which need water cooling to operate, are located in water-stressed areas. 
It says higher temperatures will boost demand for air conditioning, which could threaten energy security by forcing the nation's power system to operate beyond ranges for which it was designed. It cites a study by DOE's Argonne National Laboratory that found such peak demand, given current population levels, will require additional electricity equal to 100 new power plants. 
The dire tone of the DOE report, while warranted, can "give a reader a sense of fatigue," says Joe Casola, a senior scientist at C2ES, formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Yet he says it also points to solutions, such as water-efficient technologies and protection for energy infrastructure. 
"It's technologically within our means to address some of these issues now," Casola says. "There are a lot of things we can do." 
Pershing agrees: "It's a problem we need to work on." He says the billions of dollars in losses already incurred from climate-related disasters show the need for additional measures.

Obama group targets energy: Non-profit helps push White House's climate-change plan

Abstract 
The group's energy activism comes as the White House tries to sell a sweeping climate-change plan that circumvents Congress after failing to get lawmakers to pass legislation that curbs the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. 

Full Text 
As President Obama pushes an aggressive national climate-change plan, his administration's non-profit advocacy arm is becoming active in clean-energy drives across the country. 
Organizing for Action (OFA) also has formed a partnership that steers its volunteers to purchase wind and solar power from a single company with ties to liberal groups. 
"While we are doing all of this work to advance the president's agenda in Congress, we also want to do everything we can locally to help switch to clean energy," said Ivan Frishberg, Organizing for Action's climate-change manager. 
Organizing for Action, for instance, will recommend that its volunteers and activists who want to purchase renewable energy for their homes and businesses consider signing up with Ethical Electric, a firm that currently sells wind power in four Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia and bills itself as a socially responsible energy supplier. It also has licenses that will allow it to expand to New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and Ohio. 
Organizing for Action's leaders "are trying to show people that it's easy to make a change," said Tom Matzzie, the president of Ethical Electric and a former Washington director of the liberal group MoveOn.org Political Action. "It's an important role they can play in mobilizing people to participate in the clean-energy economy." 
Organizing for Action officials say the group is not accepting money from Ethical Electric. Instead, Matzzie said, OFA is directing the sign-up bonus that Ethical Electric offers to all new partners to another nonprofit -- Community Power Network -- which helps schools, neighborhood groups and other local organizations push for renewable energy. 
Meredith McGehee, who examines government ethics at the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group, questions whether it's appropriate for an organization so closely linked to a sitting president to develop ties with one business. 
"You can say that developing clean energy is great, but do competitors feel the weight of the presidency being used to undermine their business model?" she said. "It raises questions about the ethical propriety of the use of the president's bully pulpit." 
Organizing for Action has no real precedent in American politics. The non-profit, run by former campaign and White House aides, has the goal of mobilizing Obama's legions of 2012 campaign volunteers to advance the president's second-term agenda on immigration, gun control, climate change and other issues. 
OFA counts 2.6 million people as having taken at least one action on behalf of the president's agenda this year -- ranging from attending a rally to promoting immigration changes in Congress to making a financial contribution. The group, which can raise unlimited amounts of money, collected nearly $5 million during the first three months of the year. 
The group's energy activism comes as the White House tries to sell a sweeping climate-change plan that circumvents Congress after failing to get lawmakers to pass legislation that curbs the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. 
Under the plan unveiled last week, Obama is using his executive powers to impose new limits on carbon-dioxide emissions by new and existing power plants. The plan also increases energy-efficiency standards and boosts the production of renewable energy on federal land. 
Environmental groups largely applauded the move, while Republicans and some Democrats say the action is another sign of what they call the president's "war on coal." 
Two months ago, OFA took aim at lawmakers who disagree with the president, launching a "climate deniers" website that singles out more than 100 members of Congress. 
At the local level, the group has paired with environmental groups in Northern California and in Illinois to encourage county and city governments to add more renewable energy to the available electricity options. 
Next week, for instance, OFA volunteers plan to help urge the Santa Rosa City Council, north of San Francisco, to vote to join Sonoma Clean Power, a new public agency with the power to purchase renewable energy from electricity suppliers. Sonoma County officials and two cities within the county already have opted in to the new agency, which would displace Pacific Gas and Electric as the main electricity provider. Pacific Gas and Electric still would distribute the electricity and handle billing.

President Obama unveiled a new plan to address climate change, seeking new global agreements and taking measures to reduce carbon pollution at home. 
Many are going to lose their jobs because of President Obama's plan. We aren't a bad polluter now compared with what we used to be. Plus, we are nothing in comparison with 

the newly industrialized countries. This plan is just the president's continued desire for more government regulation. 
Obama is detrimental to this country's future. 
Andrew Goetz 
Coal and oil have ruined our rivers for a long time. Now our beautiful mountains in West Virginia are about gone to provide energy to keep the lights on. 
Gary Allen 
It may be me, but wouldn't it seem logical to assist coal companies with a phase-out and phase-in policy of old to new technologies? A coal company is going to reject anything 

that threatens its livelihood. Compromise is the key to a legacy, not mandates. 
Edward W Greenlee 
Great idea: Replace coal with natural gas. Natural gas is, of course, the result of "fracking." 
Next speech for Obama: pandering to the anti-fracking crowd. 
Henk Vandenbergh 
LETTERS 
Millions of Americans who work in clean energy-related businesses would take issue with Bjorn Lomborg's claim that clean energy has a marginal role in addressing climate 

change ("Obama should confront climate change fantasies," Opinion, Wednesday). 

Renewable energy production has doubled in the last four years. Some states now get 20% of their electricity from renewables. Yet the U.S. is still catching up to other countries, such as Lomborg's native Denmark, which gets 40% of its electricity from renewables. Recent U.S. efficiency standards for everything from refrigerators to industrial motors will help cut carbon pollution by 100 million metric tons by 2035 and save Americans $77 
billion on energy bills, while driving innovation and economic growth. It's no fantasy. Renewable energy is making a difference. Dale Bryk, director; energy and transportation program; Natural Resources Defense Council New York

After President Obama laid out his plan to address climate change, we asked our Twitter followers: What should be done about the environment? 
How about a plan to cut oil use in half? We can do it with today's technology and smart policy. 
@UCSRachel 
Climate change can be fought with carbon tax on fossil fuels plus offset with income tax. It's simple. GOP Congress won't consider it. 
@jamespettit4 
Go green. Turn AC off. Open windows. Use clothes lines to dry laundry instead of a dryer. 
@Hplage44 
We need to switch to green energy as fast as we can: natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear energy. Kill out coal and oil.

In an era of extreme weather, inaction is a bad bet

Abstract 
Leaving much to the Environmental Protection Agency, he would put limits on carbon emissions for new and existing plants, a move that would inevitably hasten the shift away from coal. 

Full Text 
Scientists say that no particular extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change, but global warming "loads the dice" by making such events more likely. 
So is it coincidence that Talkeetna, in interior Alaska, hit a record 96 degrees last week? Or that Las Vegas could break its all-time high of 117 degrees this weekend? 
No one knows for sure, but this much is indisputable: The climate is changing. New high temperature records are far outstripping record lows. And, as President Obama spelled out in his climate plan this week, it's long past time to stop gambling with the planet's future. 
Ideally, Obama and Congress would work together to address the threat by putting a price on climate-altering carbon pollution. But since that's as likely as a July 4 Washington blizzard, Obama's approach represents the next best option. 
Obama's plan builds on one of the most unnoticed trends in the United States over the past several years: the drop in carbon emissions. From levels of 2005, they are down roughly 12%. This drop is not enough to meet the goal of 17% by 2020 that the president set four years ago. It is also being offset by increases elsewhere in the world. And some of it is the result of a weak economy. 
But the drop does point the way forward. Much of the decline was driven by cheap and relatively clean natural gas, which power producers have been switching into in place of coal. Not surprisingly, coal-fired plants are at the heart of Obama's plan. Leaving much to the Environmental Protection Agency, he would put limits on carbon emissions for new and existing plants, a move that would inevitably hasten the shift away from coal. 
This isn't popular in places such as West Virginia. And it might not be exactly what some environmentalists want to hear, because most of the replacement for coal is likely to be natural gas from fracking, and not renewables such as wind and solar, which are almost sure to remain niche energy sources for some time. 
But the time for delicately dancing around the subject of coal's contribution to climate change is over. The highly polluting fuel is the low hanging fruit in any plan to combat climate change. It produces about twice as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as natural gas (and massively more than nuclear, wind and solar). 
Critics focus on higher utility prices from new regulations on coal plants, but they ignore the enormous costs of rising oceans and hotter, more turbulent weather. New York City alone has already proposed $20billion in flood walls and storm barriers to gird itself against a changing climate. 
The most challenging part of any climate change plan, of course, is not in replacing coal or shoring up defenses against rising sea levels. Rather, it is getting the rest of the world -- particularly China and India -- to commit to meaningful greenhouse-gas reductions. 
That's as much a diplomatic challenge as a scientific one. But unless the United States leads, others will be slow to follow, and the earth's outlook will remain a crapshoot.

Abstract 
The report by the National Research Council (NRC) arrived on the same day that Obama unveiled his second-term climate agenda, which includes efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and boost energy efficiency as well as renewable power. 

Full Text 
A congressionally mandated report Tuesday says the type of oil that would flow through the controversial Keystone XL pipeline is no more likely than other crude oil to cause pipeline failure, a finding that undercuts one reason environmentalists say President Obama should reject the billion-dollar project. 
The report by the National Research Council (NRC) arrived on the same day that Obama unveiled his second-term climate agenda, which includes efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and boost energy efficiency as well as renewable power. 
Environmental groups are waging an intense but uphill fight against the Keystone project. They say the northern leg of the pipeline, which would carry tar or oil sands from Canada's Alberta region to the U.S. Midwest, will trigger an unnecessary surge in greenhouse gas emissions and more pipeline leaks because of tar sands' higher corrosiveness than other crude oils. 
The report from NRC, the principle operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, concurs with an earlier State Department review on the risks posed by diluted bitumen, the form in which tar sands is transmitted by pipeline. 
"There's nothing extraordinary about pipeline shipments of diluted bitumen to make them more likely than other crude oils to cause releases," Mark Barteau, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Michigan and chair of the committee that wrote the report, said in announcing the findings. 
Bitumen, which is dense and as viscous as cold molasses, only flows through pipelines when diluted with lighter oils. Such diluted bitumen has been imported from western Canada for more than 30 years. 
After a massive 2011 spill of tar sands in Michigan's Kalamazoo River, the Natural Resources Defense Council reviewed U.S. pipeline data. The environmental group found that pipelines in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, which have carried diluted bitumen since the late 1990s, spilled 3.6 times as much crude per mile than the national average from 2010 to 2012. 
The new NRC study adds weight to pro-Keystone arguments, which got a boost from the State Department review. The department said denying the Keystone XL permit would have no impact on climate change because oil sands would be developed anyway. 
Yet there's dissension within Obama's administration. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a letter calling the State Department review "insufficient" and asked for more analyses of spill risks, alternative pipeline routes and possible dangers of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project. 
In January 2012, Obama rejected the initial 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Port Arthur, Texas, saying he needed more time for environmental review. 
Calgary-based TransCanada, its operator, then split the project into two parts and offered a revised route for the northern leg that avoids some environmentally sensitive areas in Nebraska. It received approval last year from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin the 485-mile, $2.3billion southern leg from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast.

Coal exports increase: Industry adjusts to weaker market

Abstract 
Popovich says Obama's new proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants will do little to help the climate, because increasing amounts of coal are being burned worldwide. 

Full Text 
The U.S. coal industry, under increasing pressure at home after President Obama's call Tuesday for tougher anti-pollution rules, is ratcheting up a more promising part of its 
business: exports. 
Coal exports set a monthly record in March, driven largely by rising demand from its top customer -- China -- and other Asian countries, according to the most recent data from 
the Energy Information Administration. 

While domestic consumption has had recent dips, exports have steadily climbed -- from 39.6 million short tons in 2002 to a record 125.7 million short tons last year. 
"Many coal producers are looking offshore as a way to offset softer markets in the United States," says Luke Popovich, spokesman of the National Mining Association. 
Popovich says Obama's new proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants will do little to help the climate, because increasing amounts of coal are 

being burned worldwide. 

As part of his plan to tackle climate change, Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday to work with states and industry to develop carbon pollution 
standards for existing power plants. His administration proposed such limits for new plants last year but delayed issuing final rules in April. 
"We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water, but power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into 

the air for free. That's not right, that's not safe, and it needs to stop," Obama said in a speech at Georgetown University. He said technological advances can help reduce 

pollution by capturing and storing carbon so it's not emitted into the air. 
Obama said the United States can't go it alone. "I'm calling for an end of public financing for new coal plants overseas -- unless they deploy carbon-capture technologies. I urge 
other countries to join this effort," he said, adding that his administration will launch talks to help other countries build a low-carbon economy. 

Environmentalists, who had been pressuring Obama to do more on climate change, welcomed his remarks. 

"Power plants need to be cleaned up," says David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sought rules on existing plants in a report this year. His group says 
power plants account for 40% of the nation's carbon footprint. 
"This is a no-brainer opportunity," Hawkins says, adding that Obama has the authority under the Clean Air Act to limit greenhouse gas emissions and thus doesn't need 

Congress' approval. 
The coal industry criticized Obama's plan, saying additional regulations could raise energy prices and shutter more power plants. 
"If the Obama administration fails to recognize the environmental progress the industry has made and continues to adopt more regulations, coal power could cease to exist, 

which would be devastating for our economy," Robert Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said in a statement. 
His group says 15% of plants plan to close because of existing EPA rules and more will be forced to follow under new limits. 
Coal faces a rosier future abroad. Its demand will increase in every region of the world except in the USA, according to a December report by the International Energy Agency. It 

provides 40% of the world's electricity, similar to its U.S. share.

Abstract 
[...]we need innovation in long-term green energy, which the president wants to fund with $7.9 billion for fiscal 2014. 

Full Text 
President Obama's new climate policies outlined Tuesday include both brilliant and useless ideas. The confusion stems from his unwillingness to confront three climate fantasies: uRenewables are a major part of the solution today. No, they are almost trivial. Today, the world gets 81% of its energy from fossil fuels. By 2035, in the most green scenario, we will still get 79% from fossil fuels. Wind and solar will increase from 0.8% to 3.2% impressive, but not what is going to matter. uBiofuels should play a major part of the solution. No. For now, biofuels simply diverts food into cars, driving up food prices and starvation, while clearing forests for new fields emit more CO2 than biofuels save. uEfficiency can cut emissions. No. Though efficiency is good, studies show it has little climate impact because its savings gets eaten up by more use. As your car gets more efficient, you drive it further, and the 
money you still save get used for other 
carbon-emitting activities. But carefully implemented, Obama's plan also shows the way to the three climate truths. Fracking is this decade's green solution. Obama recognizes gas as a "bridge fuel." Replacing dirtier coal, cheaper gas from fracking has cut up to 500 megatons of the U.S. CO2 emissions a year. This is about 10 times more than what renewables do, and while renewables cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars, fracking has saved the U.S. consumer $125 billion annually in cheaper energy prices. Fracking has local environmental issues, but these can all be addressed with good regulation. Moving the U.S. fracking miracle to the rest of the world will be the biggest source of CO2 reductions this decade, and simultaneously increase global welfare by allowing energy access to billions yet unserved. Adaptation is smart, and Obama is right to stress it. Wetlands, tidal barriers and subway caps could have dramatically reduced Hurricane Sandy's impact, irrespective of how little global warming impacted the superstorm. There are many more smart and cheap solutions to real world problems. Finally, we need innovation in long-term green energy, which the president wants to fund with $7.9 billion for fiscal 2014. As long as green energy is much more expensive than fossil fuels, it will always remain a niche, subsidized by rich countries to feel good. But if innovation makes future green energy sources cheaper than fossil fuels, everyone will switch. Just like the 30­year Energy Department research into fracking made cleaner gas cheaper than coal and produced a historic U.S. CO2 reduction, twice that of the European Union/Kyoto reduction. The final climate fantasy Obama needs to confront is the idea that international negotiations can somehow bring about meaningful cuts. We've tried this for more than 20 years and failed, and we will fail again in 2015 in Paris. More than 180 countries won't meaningfully reduce CO2 emissions from the fossil fuels that power their economic growth. The president should instead ask the rest of the world to follow the U.S. lead on green innovation. Economic models show that this is by far the best, long-term climate policy. If we all invested far more to innovate down the cost of future green energy, we could out-compete fossil fuels faster and truly solve global warming.

Abstract 
In discussing efforts to reduce carbon pollution, Obama said he would direct the Interior Department to permit new wind, solar and other renewable energy projects on public lands, enough to power more than 6million homes by 2020. 

Full Text 
President Obama said Tuesday that his State Department should not sign off on the Keystone XL oil pipeline if it increases greenhouse gas emissions. 
"Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution," Obama said during a major address on global 
warming at Georgetown University. 
He made the statement on a warm day in Washington while outlining his new "climate action plan." 
It includes new rules to restrict what the president called "the limitless dumping" of carbon pollution from power plants, as well as the promotion of renewable energy sources 

and new energy-efficiency standards. 

Obama said he would direct agencies to help brace the nation for existing effects of climate change, including hotter temperatures and stronger storms. He also pledged to seek 
new global agreements on climate change. 
Warning that climate change threatens future generations, Obama told his college audience that "the question is not whether we need to act the question now is whether we will 

have the courage to act before it's too late." 

In discussing efforts to reduce carbon pollution, Obama said he would direct the Interior Department to permit new wind, solar and other renewable energy projects on public 
lands, enough to power more than 6million homes by 2020. 
Almost all of the president's plan involves executive actions that do not require congressional approval. 
Republicans and members of the energy industry criticized Obama's climate change plan, saying it will lead to higher utility bills and less development of reliable energy. 
The policies "will shutter power plants, destroy good-paying American jobs and raise electricity bills for families that can scarcely afford it," House Speaker John Boehner, R-

Ohio, said. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Obama's plan is a "war on coal" that translates to a "war on jobs." 
Congressional Republicans are also major backers of the Keystone pipeline, saying it will create jobs and increase the nation's energy supply. The project is being reviewed by 

the State Department because it crosses the U.S.-Canadian border. 

Although Obama and aides said the State Department is making an independent judgment, Obama told the crowd at Georgetown that "the net effects of the pipeline's impact 
on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward." 
Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck cited studies showing that the pipeline would not affect oil development in the Canadian tar sands and would have little environmental effect. 

"The standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline," Buck said. 
Obama pledged to work with any willing Republicans but repeatedly criticized GOP members for ignoring or disputing the science behind climate change. 
"We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society," Obama said at one point. 
Obama also disputed the Republican contention that environmental and climate regulations hurt the economy, saying they can actually encourage growth and innovation. 
Environmental groups rallied around Obama's plan. 
"Americans are already dealing with worse droughts, wildfires and coastal floods, and the practical realities of climate change are forcing political leaders to make this a priority," 

said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Abstract 
According to the White House blueprint, Obama will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to work with states, industry and other stakeholders to establish new carbon pollution standards for new and existing plants. 

Full Text 
President Obama plans to announce new rules today to restrict carbon pollution at new and existing power plants, part of what he calls a comprehensive plan to combat climate change. 
In a speech at Georgetown University, Obama will also direct the Interior Department to permit new wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects on public lands, enough to power 6-million-plus homes by 2020. 
New energy-efficiency projects are also part of the climate change plan, according to a blueprint provided by the White House. 
In a video announcing the speech, Obama said he would lay out "a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare our country for the impacts of climate change and lead global efforts to fight it." 
Although "no single step" can reverse the existing effects of climate change, Obama said that "when it comes to the world we leave our children, we owe it to them to do what we can." He also will outline plans to prepare the nation for the impact of global warming and to seek new international agreements to address climate change on a global scale, the blueprint says. 
Most of the climate change plan involves executive actions that don't require congressional approval. The president could have a difficult time getting his environmental agenda through Congress, given a U.S. House run by Republicans and a Senate in which the GOP has enough members to mount effective filibusters. 
Republicans and members of the energy industry are likely to criticize Obama's climate change plan, saying it will lead to higher utility bills and less development of reliable energy. 
The president is not expected to discuss another major environmental issue in his speech: the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada into the U.S., a project still under review by the State Department. 
According to the White House blueprint, Obama will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to work with states, industry and other stakeholders to establish new carbon pollution standards for new and existing plants. He also plans to direct federal agencies to help state and local governments with existing problems caused by climate change -­such as improved flood protection for roads and other infrastructure, better hospitals to respond to increasingly powerful storms, and drought relief. 
Calling for action on climate change in his State of the Union Address on Feb. 12, Obama said that "some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms." 
As part of a global approach to climate change, Obama plans to call for an end of federal support for public financing of new coal-fired plants overseas. Exceptions would be made "for the most efficient coal technology available in the world's poorest countries, or facilities deploying carbon capture and sequestration technologies," according to the blueprint.

Abstract 
[...]coal isn't always clean-burning, and natural gas, while cleaner, still has carbon emissions blamed for climate change. [...]the DOE calculation shines a very bright light on the cheap fuel vs. clean fuel dilemma that has some saying there should be greater environmental concern about power plants before rushing headlong into electric cars. "Gasoline vehicle efficiency is already improving by nearly 4% per year, while emissions from U.S. electric power generation are not even declining by 1% per year," says John DeCicco, a research professor at the University of Michigan Energy Institute and professor at the School of Natural Resources. 

Full Text 
The government created a stir this week when it said that the power to run an electric vehicle costs only about one-third as much as the cost of gasoline to power a similar vehicle for the same distance. 
While that was celebrated by backers of electric cars and plug-in gas-electric hybrids, the Energy Department formula deals only with fuel cost. It leaves out some key financial and environmental factors that should be considered in owning an electric vehicle. 
The government's formula, which adjusts as fuel prices do, said Wednesday that owners of electrified vehicles would spend an average $1.14 to go as far as owners of gasoline cars do on one gallon of gas, which averages about $3.63 nationwide, according to travel consultant AAA. 
Electric cars' low equivalent fuel cost is because of cheap electricity to recharge batteries. It's cheap because about two-thirds of it in the U.S. is generated by burning low-cost coal and natural gas. But coal isn't always clean-burning, and natural gas, while cleaner, still has carbon emissions blamed for climate change. 
Thus, the DOE calculation shines a very bright light on the cheap fuel vs. clean fuel dilemma that has some saying there should be greater environmental concern about power plants before rushing headlong into electric cars. 
"Gasoline vehicle efficiency is already improving by nearly 4% per year, while emissions from U.S. electric power generation are not even declining by 1% per year," says John DeCicco, a research professor at the University of Michigan Energy Institute and professor at the School of Natural Resources. "If you think that electric cars will be needed someday, you first have to greatly cut carbon emissions from power generation." 
The DOE also does not address plug-in car financial issues that offset fuel costs. Electric cars: 
Remain expensive. The Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid, starts at $39,995. Chevy currently offers a $4,000 rebate and -- for those who qualify -- the federal government kicks in a $7,500 income tax credit subsidy. Even so, that leaves the cheapest Volt at $28,495, or $8,605 more than the lowest-price Chevy Cruze, on which Volt is based, and which has more room for passengers. 
Ford's electric Focus starts at $39,995, or $30,495 after the $7,500 tax credit and a Ford rebate of $2,000. The gasoline Focus with automatic starts at $18,090 and has more trunk room because there's no big battery back there. 
Some automakers are offering tempting lease deals on plug-ins, down to $199 a month. But as with any lease, once it ends, you're left with nothing. You have to hope new low-price lease deals are available, or be willing to make a higher monthly payment to get a replacement car. 
Need expensive accessories. Installing a 240-volt home charger for a plug-in hybrid or electric car -- pretty much a practical necessity -- runs $1,500 to $3,000. Or zero if you use a normal 120-volt outlet, but you must be willing to wait a third of a day to half a day for a full recharge. 
Run on expensive batteries. To replace a battery pack outside of warranty could cost from $4,000 up. Battery warranties are long but not infinite -- 100,000 miles, plus or minus -- and will be a lot less reassuring to a potential second owner. 
To replace a fuel system on a gasoline car would cost much less. To rebuild a gasoline four-cylinder engine, if that seems a fairer comparison, would cost roughly $2,000, though it could range much higher. 
Might require supplemental transportation. If a car's purely electric and has to be plugged in when the batteries are low, the real-world driving range is about 100 miles. That makes it a car for those who mainly drive short distances. Longer trips require a second car. 
If you decide your second car will be an as-needed rental, freeing you from ownership costs, you could spend $50 to $100 a day or more to rent, depending on size, type and location. A plug-in hybrid can be an only car. When the batteries are low, it operates on gasoline power to run the car and help recharge batteries. 
While cheaper than a pure electric, such as Nissan's Leaf, a plug-in hybrid still is more expensive than a conventional or non-plug-in hybrid gasoline car. And a plug-in's battery-only range is less -- 11 to 38 miles, depending on the car, according to the government -- which limits your savings from that $1.14 fuel cost. But the hybrid assist to the gas engine does stretch how far you can go on every $3.63 gallon of gasoline. 
Face uncertain depreciation. Based on actual sales prices, electrified vehicles will depreciate much faster than the most similar gasoline models, forecasts TrueCar.com and its ALG unit. But, if you assume the buyers get the federal tax credit, depreciation's similar. 
For example, a 2013 Ford Focus electric is expected to be worth 51% of its transaction price after three years, while a similar gas model should be worth 65%. But factoring in the government tax credit makes the depreciation about the same. 
May bring higher electricity rates. The DOE says electricity prices are more stable over time than gasoline prices. But if demand grows fast, from electric cars or other uses for electricity, power rates will rise. The current system of power plants and electric grids is struggling to keep up already and improvements will require users to pay more. 
Electricity vs. gasoline cost calculator 
Hoping to promote sales of electric cars and plug-in hybrids, the U.S. Department of Energy has created a website that computes the cost of electricity to go the same distance as a comparable car on 1 gallon of gasoline. 
At Energy.gov/eGallon, the DOE provides a discussion of electricity vs. petroleum as vehicle fuel and a calculator that compares fuel costs for electric vehicles and similar gasoline models by nationwide average or in a single state. 
As of Wednesday, it showed essentially no price difference in Hawaii: $3.74 for a gallon of gas, $3.69 for the equivalent in electricity. But in Illinois, gasoline was $3.84 a gallon, and electricity was 99 cents.

Abstract 
Symptoms such as congestion, shortness of breath, coughing, runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes result when an allergic person inhales an allergen such as pollen, a plant's sperm, and overreacts by releasing histamine. [...]this year's levels are the highest since he began. 

Full Text 
melrose park, ill. From the roof of the Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in the Chicago suburbs, an 83-year-old retired doctor finds troubling evidence of why so many people are sneezing and itching their eyes. 
Joseph Leija counts the pollen and mold spores that collect on slides inside an air-sucking machine atop the six-story building. 
"There's been an increase, no doubt about it," he says of the 5 a.m. weekday counts that he's been doing as a volunteer for 24 years. 
"My allergies are much worse than they used to be," says Amanda Carwyle, a mom of three who lives 95 miles south in Pontiac, Ill. "I used to be able to take a Benadryl or Claritin and be fine." Now, despite three medications and allergy shots that make her feel a bit like a zombie, she says her eyes are watery and her head stuffy. "I'm so miserable." 
Climate change might be partly to blame. Scientists see a link to carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. Tests show that the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more plants generally grow and the more pollen they produce. 
Though some plants grow more food or flowers as a result, more pollen can spell trouble. Doctors say it's contributing to a rise in seasonal hay fever and allergic asthma in the USA, where the pollen season has lengthened up to 16 days since 1995. If carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase, they expect allergic conditions probably will worsen, adding to the discomfort of allergy suffers as well as swelling U.S. health care costs. 
USA TODAY traveled to Chicago, which recently ranked as the sixth worst U.S. city for ragweed sensitivity, as the fourth stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is changing lives. 
"We've definitely seen a big increase in patients," says allergist Brian Rotskoff, whose Clarity Allergy Center has offices a half-hour drive from where Leija counts pollen. He says some kids are coming in at younger ages, and some adults are having worse symptoms or problems for the first time. 
"The severity is affecting their quality of life," he says, noting they're having trouble sleeping and focusing at work or school. Symptoms such as congestion, shortness of breath, coughing, runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes result when an allergic person inhales an allergen such as pollen, a plant's sperm, and overreacts by releasing histamine. 
Sakina Bajowala, an allergist in nearby North Aurora, says she's also seen more patients with respiratory allergies. She has a new adult patient who had been fine with over­the-counter medications but says "he's just miserable now." 
THE CARBON CONNECTION 
"The link between rising carbon dioxide and pollen is pretty clear," says Lewis Ziska, a weed ecologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a top researcher in the field. 
His lab tests show that pollen production rises along with carbon dioxide. It doubled from 5 grams to 10 grams per plant when CO2 in the atmosphere rose from 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1900 to 370 ppm in 2000. He expects it could double again, to 20 grams, by 2075 if carbon emissions continue to climb. The world's CO2 concentration is about 400 ppm. 
"I noticed something changing," says Leonard Bielory, an allergy and immunology expert at Rutgers University's Center for Environmental Prediction. He's been counting pollen in New Jersey for 27 years and initially wondered whether the spike was because of El Nio, a warm ocean current. 
"I saw a trend as I did an analysis," he says, noting his counts in the past five years have been double that of any prior five-year period. In fact, this year's levels are the highest since he began. Bielory expects they could increase 20% to 30% by 2020. 
He says last year's Superstorm Sandy exacerbated the problem by soaking the soil with so much water that even though April was dry, pollen has reached record local levels. 
"There's clear evidence that pollen season is lengthening and total pollen is increasing," says George Luber, associate director for climate change at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's one of the ways climate change is already affecting your community." 
A 2011 study by Ziska and Bielory found that the ragweed season, which peaks in the fall (trees peak in spring and grass in summer), got longer the farther north you go where temperatures have risen more in recent decades. So in Oklahoma City, the season increased only one day from 1995 to 2009, but it jumped 16 days in Minneapolis and Fargo, N.D., and 27 days in Saskatoon, Canada. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, more Americans are testing positive for allergies. Quest Diagnostics, which administers a blood test to detect allergies, found a 15% increase in ragweed sensitivity from 2005 to 2009. It says Chicago's rate was the sixth highest -- after Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas, Kansas City and Riverside, Calif. -- and one of every five Americans is allergic to ragweed in all U.S. regions except the Southeast and Pacific Northwest where fewer people are sensitive. 
CDC allergy skin tests found increased sensitivity not only to ragweed but also to ryegrass, Bermuda grass and mold nationwide between two surveys that spanned an 18-year period, 1976 to 1994. The tests also showed more sensitivity to oak, except in the South. The study's authors say methodology changes might account for some, but not likely all, of the increase, which is consistent with that found in other countries. 
A new CDC report suggests pediatric rates of hay fever, more common than drug or food allergies, remained stable from 1997 to 2011, based on interviews with parents. Co­author Lara Akinbami, a CDC pediatrician, says hay fever may still be increasing but, since its symptoms are similar to those of the common cold, parents may not recognize it as a seasonal allergy. They also might simply be treating it with over-the-counter medicines. 
As for asthma, doctors say it's caused by many factors and exacerbated by pollen for the majority of asthmatics with allergic conditions. Federal data report a 17% increase in 
U.S. asthma prevalence from 2001 through mid-2012. 
Asthma has become a "national epidemic" that affects one of every 12 people, or 56 million, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said this month. Most pediatric cases 
involve allergies, primarily hay fever. 
Luber says many Americans don't suffer directly, but they all pay: "There are substantial costs to the health care system (from allergic conditions) that we all carry." 
Scientists agree that rising pollen counts aren't all bad. In some cases, they boost the production of corn and other crops. 
"It's true that some plants will be able to grow in new places they couldn't before," says Kim Knowlton, a Columbia University professor of public health who focuses on climate 

impacts. She says global warming could mean fewer people die of cold-related deaths. 

"On balance, the negatives outweigh the positives," she says, citing other health problems that could ensue. More illness and deaths are likely from wildfires, flooding, heat-
related strokes and infectious diseases such as cholera, according to the U.S. government's third National Climate Assessment, a draft of which was released in January. 
Aside from pollen, the report says climate change could increase other factors that contribute to respiratory allergies and asthma. It points to higher summertime ozone 

concentrations, which make it more difficult to breathe, as well as more heavy downpours and rising air temperatures, which foster the growth of indoor fungi and molds. 
SUFFERING THE IMPACT 
For Carol Leopold and her 13-year-old twin sons, the pollen count is personal. She says their allergies have worsened in the past couple of years and they hit their peak in May, 

when spring comes alive. 

"Anything that blooms enervates us. It wears us down," says Leopold, 43. She takes an antihistamine every day. When she goes on her 5:30 a.m. runs along Prairie Path in 
Elmhurst, Ill, a Chicago suburb where she lives, she takes her inhaler along. 
Donovan Gill, 3, one of Rotskoff's patients, started showing symptoms two years ago. "We'd go to the playground, and if there was a honey locust tree and little yellow pieces of 

pollen fell from it, he'd blow up like a balloon," says Donovan's mom, Rachel, who lives in Chicago. "His eyes would start to water and get red and swell." 

She says his adenoids -- glands in the back of the nasal cavity that can become swollen -- were removed to help clear his airways. She has had to look extra hard for a 
preschool with clean, well-ventilated classrooms because, like many people with hay fever, Donovan reacts to mold. 
Carwyle, 35, says she limits her exposure to pollen by staying mostly indoors during allergy season. "You try not to sleep with the window open," she says. Her 7-year-old son, 

who had only a few bad days last year, has just started allergy shots because of his sensitivity to -- in her words -- "anything that grows." 

She says spring hit with a bang this year, as reflected in Leija's high counts of both tree and grass pollen. On a morning in mid-May, she recalls, "my whole car was coated with 
pollen." 
CHALLENGES AHEAD 
Researchers looking at how climate change will affect plants, pollen counts and health are the first to say there's a lot they don't know. 
Bielory, for example, is doing EPA-funded research to try to figure out -- based on historical data as well as multiple factors such as wind patterns, precipitation and population 

growth -- how much pollen counts will probably rise. 
In lab chambers, he's growing different weeds and grasses at three different temperatures and CO2 concentrations. 
He's also looking at whether food allergies, in addition to hay fever, are affected by rising carbon dioxide emissions. He suspects they are. 
"There are so many pieces of the puzzle, and it's not a flat puzzle. It's a 3-D puzzle," says Bielory, who says too few scientists study the connections. He devotes two days each 

week to research and spends the other three treating patients. 

The puzzle has non-climate pieces, too. Researchers are looking at why more people are becoming allergic and finding links to chemicals and, perhaps counterintuitively, 
cleanliness. 
The "hygiene hypothesis," backed by some but not all studies, suggests people are more prone to allergies and asthma when they're not exposed to germs early in life. Why? 

Their immune systems haven't learned what's dangerous, such as bacteria, so they overreact to allergens, which are otherwise harmless. 

"All of these things are likely affecting us," says the CDC's Akinbami, but it's unclear which factors -- chemicals, hygiene, pollen -- have the most impact or what their 
relationship is to each other. She says the first two sensitize people and the third triggers their sensitivity. 
On the pollen front alone, there are large gaps in the data, says the CDC's Luber, noting pollen counts are not done on weekends and don't cover every state. There's not a 

single pollen-counting station in Alaska, Hawaii or 16 other U.S. states. 

In fact, the 76 U.S. stations (plus one in Puerto Rico) are run by volunteers trained and certified by the National Allergy Bureau, part of the American Academy of Allergy, 
Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), a private organization that promotes research and treatment. 
"There's no federal funding," says Linda Ford, an allergist who volunteers to do the count for the Omaha area as a way to help her patients. "There is no automated service for 

this," she says, adding it can take as long as two or three hours. 
"This is very important for patients, " says Leija, who does the only count in Illinois. He says if they know pollen season is coming, they can start medications in advance to help 

control their symptoms. 
That's why, even though he retired last year after working 53 years at the hospital as a general practitioner and allergist, he continues to rise before the sun and climb the stairs 
from the sixth floor to the roof -- rain or shine. When it's still dark outside, he wears a miner's head lamp. 

"It's a hobby," Leija says as he removes a pollen and mold slide from the Burkard Spore Trap. The $5,000 device, which the AAAAI provides to counting stations, has a fan that 

draws air in at the same rate that people breathe. 
He starts early, so he can decipher the amount and types of pollen, using a microscope on the third floor, in time for the 7 a.m. TV news. He knows that someday he'll have to 
hand off his sunrise routine. His wife is ailing, so he's been working alongside a nurse who's getting certified to carry on the count. 

Changing Climate Rising carbon dioxide may be driving you right to your doctor's office. Here's one way climate change affects your health: 1) Carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping greenhouse gas that's emitted when burning fossil fuels, such as gasoline from your car. 2) The added CO2 in the atmosphere stimulates plant growth. And bigger plants in turn produce more pollen. This creates a sniffly mess for people who suffer from allergies. 3) In the early 20th century, CO2 concentrations were at 280 parts per million and could reach 720 by 2075. Early 1900s: 280 parts per million Projected 2075: 720 parts per million USA TODAY research Credit: Wendy Koch, @wendykoch, USA TODAY

Abstract 
From the upper Midwest, suffering from recent flooding, to the desert Southwest, where flash floods are more likely even amid sparser rain overall, high-intensity storms are more frequent. The increase largely results from heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, boosting temperatures to spur increases seen worldwide in this century.

On Aug. 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene's rains swelled the Williams River, smashing dams, flooding homes and carrying off the historic Lower Bartonsville Covered Bridge. 
This wasn't just another 1-in-500-years event happening, a freak occurrence, a one-off event. Rather, experts see it as the new normal across the Northeast, the latest in a 

series of calamitous weather events occurring because of, or amplified by, climate change. 

From valleys staggered by Irene, to coasts battered by Superstorm Sandy, the 24-hour outbursts of rain and snow, or "extreme precipitation," has increased by 74% in the past six decades there, according to January's draft of the federal National Climate Assessment report. Such storms have become the signature of climate change across the Northeast, afflicting older cities and towns built at a time of more modest rainfall. This heavy flooding is 
undermining aging bridges, eroding roads and overwhelming drainage systems. 
USA TODAY traveled to the birch- and maple-dappled hills of Vermont as the third stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is already changing lives. 
"I grew up here. I live here now," Hammond says, standing on the gravel road leading to the covered bridge's crossing. "The bridge has always been here." 
That bridge, and hundreds more like it, were damaged in the storm, along with dams, roads, houses and most everything in sight. Three people died and more than $700 

million in damage was sustained in Vermont alone. Before trailing off in Canada, Irene had killed 49 people and caused more than $10 billion in damages in 2011, according to 

the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
That was only a warm-up for last year's Superstorm Sandy, which delivered even more crippling blows, killing more than 130 people nationwide and causing more than $75 
billion in damages. 

Hammer blows such as these storms are consistent with climate change's expected effects on the Northeast, says climatologist Cameron Wake of the University of New 

Hampshire in Durham. 
"It's not just those two storms," he says. "We are suddenly seeing many extreme precipitation events, ones that have led to several 100-year floods across the region just in the 
last 15 years." 

The soggy misfortune of these extreme events has reached well beyond the Northeast. From the upper Midwest, suffering from recent flooding, to the desert Southwest, where flash floods are more likely even amid sparser rain overall, high-intensity storms are more frequent. But nowhere is the increase as pronounced as in the Northeast, where already-moist air means more extreme "extreme precipitation." 
The more intense rainfall is a direct impact of warmer air temperatures tied to climate change juicing the weather cycle, according to the federal assessment report. Average temperatures in the region -- the home of some 64 million people stretching from Washington, D.C., to Portland, Maine -- have increased 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century, with most of the increase coming in the past three decades. 
The increase largely results from heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, boosting temperatures to spur increases seen worldwide in this century. 
STORMS CHANGE 'EVERYTHING' 
Amid trees just starting to bud with spring, Vermont's State Road 121 follows the twisting course of the Saxtons River. Along the way, Timothy Cullenen, who was municipal 
manager of nearby Rockingham, Vt., during Irene, points out wrecked homes and condemned, covered bridges with sidewalls beaten out and replaced. 

"We had roads washed out, people trapped in homes," Cullenen says, recounting how firefighters had to boat people out of homes inundated by a river suddenly stuffed with battering-ram-size trees and hissing propane tanks with broken valves. The frequency of these storms "changes everything for us, from what size culverts we build, to where people can live," Cullenen says. 
The Northeast averages about 55 inches of rain and snow annually, according to NOAA records. That's 10% more than just over a century ago. 
What's causing the additional rain? It's simple. Warmer air causes more evaporation from streams, lakes and seas. Warmer air also holds more moisture. So, when it falls, it 
really unloads -- thus, more extreme storms. 
"Increased extreme precipitation in the Northeast is one of the clearest signals of climate change that we can see nationwide," says climate expert Donald Wuebbles of the 

University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. "It's not just more rain, but more rain falling in buckets over long periods of time." 

In the hills of the Northeast, heavy rains are funneled into valley streams and rivers, carrying timber and sand downstream. "Bridges become dams when the water rises and 
this stuff slams into them," says FEMA historic preservation expert Peter Thomas. 
In Irene, ground already saturated with rainwater couldn't handle the downpour, making flooding more likely. (Rainfall totaled more than 25 inches for much of the Northeast in 

August and September 2011, compared with about 8 inches normally.) 

"Streams and rivers scoured out by floods just become race tracks for the next flood," Thomas says. "They won't have as much time to naturally restore themselves if climate 
change is making floods more common." 
'OH MY GOD': BRIDGE CRUMBLES 
"I never had been able to see the river from my window in August before," Hammond says of the day the bridge washed out. All morning, she and her neighbors had walked 

down to the bridge to see the river rise. Recording a video of the flooding, she captured the terrible creaking of the century-old structure and sight of it unrolling off its 

abutments into the water below. The wood tumbled in the river for a half-mile. 
Hammond's video and heartfelt, "Oh, my God," response to the bridge's disappearance went viral on YouTube, seen by more than a half-million people and shown widely on 
television. "I had no idea it had gone viral until my sister told me days later, after we got power back," Hammond says. 

The bridge had been in place since 1870. Now its wreckage sits, three rows of timber in Rockingham's winter gravel dump, joined by stumps, trees and junk pulled from the 
river by the town at a cost of $450,000. 
"We used to have an emergency fund. And then we had an emergency. Now it is gone," Cullenen says. "But we still might have another emergency." 

CITIES STRUGGLE TO ADAPT 
Towns and cities across the Northeast are built for the wrong century -- the last one -- says civil engineer Paul Kirshen of Climate Solutions New England, a colleague of Wake, 
the climatologist. "We've seen the 'once in a century' storm's water level increase," he says. Where a storm with a 1% chance of happening every year used to dump 6 inches of 
water (162,924 gallons per acre), that same storm now delivers 8 inches (217,232 gallons per acre), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 

That means street drains aren't big enough and wastewater facilities can't handle floods. Culverts, the large pipes that carry water under roads, are increasingly being washed out across the region, according to a 2009 Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology study. Expensive sewer systems built for last century's specifications are too small to handle the extra water. More cars and more people mean more pavement, which dumps water on towns built in the horse-and-buggy era, instead of letting it soak in. 
For cities such as Philadelphia and Exeter, N.H., one solution has been to try "low-impact" development: planting more greenery in a bid to soak up rainwater before it hits the drains. Another change has been "flexible" development, in which reservoirs and seawalls are designed so that additions can be made, if needed. "That's a total change in engineering," Kirshen says. "In the past, we built to specifications for now, and walked away." 
A longer-term solution, Wake points out, is "putting less greenhouse gas in the air." 
Depending on future emissions, average yearly temperatures will increase anywhere from 3 to 10 degrees by the 2080s, according to the draft federal National Climate 
Assessment report. 
NEW ENGLAND'S ESSENCE 
Standing on the gravel road leading to her Vermont hamlet, Hammond looks at the rebuilt Lower Bartonsville Covered Bridge, its spruce sides gleaming blond in the sunlight, 

the sawmill scent of fresh-cut wood hanging in the air. The new bridge, built to historical standards, now exceeds its original length by 17 feet to stretch 168 feet across the 

Williams River. It rests on concrete abutments with pilings driven 40 feet into the ground -- not the stone causeways that were undermined in the 2011 flood. 
"A covered bridge is part of what New England is, and it connected us to the world," Hammond says. "Maybe you have to live here to understand it. It really was quite a blow to 
see it pulled away." 

The new bridge is designed to last 75 years, taking it almost to the end of the century, when it will face a very different New England. 
"Unless something happens again," Hammond says, before walking back to her home.

Abstract 
Increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases caused by the burning of the oil, gas and coal that power our world are enhancing the natural "greenhouse effect," causing the temperature of the atmosphere and oceans to warm to levels that climate scientists say cannot be linked to natural forces. 

Full Text 
The temperature of Earth's atmosphere has been essentially the same for the past decade or so, providing ammunition for skeptics of human-caused climate change. (This despite the fact that of the nine hottest years on record, eight have occurred since 2000, according to the National Climatic Data Center). 
However, a recent study found that heat absorbed by Earth's oceans has increased significantly over the same period, prompting the study co-authors to say that the warming has been diverted and is heating the oceans instead of the atmosphere. 
The study was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the American Geophysical Union. 
The current "hiatus" in atmospheric warming is temporary, says study co-author Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., during a telephone news conference Thursday: "Global warming is continuing but manifesting itself differently." 
Here's how scientists say global warming works: Increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases caused by the burning of the oil, gas and coal that power our world are enhancing the natural "greenhouse effect," causing the temperature of the atmosphere and oceans to warm to levels that climate scientists say cannot be linked to natural forces. 
"Over 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases winds up warming the oceans," said Josh Willis, a scientist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Oceans cover two-thirds of the Earth's surface, so it's expected that they'll play a large role in how climate change and global warming play out." 
A large chunk of the warmth appears to be settling far down in the ocean about a half-mile beneath the surface, Trenbreth says. New technology over the past decade or so have allowed scientists to better measure the temperature of the deep oceans, Willis says. 
While Earth's excess heat comes from climate change, the amount that's absorbed into the oceans (as opposed to staying in the atmosphere) appears to be due to natural changes in climatic wind and ocean patterns, according to the study. 
Temporary pauses and restarts in atmospheric temperature shouldn't detract from the main story: "The planet is warming, climate change is happening and the primary cause is greenhouse gases released by human activities," Willis says.

How climate change threatens the seas -- and yes, seafood: Oysters a 'canary in the coal mine' as acidification of oceans imperils our food chain

Abstract 
[...]researchers are seeing similar corrosive effects on Florida's coral reefs that shelter young fish and on the tiny sea snails that feed salmon and other species in the Pacific Ocean. Because of ocean chemistry, water three times more acidic resides at greater ocean depths. 

Full Text 
The tide rolls out on a chilly March evening, and the oystermen roll in, steel rakes in hand, hip boots crunching on the gravel beneath a starry, velvet sky. 
As they prepare to harvest some of the sweetest shellfish on the planet, a danger lurks beyond the shore that will eventually threaten clams, mussels, everything with a shell or that eats something with a shell. The entire food chain could be affected. That means fish, fishermen and, perhaps, you. "Ocean acidification," the shifting of the ocean's water toward the acidic side of its chemical balance, has been driven by climate change and has brought increasingly corrosive 
seawater to the surface along the West Coast and the inlets of Puget Sound, a center of the $111 million shellfish industry in the Pacific Northwest. 
USA TODAY traveled to the tendrils of Oyster Bay as the second stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is already affecting lives. 
The acidification taking place here guarantees the same for the rest of the world's oceans in the years ahead. This isn't the kind of acid that burns holes in chemist's shirt 

sleeves; ocean water is actually slightly alkaline. But since the start of the industrial revolution, the world's oceans have grown nearly 30% more acidic, according to a 2009 Scientific Committee on Oceanic Resources report. Why? Climate change, where heat-trapping carbon dioxide emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels ends up as excess carbonic acid absorbed into the ocean. 
That shift hurts creatures like oysters that build shells or fish that eat those creatures or folks like shellfish farmer Bill Dewey, who makes his living off the ocean. 
"As fresh as they get, you could eat one now," says Dewey of Taylor Shellfish Farms in Shelton, Wash., shucking an oyster open, mud running from its shell to reveal the opulent 
meat within, silver and white in the starlight. The black lip curling around the sweet-tasting shellfish reveals it to be a Pacific oyster, farmed worldwide. 
"Folks think we just get rich picking oysters off the ground. A lot of work goes into every one of these, and we can't afford to lose any of them," Dewey says. 
Lose them they have, and lose them they will, to the water lapping at Dewey's hip boots where the low tide meets the flats. 
"We are looking into the future happening now," Dewey says. And researchers are seeing similar corrosive effects on Florida's coral reefs that shelter young fish and on the tiny 

sea snails that feed salmon and other species in the Pacific Ocean. 
TOO MUCH OF 'A GOOD THING' 
Because of ocean chemistry, water three times more acidic resides at greater ocean depths. When conditions are right, strong winds blowing over ocean water along steep 

coasts, such as along the West Coast of North America, generate "upwelling" of these deep waters. The results bring this more corrosive seawater to the shallows of places such 

as Puget Sound, a foreshadowing today of how the oceans will look in a few decades. 
"We are able to see the effects of ocean acidification," says oceanographer Richard Feely of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He first charted upwelling of 
deeper, corrosive ocean water on the surface of the Pacific Ocean along the West Coast on a 2007 expedition. 

How did it get there in the first place? Atmospheric carbon ends up absorbed directly by the ocean, where plankton sucks up carbon dioxide via photosynthesis. "That's a good 
thing," Feely says, because the carbon dioxide they ingest means less warming of the atmosphere. 
But when those sea plants and creatures die, they fall to the depths. Some of the consumed carbon ends up dissolved in deep ocean waters. 
"Once we had the canary in the coal mine; now we have the oyster in the ocean," says Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. 

AN OYSTER MYSTERY 
In the same year that Feely and his colleagues made their upwelling discovery, disaster struck the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery in Netarts Bay, perched on the edge of 
Oregon's Pacific coast. Baby oysters grown there to be shipped to shellfish farms worldwide were dying en masse, tens of millions of millimeter-size larvae filling hatching tanks, 
all dead. 

"We were very close to going out of business. It was a major deal," says Sue Cudd of the Whiskey Creek hatchery. Bankruptcy threatened because of unfilled orders, and the entire industry faced collapse without the larvae, the seeds that shellfish growers needed to raise Pacific oysters over the next 18 months. A second hatchery run by Dewey's employers, Taylor Shellfish -- one of four in the region -- saw the same die-off the next year, with the same failure to spawn striking wild oysters in Washington's Willapa Bay, a longtime source of seeds for the industry. 
It was only at the end of 2008 at a shellfish farmer's meeting that Feely delivered the bad news: On days in the summer along the West Coast when northerly winds blew, deep ocean water was likely dissolving the fragile young oysters. 
Without industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the upwelling wouldn't be a problem because really corrosive water wouldn't get high enough to reach the surface, says Burke Hales of Oregon State University in Corvallis. "That extra kick from (man-made) carbon is what pushes the saturation point high enough," Hales says. "Anyone who says this is a natural thing just doesn't get it or is missing that key point." 
Shellfish rely on calcium to build their shells, and a more corrosive water makes that harder for them to the point of becoming impossible. 
Alan Barton, the staff scientist at Whiskey Creek, realized the seawater was far too acidic and started making phone calls to Hales to have the water examined. Last year, Barton, Hales and colleagues, including Feely, definitively showed that those deep waters do dissolve baby oysters only a few days old, ones which rely on a very soft form of calcium for their initial growth spurt. 
"A lot of people out here I talk to don't believe in climate change, but ocean acidification -- to them that's real -- because they can see it eating into their livelihoods," Hales says. "The chemistry is really simple and really inevitable: More carbon in the air means more carbon in the ocean, and there is no getting around it." 
AN OCEAN-SIZE CHALLENGE 
Benoit Eudeline, staff scientist for Taylor Shellfish, and colleagues such as Barton at Whiskey Creek have become evangelists on the topic for the seafood industry, warning their colleagues on the East Coast of what is coming. There, deep-water upwelling is not a problem, but warmer waters have shifted crab and fish populations while acidic mud on the Maine seafloor has hurt clamming. 
"We were joking about what size antacid tablet you would need to fix the ocean," Eudeline said. "It is so tremendous that you can only make jokes about it." 
That's because the ocean absorbs 23% of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions, according to a 2012 Earth System Science Data journal report, more than 8 billion tons of the stuff every year. It would take a very large Alka-Seltzer tablet to fix that. "That's why talk about just avoiding warming from here on out in the atmosphere is missing the effects that are already locked in due to ocean acidification," Feely says. 
Back on the tidal inlet at Oyster Bay, Dewey walks along rotting wooden dike walls placed there more than a century ago, by earlier shellfish farmers, down to where the low tide has fallen. All kinds of shellfish and other sea life, including the famed salmon of the Pacific Northwest, live in these same waters, enjoying the bounty of these waves. 
"We only know what is happening to shellfish because they have spokesmen," Dewey says. "Only the good Lord knows what is happening to everything else out there."

Renewable energy losing its shine in Europe: Debt crisis makes it harder to justify - or afford - subsidies

Abstract 
[...]subsidies are widespread in Europe, where policymakers say that energy from wind and the sun will stave off global temperature increases they blame on the use of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. "Because of the additional supply of electricity offered from renewables, the price for electricity has fallen -- that's good for corporate or industry clients, but not so for private homes," said Claudia Kemfert, an energy analyst at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. 

Full Text 
For British entrepreneur Timothy Porter and millions of other Europeans who get generous financial incentives for solar panels, the sun has been very lucrative. 
Not only does the government pay Porter for the solar energy he produces, at far higher than the market rate for electricity, but he can also use what he generates for himself. 
"It's fantastic," he said, admiring the solar panel he installed on the roof of his home in the English West Midlands two years ago. 
Such subsidies are widespread in Europe, where policymakers say that energy from wind and the sun will stave off global temperature increases they blame on the use of fossil 

fuels such as oil and coal. But Europe's debt crisis has many countries worrying more about their bottom lines than climate. 

Across the English Channel, German consumers are waking up to the costs of going green: As of Jan. 1, they are paying 11% more for electricity than they did last year thanks 
to government plans to replace nuclear plants with wind and solar power that require significant and constant public money to be made cost-effective. 
There were a few reasons the subsidies were put in place years ago. 
There was a general desire for energy independence from Russia, where natural gas had been used as a weapon to pressure nations on political matters and the cost was 

unpredictable. Renewable energy was also seen as a source for jobs and income. 

There was also concern for the climate, say analysts: A 2011 Eurobarometer poll showed that Europeans believe climate change to be a graver problem than the financial crisis plaguing Europe. Nowhere is this concern more acute than in Germany. The country has long had an ambitious clean energy plan that aims to have the entire country running on 80% renewable 
energies by the year 2050. 
That plan was fast-tracked following the accident at Japan's Fukushima reactor in March 2011, and by Germans' overwhelming opposition to nuclear power stemming from the 

lingering memories of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union more than two decades ago. For years after, forest-loving Germans worried about picking 
wild mushrooms. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel -- once a champion of nukes -- did an about-face. She announced that all of Germany's 17 nuclear plants would be shut down by the year 2022, 14 

years ahead of schedule, and closed eight immediately. 

Her decision might have little to do with the safety of Germany's nuclear reactors. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party faces federal elections in September: 
If she wants to remain chancellor she needs to siphon votes from rival parties the Greens and Social Democrats, both anti-nuke. 
Dubbed the energy transition, the move has become a logistical and financial headache for Berlin. Nuclear power had represented one-fifth of the country's energy supply, and 

Environment Minister Peter Altmaier recently estimated cost for the shift to renewables could total up to $1.3 trillion by 2030. 
The move left some of Germany's neighbors grumbling. 
"Outside of Germany, we've noticed that there are two perspectives," said Gerd Rosenkranz, a spokesman for the non-profit German Environmental Aid. "One is, 'there go those 

crazy Germans again' and the other is 'there go those crazy Germans again - but it's possible that they'll succeed.' " 
But at what price? 
In Germany, the rapid switch to renewables has sent electricity prices soaring. In January, the extra charges paid by German consumers to suppliers of renewable energy alone 

rose 47%. That, analysts say, means annual electricity bills will rise by nearly $258 for households across Germany. 

"Because of the additional supply of electricity offered from renewables, the price for electricity has fallen -- that's good for corporate or industry clients, but not so for private homes," said Claudia Kemfert, an energy analyst at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. "That's a crooked picture that nobody really expected beforehand." Analysts say that Germans are willing to pay for renewable energy out of concern for the environment and climate change. 
"It's taken so seriously because we see that climate change is already happening, that (carbon dioxide) emissions are already causing some droughts, floods and melting of the ice sheets," said Brigitte Knopf, head of the Sustainable Solutions group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 
Skeptics of Germany's energy transition at home and abroad say that it is a waste of money, that data indicate that global warming may not be what had been predicted. 
The cost of trying to change the climate has become too much to bear for other European nations mired in debt or hobbled by overspending. 
As austerity measures take hold from Spain to the Netherlands, governments have been rushing to cut the subsidies for green energy they once eagerly waved through to help the infant sectors grow. 
Those subsidies -- pioneered by Germany in 2000 to help meet Europewide climate goals enshrined in European Union law -- spurred an unsustainable, artificial boom in solar, wind and other renewables, which may have contributed to financial meltdown on the continent. 
Similar policies have spread to 50 countries worldwide, including 16 of the 27 EU member states. As a result, the renewables sector boomed, in particular solar, even in countries such as Germany where a sunny day is far more rare than in Spain. 
"It's government subsidized electricity prices that have given rise to the current problems in Europe, not renewable energy," said Sebastian Mariz, managing partner at EPPA consultancy firm in Madrid. "(Subsidies) are just one of the external costs which increase this electricity deficit." 
That has left Europeans struggling to figure out what to do next. In Spain, a country on the brink of economic collapse, the situation is dire: Madrid owes $35 billion to Spanish utility companies -- debt accumulated over a decade of government-regulated electricity prices. 
European governments have now realized this growth -- which saw consumers footing the bill for investors' soaring profit margins -- was out of control: The U.K. and Czech Republic have already cut their subsidies in half, while Italy imposed a cap on new renewable energy providers. Germany cut subsidies by up to 30%. 
"Germany needed to act," said Matthias Lang, an attorney at Bird & Bird in Dusseldorf, a firm that specializes in energy. "The previous rate was simply not sustainable. There is a limit where even the most willing consumers will object." 
Analysts say that whether it is renewables or fossil fuels, EU energy infrastructure overall is aging -- about half of the continent's existing power generating capacity from coal, nuclear and gas will have to be replaced in the next 10 years, despite austerity, and that is expensive -- for fossil fuel production or renewables. 
"Investment will have to happen, there is little choice," said Frauke Thies, EU energy policy adviser at Greenpeace. "The question is where these investments happen and which technologies Europe invests in." 
Analysts say the cost burden of moving to renewables is one Europeans will only shoulder in the immediate future. As the technology and infrastructure improve at a rapid pace, the expense will shrink dramatically. 
"There are higher electricity prices and they will be higher for a certain time period because of the transition, but at some point this system will be the cheaper one because the nuclear reactors and conventional power plants are getting increasingly expensive," said Rosenkranz of German Environmental Aid. 
"The problem is, with the financial crisis there is not much cash at the moment, and to get there you need to invest the cash now," said Stephane Bourgeois, head of Regulatory Affairs at the European Wind Energy Association.

Abstract 
If confirmed by the Senate, they would take over agencies with missions that Obama raised to the top of his priority list in his recent inaugural address and State of the Union speech, calling for a doubling in energy efficiency and other steps to address global warming. 

Full Text 
Reflecting his intent to tackle climate change in his second term, President Obama picked two Washington veterans who've been wrestling with such issues for years. 
Obama announced the selection of the Environmental Protection Agency's clean air chief Gina McCarthy, 58, to head the agency and MIT professor Ernest Moniz, 68, to lead the Department of Energy on Monday. In making the long-expected picks, Obama said, "they're going to be making sure that we're investing in American energy, that we're doing everything that we can to combat the threat of climate change." 
If confirmed by the Senate, they would take over agencies with missions that Obama raised to the top of his priority list in his recent inaugural address and State of the Union speech, calling for a doubling in energy efficiency and other steps to address global warming. 
Both McCarthy, who headed the EPA's air-pollution efforts during Obama's first term, and Moniz, who was a top Energy official during President Clinton's second term, stand out as politically experienced pragmatists, policy analysts say. 
"Both of these nominees are very consistent in pursuing practical means, not ideology, to reach their goals," said policy expert Dan Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental group. 
McCarthy, who also worked for two former GOP governors including Mitt Romney when he led Massachusetts, is known for considering industry concerns during her successful push to nearly double gas-mileage standards for new cars and light trucks by 2025. 
Moniz supports nuclear power, natural gas as a "bridge fuel" to replace coal and burying carbon dioxide from power plants underground, none of which are favorites with environmental groups. His broad energy research embodies Obama's "all of the above" energy strategy. 
Chief among challenges awaiting McCarthy, who will replace her current boss Lisa Jackson, are calls by the NRDC and other groups for tighter emission caps on existing coal-fired power plants, the leading U.S. source of greenhouse gases. 
Such regulations give the industry pause. Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, said Obama touts job creation as a top priority, but adds, "The problem is that EPA, in many cases, is not proposing regulations that meet this goal." 
Other looming issues include an Obama decision on whether to approve the northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline. The billion-dollar private project would carry a heavy crude oil, known as tar sands oil, from Canada across the Great Plains to refineries in Illinois and Texas. On Friday, the State Department issued a draft review that riled environmentalists, who seek the pipeline's rejection, by saying Canada's tar sands will likely be developed whether the project is approved or not. 
Environmental groups expect McCarthy will be on their side. The president "has scored a slam dunk for the environment by picking Gina McCarthy," said Gene Karpinski of the League of Conservation Voters.

Why you should sweat climate change: More asthma, heat strokes and flooding (and that's just the warm-up act)

Abstract 
[...]a remaking of America is likely in our lifetimes -- a flicker in geological time. Melting Arctic sea ice is opening the Northwest Passage off Alaska's coast to tourism, maritime shipping and oil exploration. 

Full Text 
More American children are getting asthma and allergies, and more seniors are suffering heat strokes. 
Food and utility prices are rising. Flooding is overrunning bridges, swamping subways and closing airport runways. 
People are losing jobs in drought-related factory closings. Cataclysmic storms are wiping out sprawling neighborhoods. Towns are sinking. 
This isn't a science-fiction, end-of-the-world scenario. Though more anecdotal than normal -- today, at least -- these scenes are already playing out somewhere in the United States, and they're expected to get worse in the years ahead. In fact, a remaking of America is likely in our lifetimes -- a flicker in geological time. This will transform how and where we live, work and play. 
Massachusetts' climate will start to look more like North Carolina's, and Illinois will begin to feel like Texas. Montana's Glacier National Park, a glorious site that draws tourists from around the world, will likely lose its glaciers. 
Climate change is partly the culprit. Scientific research shows that it's increasing the risk and intensity of heat waves, downpours, drought and wildfires. A key factor: the burning of fossil fuels. With these changes come rising sea levels and acidified oceans. So when Superstorm Sandy struck New York harbor in October, the flooding that killed scores of people, ruined thousands of homes and closed subways as well as airports came amid already rising seas. 
As the planet edges this year toward what some scientists say will be the highest concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions in at least 800,000 years, USA TODAY reporters will travel the country to explore places where climate change is already affecting lives. 
Not all of it is bad news. As with any change, there will be winners and losers, especially at the local level. There will be longer growing seasons, lower heating bills and fewer cold-related deaths. Melting Arctic sea ice is opening the Northwest Passage off Alaska's coast to tourism, maritime shipping and oil exploration. 
Yet on a national level, the losers will probably outnumber the winners, according to a draft report of the third National Climate Assessment released by the U.S. government in January. 
Americans can adapt to some climate change, and indeed already are, but a continuing rise in global carbon emissions will make adapting increasingly costly and difficult -­especially in developed coastal areas. 
Some potential impacts, such as higher flood-insurance premiums for luxury waterfront homes or more bald spots on ski slopes, might seem trivial. Others -- lower home values on the coasts, heat-related deaths in the Midwest or the relocation of entire villages in Alaska -- not so much. 
The effects of this new world are reverberating from coast to coast: 
"Who's going to hire me now?" asks Barbara Roberts, 56, who lost her job of 36 years a month ago on Feb. 1 when a Cargill beef-processing plant in Plainview, Texas, closed. The facility, which employed 2,000 people, was starved of cattle because of the drought. Roberts, who earned $13.70 an hour plus benefits, says she hurt her back after 20 years on the production line, leaving her unable to lift heavy items. The only other large, decent-paying employer in town, she says, is Walmart. 
"My house isn't straight anymore. It's tilted," says Jeff Miskill, a contractor in Norfolk, Va., where rising sea levels have contributed to repeated flooding throughout the city and a shifting of the ground under his home. 
"You can feel it inside. You feel like you're walking uphill." Miskill says neighbors aren't worried about the semantics of what's happening, whether climate change or flooding. "Call it what you will," he says, "but we have a water problem." 
"My windows and doors are rotted away," says Stanley Tom, 52, the tribal administrator of Newtok, Alaska, a place where severe flooding is always a risk. The area's infrastructure was built on permafrost -- soil saturated with frozen water -- that because of higher temperatures is now melting into mud. Roads and runways have been ruined, and water supplies are contaminated. 
All of Newtok's 350 or so residents are being relocated from the eroding coastline to higher ground because, as Tom says, "the village is sinking." 
Inside 'the mixed bag' 
Scores of politicians and millions of Americans are skeptics. After all, no single storm, heat wave or wildfire -- unlike longer-term patterns -- can be linked directly to climate change. These esteemed scientists don't have all the answers, particularly as their projections stretch far into the future. Although almost all agree on the broad contours of human-induced climate change, they continue to refine the details as new data and better tracking technology -- such as a series of NASA satellites launched in 2000 -- become available. 
"It's a mixed bag," says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about the link between extreme weather and climate change. Though Emanuel once doubted the evidence, he now says the world is clearly warming beyond its natural variability. 
Emanuel, author of What We Know About Climate Change, says rainfall may have the clearest climate link. He says it now occurs less often, but when it does rain, downpours are more likely. So wet regions will be wetter, causing flash flooding. Dry ones will get drier, resulting in drought. Heat, of course, is another consequence. So a heat wave that used to occur once every 100 years now happens every five years. 
An indicator of that warming is the rising concentration of carbon-dioxide emissions in the atmosphere -- now at 396 parts per million, according to January data by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was about 275 parts per million two centuries ago, and research by British Antarctic Survey's Eric Wolff suggests that it probably hasn't exceeded 400 ppm -- likely within the next few years worldwide -- in at least 800,000 years. Leading climate scientists, including NASA's James Hansen, warn that concentrations above 350 ppm risk planetary perils, including melting ice sheets and rapidly spreading drought. 
The most recent decade was the nation's hottest on record, and 2012 was the hottest single year. The average U.S. temperature has risen 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable record-keeping began in 1895 -- 80% of that has occurred since 1980. The increase might seem small, but scientists warn that a ripple effect can trigger "tipping points," beyond which the planet may not be able to recover. 
For example, the warmer the air, the more summer Arctic sea ice is lost. The more sea ice that's lost, the more warming occurs because ice reflects sunlight while water absorbs it. As the atmosphere warms, it holds larger amounts of water vapor, which could help energize everything from hurricanes to snowstorms. And the cycle continues. 
Average U.S. temperatures will likely rise at least another 2 degrees to 4 degrees in most places in the next few decades and between 3 to 10 degrees by 2100, depending on the amount of oil, gas and coal we burn, according to the draft of the 2013 National Climate Assessment. The report, written by 240 private and government scientists, is based on hundreds of studies published in science journals. 
Higher temperatures mean higher sea levels, too. The reason's simple: As water warms, it expands. While global sea level has risen 8 inches since 1900 and is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the problem is worse along the U.S. Atlantic Coast because of differences in ocean currents, salinity, water temperatures and land movements. 
The economic costs of all these changes are enormous -- not only for those directly affected but also for the nation's taxpayers, who are stuck with the bills for disaster relief, national flood insurance and drought-related crop losses. In February, for the first time, the non-partisan General Accountability Office said climate change puts the U.S. government at "high risk "of financial exposure. NOAA says 11 extreme weather and climate events last year alone in the United States cost more than $1 billion each. 
At the heart of it: Water 
For Jimmy Strickland, climate issues aren't theoretical. They're business. He owns an accounting firm with a one-story brick office building two blocks from Norfolk's waterfront. During his 35 years in the Hague section of town, three huge storms have struck -- all in the past decade. Each time, his building flooded and had to be closed at least two months for repairs that cost his insurance company about $250,000. 
"You lose time, and time is money," Strickland says. 
While Norfolk is second only to New Orleans for sea-level rise, partly because its land is naturally sinking, other coastal U.S. cities -- Boston; Charleston, S.C.; Miami; New York; Seattle; San Francisco; Tampa -- are vulnerable, too. 
"It's a harbinger of things to come," says Leonard Berry, a geoscience professor at Florida Atlantic University, of the regular high-tide flooding on Miami's streets. The Army Corps of Engineers expects that South Florida's sea level will rise 3 to 7 inches by 2030; the range jumps from 9 to 24 inches by 2060. 
While there's too much water in some places, there's not enough in others. Drought afflicted as much as 65% of the contiguous lower 48 states last year and still lingers in more than half of the country. Corn, wheat and soybean crops were decimated, prompting higher food prices. Nearly two dozen ethanol plants in 13 states halted production because they lacked a key ingredient: corn. 
In Plainview, Texas, Cargill's plant closing took workers by surprise. 
"They didn't tell us 'til that day," Roberts says. "It was 10:45 a.m. when the announcement came: 'Everyone off the floor.'" She says they went to the cafeteria for the news. "We didn't go back to the floor. We went home." 
"The U.S. cattle herd is at its lowest level since 1952," Cargill Beef's president, John Keating, said in announcing the closure. He said the company held off "as long as possible," hoping the drought would break. "Unfortunately," he added, "the drought has not broken." 
But heat alone is a hazard 
Others have suffered from, if not drought, the heat itself. 
"It's the silent killer," says Laurence Kalkstein, a University of Miami professor who studies the effect of heat on health. He says if climate change brings hotter -- but still variable -- weather, more heat-related deaths will likely occur. 
Riley Kimble was found dead in a tiny, stifling apartment without air conditioning in Chicago last July on a day when outside temperatures reached 103. The city's medical examiner said heat stress contributed to his death and that of at least two dozen others. He was 59. 
His stepdaughter, Nicole Hughes, says he suffered from schizophrenia. As a young man, before his illness struck, she says, Kimble was a college student and avid reader who helped her with homework. He was the only dad she ever knew. 
Ernestine Williams says she's struggling to "keep it together" since her daughter Mary, then 56, died in the same Chicago heat wave. She lives on a widow's pension but has taken in Mary's three young adult children, who she says took the death "real hard. No one was prepared for that."

Full Text 
Minnesota's decision last month to end its moose-hunting season because of the animal's rapidly declining numbers in the state has made the gangly, iconic symbol of cold 
northlands a new player in the debate over climate change. 
Some scientists attribute the threats to climate change; others say more study is needed. Doug Inkley, a senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, says moose are "the 
canary in the coal mine. As a large-bodied animal that needs cool temperatures, it is particularly susceptible to climate change." 

While the polar bear's problems are well-publicized, he says, "moose are in our backyards. This is a very unfortunate and prominent declaration that climate change is in our 

backyards." 
The most stressed moose population now appears to be in Minnesota, where it has fallen from 8,840 to 2,760 in seven years, a drop of 69%, including a drop of 35% in the 
past year alone. In response, the state closed the fall hunting season and embarked on a high-tech study of what is killing the moose. 

"It is survival of the fittest, and moose are ending up on the wrong end of the stick," says Gary Botzek, executive director of the Minnesota Conservation Federation. 

He suspects that milder winters in recent years are raising the survival rates of bloodsucking ticks that attack moose by the tens of thousands and that warmer-than-normal 
summers have further stressed the animals. 
The drop in the moose population was a "much steeper decline than we had seen in the past," says Lou Cornicelli, who is leading Minnesota's study. He says he's not sure what 

is causing the decline. The state put GPS collars on 100 moose last month to check whether ticks are the primary cause. Other factors could be a brain worm carried by deer or 

kills by a growing wolf population, he says. 
The stress on moose depends on the latitude where they live. Moose populations are doing well in Alaska and Maine, where colder climates and vast, changing landscapes are 
moose heaven. Maine, in fact, is considering raising the number of moose-hunting licenses from 3,725 last year to 4,000 in 2013. Its population is estimated at 76,000. 

Lee Kantar, Maine moose biologist, says the population has stayed healthy because it is farther north than other stressed populations and because Maine's logging industry 
creates an ideal environment for moose that depend on young trees and ever-evolving forests for food and shelter. 
David James, an Alaska state moose specialist in the Fairbanks region, says the state's moose population -- estimated in the tens of thousands -- remains healthy. 

In states on the southern end of moose range, warmer winters, dwindling habitat, disease and predators are all being studied as possible reasons for falling moose populations. 
"The answers are a lot more complicated than people want them to be," says Russ Mason of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Mason says a commission is likely 
to recommend against holding the state's first modern moose hunting season this year because the population -- an estimated 451 moose in the Upper Peninsula -- is barely 
stable. 

Montana is counting its moose population and studying what is killing them. "We still have a relatively healthy population but not as healthy as it was," says Ron Aasheim of the 

State Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
New Hampshire, where ticks are a problem, has cut its hunting licenses from 408 last year to 281 for 2013. The moose population has dwindled from an estimated 7,000 in 
1996 to about 4,500 today. 

Kristine Rines of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, says the state has had shorter winters, which the ticks exploit. 

Rines says biologists have found as many as 120,000 ticks on a single moose. The insects not only cause anemia but force moose to rub, reducing their coats and making them 
susceptible to hypothermia. 
Botzek says Minnesotans worry about losing an animal that has long symbolized the state's outdoors. 
"Moose are pretty important animals to our psyche here in Minnesota," he says. "We lose moose, I don't think we are getting them back."

Obama supported on guns, debt: Divided and dissatisfied with both sides, public is less aligned with Republicans

Abstract 
Since winning re-election, Obama has outlined bolder policies and taken a less compromising stance toward the GOP lawmakers he blames for frustrating much of his legislative agenda over the past two years. In his inaugural address and State of the Union speech, and at events across the country, he has focused more on generating public support for his proposals than on forging ties with Congress to negotiate them. 

Full Text 
President Obama starts his second term with a clear upper hand over GOP leaders on issues from guns to immigration that are likely to dominate the year, a USA TODAY/Pew Research Center Poll finds. On the legislation rated most urgent -- cutting the budget deficit -- even a majority of Republican voters endorse Obama's approach of seeking tax hikes as well as spending cuts. 
The survey underscores the quandary for the GOP as it debates the party's message in the wake of disappointing losses last November for the White House and in the Senate. 
Now just 22% of Americans, nearly a record low, consider themselves Republicans. 
And those automatic spending cuts, known as the sequester, that are poised to take effect next week? 
If no deal is reached to avert them, half of Americans say congressional Republicans will be more to blame. Less than a third would blame Obama first. 
"On many of the issues, President Obama has staked out positions that seem to be closer to the public's thinking than the positions Republicans have staked out," says Michael 

Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The poll is the first in a new partnership between Pew and USA TODAY. "The challenge for him is in 

building the public's sense of immediacy on some of these issues, particularly on climate change and guns." 
Republicans have the opposite challenge. "Their focus on the deficit is in tune with the public's priorities right now," he says. "Yet their positions are not quite in step with the 
kind of compromises that the public tells us they want to see." 

To be sure, Obama faces his own challenges. 

His approval ratings for handling seven specific issues are no better than lukewarm, ranging from a low of 34% on the deficit to a high of 46% on the situation in Afghanistan. 
On the central issue of managing the economy, 40% approve and 56% disapprove. 
Americans also continue to be deeply unhappy with the country's direction. By 2-to-1, 64%-31%, they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States. 
Even so, those surveyed say by narrow margins that Obama has a better approach than congressional Republicans for dealing with the deficit and guns. By double digits, they 

favor his plans on immigration and climate change, including limits on emissions from power plants. 

The president's overall job approval rating is 51%, a bit higher than it typically has been for the past three years. The approval rating for Republican congressional leaders is a 
dismal 25%. Democratic congressional leaders stand in-between, at 37%. 
The telephone poll of 1,504 adults was taken by land line and cellphone Feb. 13-18. It has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points. 
Since winning re-election, Obama has outlined bolder policies and taken a less compromising stance toward the GOP lawmakers he blames for frustrating much of his legislative 

agenda over the past two years. In his inaugural address and State of the Union speech, and at events across the country, he has focused more on generating public support for 

his proposals than on forging ties with Congress to negotiate them. 
"I think there is a fresh start," says Sue Mohler, 60, of Nashua, N.H., who works in computer IT support. An Obama supporter, she was among those called in the poll. "It's not 
as big a fresh start as we would like it to be, but I'm hopeful. I'm not as pessimistic as I was." She says she's encouraged by signs that Republican leaders are ready to shift 
their stance on issues such as immigration. 

For her part, Lynn Wright, 47, a homemaker from Richlands, N.C., doesn't appreciate Obama's more combative tone. "I really feel like his feet are very, very, very buried in the 
sand," she said in a follow-up interview. "I did not vote for him, but yes, he did win. But I just don't see how he can say, 'OK, this is my time now; you guys can't tell me no.'" 
Red flags on red ink 
There is bipartisan agreement on this: Dealing with the budget deficit is urgent. 

That's a change. When Obama took office in 2009, during a cascading financial crisis, Americans put deficit reduction in the middle of a list of policy goals in a Pew poll. Now it has risen near the top. Seven of 10 Americans (including not only 81% of Republicans but also 65% of Democrats) say it is essential for the president and Congress to enact major deficit legislation this year. 
Just 4% say nothing needs to be done within the next few years. 
In the wake of the Great Recession, the deficit as a percentage of the economy has spiked to its highest levels since the years following World War II. Now, after four years of 
topping $1 trillion, the shortfall this year is projected at $845 billion by the Congressional Budget Office. 
When asked which of four issues was most pressing -- the deficit, guns, immigration or climate change -- 51% chose the deficit, three times that of any other issue. However, 

there were some significant differences by race and ethnicity. Hispanics were inclined to choose immigration as the most critical issue; African Americans chose guns. 
"The biggest thing is the deficit," declares Rennie Woodhouse, 49, a foundry supervisor in Wellsboro, Pa. "I just think we're getting further and further in the hole." 
To begin digging out, three of four Americans say a deficit plan should include both tax increases and spending cuts, akin to the "balanced" approach Obama backs. While there 

is stronger support to cut spending than raise taxes, only one in five say a deficit-reduction package should rely solely on spending cuts, the position embraced by House 

Speaker John Boehner. 
By almost 3-to-1, 71%-26%, those surveyed favor Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour from the current $7.25. On this issue, as on some others, the 
GOP faces divisions in its ranks: Those who agree with the Tea Party movement oppose the idea 2-to-1. Those who don't agree with the Tea Party support it by nearly as wide a 
gap. 

The potential impact on national security from Pentagon cuts included in the sequestration worries Travis Petry, 34, a courier who lives in Lafayette, La. "North Korea, they're 

test-firing nukes, and the Middle East in general -- it's always a problem down there," he says. 
But he doesn't expect the president and Congress to succeed in reaching a deal to avoid the across-the-board cuts, scheduled to take effect March 1. "Both sides are just 
hardheaded," he says. "Neither is going to compromise. It's business as usual." 

Most Americans aren't paying much attention to the looming deadline despite dire warnings by Obama on Tuesday that jobs could be lost and communities hurt by what he 
called "meat-cleaver" cuts. Only about a quarter of those surveyed say they have heard a lot about it. That's half the number who had heard a lot about the debt-ceiling 
showdown at a similar point last summer. 

If the president and Congress can't reach a budget deal by next week, half of Americans say they should delay the spending cuts. But a significant number, four in 10, say the 

cuts should be allowed to go into effect. 
That attitude could reflect "crisis fatigue," Dimock says. "They've seen one crisis after another, and now they're told yet another one is coming. A pretty large share of them, 
even a third of Democrats, are saying, 'Just let it happen.' They're throwing up their hands." 

An immigration divide 

A 51% majority of Americans say it's essential for the president and Congress to pass a sweeping immigration bill this year, and nearly everybody, nine in 10, say a major bill is 
needed within the next few years. 
But to do what? 
One in four want the bill to focus on better border security -- that's down 10 percentage points from a year ago -- and another one in four want the focus to be on creating a 

pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in this country. Nearly half of those surveyed, 47%, say both should be equal priorities. 
There is a predictable partisan divide on the issue: Democrats want a pathway to citizenship while Republicans back stronger security and enforcement of existing immigration 

laws. That could create problems for Republican leaders, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who are working on bipartisan bills that would include a path to legal status for 
illegal immigrants as well as border security measures. 
By a wide margin, 50%-33%, Obama's approach to immigration is preferred over the GOP. 
For Obama, having higher ratings than congressional Republicans doesn't guarantee passage of any legislation, given the polarization in a divided Congress. But it does put him 

in a stronger position to bring public pressure on lawmakers. And it complicates Republican efforts to unite a fractured party behind a message that will appeal to voters. 

"Lots of things need to be passed in Congress, and it seems everything is a filibuster," says Jaime Cortez, 23, of Edinburg, Texas. "I know a lot of strong, far-right Republicans, 
but I just think they need to ease up and listen to the public's opinion." 
While most Americans want action on the deficit and immigration this year, Obama faces a more difficult task in pressing two other priorities he's outlined, on gun control and 

climate change. 

On climate change, only a third of those surveyed say action is urgent this year. Still, Americans do back stricter emission limits on power plants, a step Obama has discussed, 
by more than 2-to-1. By 54%-34%, they support developing alternative sources of energy over expanding production of oil and coal. 
On gun control, 71% of Democrats say it's essential to pass legislation this year but only 19% of Republicans agree. Among independents, 42% want action this year. 
Monte Latham, 41, of Jacksonville, says the economy should be the top issue, but he ranks gun legislation close behind. A Navy veteran now studying nursing, he says he hopes 

supporters push for action while memories of the December shootings in Newtown, Conn., are fresh. 
"If gun control takes a back seat," he worries, "it's just going to lose that momentum."

Full Text 
Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson said Thursday that she's stepping down after a four-year tenure marked by her agency's first greenhouse gas regulations and repeated battles with industry groups and GOP lawmakers. 
Jackson, the first African American to serve as EPA administrator, came into office with bold plans to address climate change but accomplished only part of her agenda, foiled by opposition on Capitol Hill and occasionally the White House. 
She often faced harsh congressional grilling. Last year, the GOP chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, said she would need her own parking spot at the Capitol because he planned to summon her often for questioning. 
Jackson, 50, a chemical engineer by training and a mom of two teens, offered no reason for her resignation other than saying she's ready for "new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference." She said she was leaving the EPA "confident the ship is sailing in the right direction." 
Her departure, set to occur after President Obama's State of the Union address in January, comes amid other turnover that's common between presidential terms. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is leaving, as is Jane Lubchenco, the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Others, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu, are likely to follow. 
"It's unusual for administrators to stay for more than one term. These jobs are grueling, non-stop," said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
"She's been an outspoken fighter for environmental protection," he said, noting the EPA's signature finding that carbon dioxide and five other gases that contribute to climate change qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. 
That "endangerment finding," which has withstood the industry's court challenges, enabled the EPA to set new emission standards for cars and light trucks. The standards require new models to nearly double miles per gallon by 2025. In March, the EPA proposed emissions limits for new power plants, making it difficult to build coal-fired ones. 
Under Jackson's tenure, the EPA set the first standards for emitting mercury, arsenic and other toxins from power plants; this month, it finalized tougher limits for emitting fine-particle soot from smokestacks, wood-burning stoves and diesel vehicles. 
These rules won plaudits from environmentalists but rarely from industry. Howard Feldman of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil industry, said the soot standard could harm the U.S. economic recovery. "We fear this new rule may be just the beginning of a 'regulatory cliff,'" he said. 
House Republicans, including Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., have tried to thwart or delay the EPA rules, arguing they'll increase unemployment, but the Senate has not gone along. 
President Obama praised Jackson in a statement Thursday, saying she has shown "an unwavering commitment to the health of our families and our children." 
Jackson also had setbacks. She pushed for a cap-and-trade bill to cap greenhouse gas emissions but allow companies to buy pollution credits from those under the limits. The bill passed the Democratic-led House in 2009 but died in the Senate. The EPA's limits on industrial pollution crossing state lines were struck down by a federal court. 
The White House delayed or weakened some of Jackson's other proposals, including a new standard for ozone pollution that she sought in summer 2011 but that Obama put off until his second term. The EPA's final standard on emissions from industrial boilers and cement factories, announced last Friday, was weaker than the originally proposed version. 
Her efforts riled industry. "The onslaught of regulations from the EPA means manufacturers will continue to see rising energy prices and skyrocketing compliance costs, which translate into few opportunities for growth and even fewer jobs," Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement last week. 
This month, at the prodding of congressional Republicans, the EPA's inspector general said he was opening an inquiry into Jackson's use of a secondary e-mail account for official business. She said she had the account -- named "Richard Windsor" after the name of her dog and her former home in Windsor Township, N.J. -- because her public e­mail address was well known. 
Jackson, a native of New Orleans who spent much of her career as a staff scientist at the EPA before heading New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection from 2006 to 2008, earned engineering degrees from Tulane and Princeton Universities. The New York Times and The Washington Post report she may be a candidate for president of Princeton.

Oil and gas boom offers big opportunities, hazards

Abstract 
Lower prices for oil and gas can undercut progress toward clean-energy sources such as wind and solar. [...]greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels remain a serious concern: 

Full Text 
By now it's not news that "fracking" underground shale formations -- cracking them open with high-pressure jets of water, chemicals and sand -- has unlocked new supplies of natural gas and oil in places such as North Dakota and Pennsylvania. 
What's surprising is how big those supplies are, and how much they might change the world. 
Here's one measure: In its latest annual forecast, released last week, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) says fracking means the USA will overtake Russia to 
become the world's largest natural gas producer by 2015 and pass Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer by 2017. 

Longer term, the forecasts get even better. By 2035, the USA could become virtually energy independent, the holy grail of every president since the 1973 Arab oil embargo created long gas lines and shocked Americans by showing them how dependent they were on foreign oil. 
Talk about dramatic change. 
Not long ago, U.S. natural gas production was lagging so badly that energy companies were planning to import huge quantities of liquefied natural gas from abroad. Now some 
of those same companies want to convert their import terminals into facilities for exporting U.S. gas. 

So much new supply of gas is coming from shale formations that futures prices, which soared to almost $13 per thousand cubic feet in 2008, dropped to little more than $2 earlier this year before rebounding to about $3.50 recently. Inexpensive natural gas has given U.S. manufacturers a competitive edge over foreign factories, helping to revive 
U.S. industry. 
The news for oil is also good, though less dramatic. U.S. oil production is expected to rise from 7.3 million barrels a day in 2010 to 10.3 million barrels a day in 2020. That should be enough to slash imports about two-thirds by 2035, making America less dependent on oil from the volatile Middle East. 
As welcome as the oil and gas boom is, like any positive development it comes with an array of caveats. 
For one thing, it doesn't portend a dramatic decline in gasoline prices for future Thanksgiving trips to grandma's house. Much more than natural gas, oil is a world market, and demand is rising rapidly in developing nations such as China and India. So unless there is a massive shift to vehicles powered by electricity or natural gas, most U.S. drivers will remain subject to the swings of international petroleum markets. 
Nor will the U.S. military be able to disengage from the Middle East, because key allies will still rely heavily on oil imports from there, or will be threatened by hostile nations such as Iran. 
The increase in fossil fuel supplies also comes with potential serious environmental costs: Fracking, if not done carefully, can strain or contaminate water supplies. Lower prices for oil and gas can undercut progress toward clean-energy sources such as wind and solar. 
Moreover, greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels remain a serious concern: The IEA's likeliest scenario for the next quarter century shows world energy demand growing by one-third and the long-term average global temperature increasing by 3.6 degrees Celsius, just short of the 4-degree rise a World Bank study says would produce catastrophic global warming. 
These hazards point to the need for careful oversight of fracking to prevent a backlash against the practice. Tight efficiency standards, combined with a continued push toward renewable energy, can also help curb demand. And for electricity production, natural gas can be a cleaner alternative to coal. 
The unexpected oil and gas boom offers the United States a unique opportunity, but one that must be handled deftly, lest its benefits be squandered.

FLOOD INSURANCE 
I'm sorry for people who lost their homes because of flooding caused by Superstorm Sandy, but there shouldn't be homes out on those barrier islands and sand bars. And for 

the federal government to be involved, it's ridiculous to allow them to rebuild on our dime. That's my tax dollars they're using. It happens time and time again, and it's got to 
stop. 
Lg Gibson 
I understand the frustration, but you can't say don't build in zones that are more prone to flooding. That's like saying don't allow people to rebuild in areas prone to tornadoes. 
I'm not saying it is right, but how many cities would no longer exist if they weren't rebuilt? 

Robin McIntosh 
This is just like New Orleans. Don't people realize that these areas are not only flood prone, but also hurricane prone? As Albert Einstein said, insanity is doing the same thing 
over and over, expecting different results. 

Ryan Vanek 
The government should get out of the flood insurance gig. Then you would see where private insurers wouldn't even think of trying to provide coverage. 
James Brost 
POWER GRID 
In summer 2003, the Northeast lost power, in addition to parts of Canada. That was due to overload or some malfunction. It's time to bring the power grid into the 21st century. 
Scott Lawrence 
If you want to bury power lines, knock yourself out. But don't bother us with demands for upgraded grids, smart grids designed to allow power companies to charge residential 

users more for using electricity during peak hours. 
As in many other so-called emergencies, I am sure environmental activists are trying to take advantage of the moment and figure out how to make that happen because of this. 
Sal Esman 
LETTERS 
Superstorm Sandy is another data point -- a very costly data point -- underscoring that climate change is a systemic cause of these catastrophes. After this year's fire, drought 

and crop failures, have we gotten the message? Are we suffering enough yet? 
Systemic causation is is not junk science. We understand that smoking is a systemic cause of lung cancer. Dumping carbon into the atmosphere is a systemic cause of climate 

change, leading to massive disruptions in our natural and economic worlds. Some voices disagree, but it would be foolish to cross our fingers and hope the oil and coal industry 
know best. 
We can turn a problem into opportunity with an elegant solution that harnesses the power of markets and businesses. 
First we factor in the true cost of burning fossil fuels by gradually instituting a fee on carbon. Second, we use that revenue to pay equal dividends to American households. 

Meanwhile the businesses race to reap profits from alternatives that meet America's needs for safe energy. It's a win-win.

POLITICS 
It's a shame that total devastation of people's livelihood has to happen before political bashing and such can be put to the side! I commend the bipartisan effort President 

Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have put forth. 
Eagle Rock 
The damage is devastating. The fact that the president viewed the damage is a meaningless photo-op. 
Ted Hodgson 
Our elected representatives working together across party lines to serve the nation. What a sight for sore eyes! 
Larry Waters 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
All of the climate change alarmists act as if this is the first hurricane to ever hit the New York/New Jersey area. That's simply not true. There have been worse storms over the 

years. As humans spread out over the planet, there is more of a chance one of these natural disasters will hit a highly populated area. 
Ron Erke 
Considering many Americans still don't believe in evolution, I don't really think climate change caused by man has a chance at being accepted by the common folk. Until the 

alternatives are profitable, we won't see the mitigation efforts we need. 
Randy Miller 
Federal assistance 
Sandy has made clear that our infrastructure needs a lot of work, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is vital to the country, that climate change is real and has 

significant negative consequences, and that President Obama has impressive leadership skills. 
Doug Larson 
Federal government is necessary. It can be wasteful, negligent, redundant, ineffective, intrusive and infuriating, but without it, we're a bunch of spokes without a wheel. 
Rich Barnes 
What many people overlook in regard to emergency response is how much money is wasted by FEMA. Like all bureaucracies, it seems to always think it knows better how to 

apply funds than local governments. 
James Corwin 
LETTERS 
Mitt Romney and President Obama mostly ignored environmental issues during the presidential debates. Megastorm Sandy may have been Mother Nature's response. 
The climate change discussion has changed. Don't lecture about polar bears and the future of the coal industry. Ask instead: "What's needed in the here and now?" For months, 

Americans have been suffering because of droughts, crop failures and extreme weather events. Give some attention to the environment. Help your neighbors.

Abstract 
[...]he touts his push to double fuel economy for new cars and light trucks by 2025, increase solar and wind energy, and eliminate $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Romney, who once stood in front of a coal plant and said it "kills people," launched a Climate Protection Plan in 2004 to reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions as part of -- in his words -- a "no regrets" policy toward climate change. 

Full Text 
He pushed to make homes and businesses more energy efficient. He offered government incentives for renewable power and, early in his administration, tried to tackle climate change with fees on excessive corporate emitters of greenhouse gases. 
President Obama? Well, it may sound like him, but it's GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts -- a blue state with a Democratic-led legislature -- from 2003 to 2007. 
The two men have fairly similar governing records on energy and environmental issues. Their campaign rhetoric, however, has differed on just about everything except boosting the nation's production of oil and natural gas. 
Obama says the United States, despite a jump in oil and gas produced during his administration, cannot drill its way to energy independence. So he touts his push to double fuel economy for new cars and light trucks by 2025, increase solar and wind energy, and eliminate $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. 
Romney, who says the key to his goal of North American energy independence by 2020 is more drilling, favors those tax breaks. He opposes tax credits for large wind producers, which Obama says he'll renew so they don't expire Dec. 31. 
Romney supports the entire Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, the northern half of which Obama has so far declined to approve. 
"There's a big difference" between the two candidates, says David Kreutzer, an energy expert at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. "There's an anti-fossil fuel thrust with this administration that would change" under Romney. 
"When it comes to our energy future, voters have a clear choice," agrees Heather Taylor-Miesle, director of the NRDC Action Fund, an environmental advocacy group. "Romney's fossil-fuels-first approach is nothing more than drill, baby, drill -- with a nice haircut," she writes, adding that Obama has supported oil drilling to an extent that her group finds "excessive." 
Romney as governor 
What puzzles some analysts, in comparing the two candidates, is Romney's past. His record as governor differs markedly from his presidential campaign positions. 
"There's a lot of similarity" between Romney's record as governor and Obama's as president, says Kateri Callahan of the Alliance to Save Energy, a non-profit group that advocates energy efficiency. She applauds both men for the work they've done. 
"He (Romney) really did drive energy efficiency into the Massachusetts economy," Callahan says, noting he backed tax credits -- up to $600 for individuals -- for homes and businesses to make efficiency upgrades. 
She says he also supported efficiency and renewable energy projects, investing $15 million of state money into the Massachusetts Green Energy Fund LP, a venture-capital firm that helped finance about a dozen companies. Three of those companies have since gone under, including solar panel manufacturer Konarka, which received $1.5 million. 
Romney, who once stood in front of a coal plant and said it "kills people," launched a Climate Protection Plan in 2004 to reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions as part of -­in his words -- a "no regrets" policy toward climate change. 
His staff drafted the country's first interstate cap-and-trade system to cut emissions, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative or RGGI. By the time RGGI was ready for his signature in late 2005, he had announced he wouldn't seek re-election, prompting speculation he might run for president. He declined to sign it, citing potential costs to state businesses. 
Romney struck a balance as governor, says Brian Gilmore of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest organization of employers. "He certainly wasn't anti-environment, but he was concerned about potential regulations and their impact on employers," says Gilmore, who was glad that Romney walked away from RGGI. 
His gubernatorial record is "kind of a tale of two stories," says David Jenkins of ConservAmerica, a GOP environmental group. He says Romney was very pro-environment in his first two years but later got "cold feet" on some initiatives such as RGGI. "He now sounds more like Rush Limbaugh than Ronald Reagan," says Jenkins, adding he won't vote for him. 
Obama's record 
Yet Jenkins says he also won't support Obama, citing disappointment that Obama didn't push hard enough to win Congress' approval of federal cap-and-trade legislation. The bill passed the House but faltered in the Senate. 
Obama has a mixed record with environmentalists. He's been criticized for pulling back an EPA proposal to limit ozone emissions linked to smog, approving the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline and failing to create new wilderness areas that would be protected from development. 
They've lauded his support of renewable energy, which has doubled its U.S. production since 2008, his mandate for doubling vehicle fuel-efficiency and his EPA rules limiting carbon-dioxide emissions from new power plants, including coal-fired ones. 
These rules have caused Obama heartburn on the campaign trail. Campaigning in coal country, where the president's popularity has plummeted, Romney has blamed Obama's EPA for putting coal miners out of work. 
"The regulations may have long-term impact" on the coal industry, but recent mine closures are due more to the plunge in prices for natural gas that make coal less cost-competitive, says Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a non-partisan research group. 
Comparing five key issues 
1. Oil/gas drilling 
Obama: Rejected the initial northern half of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to Texas, but deferred a final decision. Proposed opening more offshore areas to oil and gas drilling but maintains moratorium off the Pacific and most of the Atlantic coasts. Seeks federal safety standards for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process by which natural gas is extracted. Opposes $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. 
Romney: Approves of Keystone XL pipeline. Favors giving states the ability to regulate drilling and issue leases (even on federal land). Supports opening all federal land for oil and gas drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaskan coasts. Backs tax credits for manufacturers, including oil and gas companies. 
2. Renewable energy 
Obama: Favors renewal of the tax credit for utility-scale wind producers, slated to expire Dec. 31. Supports loan guarantees and grants for green-energy companies. 
Romney: Opposes the renewal of the wind tax credit. Criticizes Obama's stimulus bill funding for solar, wind and electric vehicle companies. 
3. Vehicle fuel efficiency 
Obama: Finalized plans, with support of major automakers, to double fuel economy for light trucks and cars, to 54.5 miles per gallon, by 2025. 
Romney: Opposes Obama's efficiency mandate, saying consumers will have to spend more on cars than they'll save by using less gas. 
4. Clean air 
Obama: Supports the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency, upheld by the Supreme Court, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Backs tougher rules for limiting emissions from old coal-fired power plants. 
Romney: Seeks to eliminate EPA's power to regulate carbon dioxide and remove its rules limiting emissions from coal plants. "I exhale carbon dioxide," he said in November in New Hampshire. "I don't want those guys (EPA) following me around with a meter to see if I'm breathing too hard." 
5. Climate change 
Obama: Believes it's serious, exacerbated by fossil fuel use and linked to extreme weather. "Climate change is not a hoax," he told the Democratic National Convention last month in Charlotte, N.C. "More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future." 
Romney: Argues there's a lack of scientific consensus on the issue. "We don't know what's causing climate change on this planet," he told the Consol Energy Center last October.

Ikea uses sun, wind to be energy independent

Full Text 
Energy independence by 2020? The idea has been touted on the U.S. presidential campaign trail, but global home furnishings retailer Ikea is announcing plans today to achieve that goal with solar and wind power. 
As more U.S. businesses go solar, the Swedish retailer says it will rely on the sun and wind to produce all the power it uses at its stores and buildings worldwide within a decade. It plans to install more rooftop solar panels, erect wind farms and reduce its energy usage by replacing 1.2 million incandescent light bulbs with 85%-more-efficient LEDs (light­emitting diodes). 
"Each roof is a power station in the making," says Steve Howard, Ikea Group's chief sustainability officer, adding that the United States has "fantastic sun as good as anywhere in the world." Ikea already has solar panels atop 34 of its 38 U.S. stores and distribution centers. 
Howard says parts of the U.S. also have great wind potential, and Ikea, which is building wind farms abroad, would like one stateside. "But we find the policy environment rather choppy," he says. Production tax credits for the U.S. wind industry are set to expire in December unless Congress renews them. 
Ikea, which announced earlier this month that it will sell only LED light bulbs in its stores by 2016, is not the first retailer to shoot for 100% renewable energy. Wal-Mart has also set that goal (without specifying a timeline), and it ranks first among U.S. companies for solar power generation, according to a survey last month by the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. Costco Wholesale ranked second, Kohl's Department Stores third, Ikea fourth and Macy's fifth. 
"The devil is in the details," says Joel Makower, executive editor of GreenBiz.com, which covers corporate sustainability efforts, about Ikea's plans. "It's great a company is trying to get its own house in order, but its house is more than its buildings," he says, adding that more than 90% of the total energy that retailers use is embedded in the supply chain -- the making and delivering of parts and products. 
Makower says renewable energy is no longer just about scoring public-relations points. "It's about mitigating risks," he says, referring to the uncertainties of energy prices and supplies. 
Howard agrees. He says Ikea, which phased out plastic bags in 2007 and stopped selling incandescent bulbs in 2010, believes energy independence is "the right thing to do," not only because it's concerned about climate change but also because it wants to protect itself against higher energy prices in the future. 
"Sustainability will decide the winners and losers in the business community," Howard says. 
GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has talked about North American energy independence by 2020, but his agenda has focused on getting there by expanding domestic oil, gas and coal production. He's called for phasing out subsidies for solar and wind, which President Obama has supported.

Poll: Support slips for measures aimed at curbing global warming

Abstract 
The average drop in support for these policies was about 7 percentage points among those who identified as Democrats or independents vs. 14 points for Republicans. Since Republican Sen. John McCain expressed support for steps to slow global warming during the 2008 presidential race, "we have seen a significant shift in political rhetoric in the primary races in Republican debates," Krosnick says. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 5/10/2012: A story Tuesday about voter views on climate change failed to clarify that Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., opposed climate change-related legislation in 2009 but is open to other proposals to address global warming. 
From gas-mileage standards to tax breaks for windmills, public support for "green" energy measures to tackle global warming has dropped significantly in the past two years, particularly among Republicans, a new poll suggests. 
Majorities still favor most such tax breaks or restrictions on industry, according to the Stanford University poll. It shows 65% support gas-mileage standards and 73% support tax breaks for wind and solar power. But just 43% support tax breaks for nuclear power and 18% support hiking taxes on home electricity. 
Overall, support for various steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions has dropped an average of 10 percentage points since 2010, from 72% to 62%, lead researcher Jon Krosnick says. "Most Americans (62%) still support industry taking steps aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions," Krosnick says, "but they hate the idea of consumer taxes to do it." His group's nationwide polls compared responses from 1,001 people in 2010 to 1,428 people this year. 
In 2010, the National Academy of Sciences called for "strong federal policies" to curb greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, such as oil, gasoline, coal and natural gas. It warned that "climate change is occurring" and said these fuels are partly to blame. 
Public opinion experts, including Drexel University's Robert Brulle, point to declining news coverage of global warming for the falling support of steps to fight greenhouse gases; others cite the economy's doldrums. 
Krosnick suggests that distrust of environmental scientists among Republican voters (41%) may explain much of the drop. Such distrust was not seen as strongly among independent (31%) and Democratic voters (16%), he says. The average drop in support for these policies was about 7 percentage points among those who identified as Democrats or independents vs. 14 points for Republicans. 
Since Republican Sen. John McCain expressed support for steps to slow global warming during the 2008 presidential race, "we have seen a significant shift in political rhetoric in the primary races in Republican debates," Krosnick says. (McCain says he no longer supports such steps.) 
Brulle says the effect of the economy on views about climate change needs to be more carefully studied. 
Even if the public supports fixes for global warming, Brulle says, "opinion on climate change and environmental issues overall" has consistently been a low priority. Just 1% of people ranked the environment as a "top concern" in a Gallup Poll in March.

Rule means coal plants must limit pollutants: Critics say industry will be damaged

Full Text 
The Obama administration forged ahead Tuesday with the first limits on heat-trapping pollution from new power plants, ignoring protests from the industry and Republicans, who have said the regulation will raise electricity prices and kill off coal, the dominant U.S. energy source. 
But the proposal also fell short of environmentalists' hopes because it goes easier than it could have on coal-fired power, one of the largest sources of the gases blamed for global warming. 
"The standard will check the previously uncontrolled amount (of carbon pollution) that power plants release into our atmosphere," Lisa Jackson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Tuesday. But "it also creates a path forward for future facilities to use technology that burns coal, while releasing less carbon pollution." 
Older coal-fired power plants have been shutting down across the country, thanks to low natural gas prices, demand from China driving up coal's price and weaker demand for electricity. 
Regulations from the EPA to control pollution and toxic emissions from power plants have also helped push some into retirement, causing Republicans to claim the agency will cause blackouts. Numerous studies and an AP survey of power plant operators have shown that is not the case. 
But on Tuesday, GOP leaders once again accused the administration of clamping down on cheap, home-grown sources of energy. 
"This rule is part of the Obama administration's aggressive plan to change America's energy portfolio and eliminate coal as a source of affordable, reliable electricity generation," said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. 
The rule announced Tuesday could either derail or jump-start plans for 15 new coal-fired power plants in 10 states, depending on when they start construction. Those that break ground in the next year would be exempt from the new limit. Those that start construction later will have to eventually comply with the rule. 
Existing power plants, even if they make changes that increase emissions, aren't covered at all. And new ones would have years to meet the standard and could average their emissions over three decades to meet the threshold. 
But eventually, all coal-fired power plants would need to install equipment to capture half of their carbon pollution. The EPA projects that by 2030, no new coal-fired power plant will be built without carbon capture and storage.

Abstract 
Congress and voters refuse to address: A more diversified energy policy is the only way to prevent high gas prices from perennially hanging over the American economy.

The Dallas Morning News, in an editorial: "Gasoline prices are up squeezing budgets, hurting businesses and leading to calls for someone in power to do something to ease the pain. Realistically, there are no good short-term solutions to the current increase, just a barrel full of bad ones. The long-term answer is a painfully obvious one, but one the White House, Congress and voters refuse to address: A more diversified energy policy is the only way to prevent high gas prices from perennially hanging over the American economy. This means more drilling for oil and natural gas; better conservation practices; tougher fuel mileage standards; and wind, solar, geothermal, nuclear and other alternative energy sources." Jonah Goldberg, on National Review Online: "The dilemma (for President Obama) is that he's invested so much of his prestige in his energy policies that he can't admit those policies have been an abject failure. But he also can't have people thinking his policies are responsible for the energy price Americans care about most: gasoline. . . . Obama often says, Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years.' 
That's true: It's also true that under Obama's 
administration, Snooki from Jersey Shore got pregnant and Charlie Sheen lost his job. And he can take about as much credit for those developments. Never mind that if he'd gotten the cap-and-trade proposals he campaigned on, energy prices would be even worse." Froma Harrop, on Real Clear Politics: "As Americans find ways to burn less energy in their cars and in their homes, price increases don't hurt as much as before. That is why the prospect of higher gas prices this summer does not have Americans grabbing their children and screaming for deliverance from the Oval Office. They have become a bit less sensitive to energy costs. . . . In a recent Washington Post/Pew Research poll, fewer than one in five blamed the president for higher gas prices. A slightly larger number, nearly one in four, said they did not know whom or what to blame. May we suggest market forces? Demand from China and India continues to rise. The American economy is improving, and driving increases as the weather up north begins to turn warm." Sen. Dick Lugar, on Politico: "The global oil market is likely to remain precarious for the foreseeable future. So our energy policy needs clear direction in reducing the threats to our economy, and our national security, from potential oil shocks. That means we need to ramp up safe, reliable production of domestic oil, including through enhanced oil recovery. We also must promote more private investment in alternative fuels produced from biomass and coal by removing burdensome regulations. We also need a clear and flexible policy encouraging automobile innovation to boost fuel efficiency." Howard Gleckman, in The Christian Science Monitor: "In an election year, Obama may be the last guy who wants gas prices to rise. However, if we want to reduce our need for foreign oil, slow climate change . . . and encourage development of new energy technology, we ought to 
be raising taxes on fossil fuels.Alot. . . . Sensible energy policy goes beyond just taxing fossil fuels. It also means dumping competing subsidies for oil and gas on one hand and alternative energy on the other. . . . Carbon taxes enjoy the support of nearly all mainstream economists, regardless of ideology. But most Americans, who seemingly love their cars more than their spouses, are unconvinced. For them, fuel, like health care, ought to be plentiful and cheap."

Abstract 
[...] only 15% of the public knows that 97% of climate scientists have concluded that the planet is rapidly warming as a result of human activity. 

Full Text 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry's recent assertion that the science of climate change has been politicized is almost certainly true. Environmental groups (the kind that always gave me F's on my congressional report cards for voting against bills such as cap-and-trade) decided a while back to run this play on the left side of the political field. But perhaps the strongest proof of Perry's assertion is what we conservatives are doing now. 
Aided by energized climate deniers on talk TV and radio, we're driving a powerful wedge that divides God-fearing, red-meat eating Republicans from the arugula-eating bed-wetters we see on the left. Wedges work. And yet we aspire to bring America together? 
Perry asserts, and many conservatives believe, that the flow of grants have produced a corresponding flow of studies indicating human causes of climate change. Skepticism is warranted, but it's relieved by an observation: Scientists become famous by disproving the consensus, not by parroting it. You don't get a theory named for yourself by writing papers that say, "Yeah, like he said." You become famous (and, for the pure of heart, you advance science) by breaking through with new understandings. 
Grasping at outliers 
In the zeal of our disproof, many conservatives have latched on to the outliers to create the appearance of uncertainty where little uncertainty exists. Accordingly, only 15% of the public knows that 97% of climate scientists have concluded that the planet is rapidly warming as a result of human activity. 
Perhaps we could be forgiven for this data manipulation if we were attempting to deliver the nation from some greater ill. Many conservatives believe that, even if climate change is caused by human activity, the costs of correction outweigh the benefits. What does that calculation say about our objectivity, our commitment to accountability and our belief in free markets? 
But at what cost? 
Conservatives say that free enterprise, not government mandates, can deliver innovation. But we've been waiting since 1973 to be freed from foreign oil. Maybe that's because all the costs aren't "in" on petroleum -- the national security risk, the costs of protecting the supply lines out of the Middle East, the cost of the pollution from tailpipes and the cost of tax subsidies for petroleum. If those costs were paid at the pump and not out of sight, we'd be aware of our need, and America's entrepreneurs would meet our need with new fuels. 
But markets can't respond when some fuels escape accountability. If the coal industry, for instance, were held accountable for all of coal's costs -- including health effects -­we'd build emission-free nuclear power plants instead of coal-fired plants. Electricity rates would rise because we'd be paying all of coal's cost at the meter, but health insurance premiums would fall. In such an all-costs-in scenario, the profit motive would drive innovation just as it drove innovation with the Internet and the PC -- without clumsy government mandates. 
Conservatives can restore our objectivity by acknowledging that Americans are already paying all the hidden costs of energy. We can prove our commitment to accountability by properly attaching all costs to all fuels. We can prove our belief in free markets by eliminating all subsidies and letting the free enterprise system sort out winners and losers among competing fuels. 
Or, more cynically, we can attempt to disprove science, protect the fossilized and deprive America of a muscular, free enterprise, no-growth-of-government alternative to cap and trade.

Fuel choices by governments, manufacturers, individual consumers and entrepreneurs willing to invest in big-ticket change will obviously determine the future quality of life in nation after nation -- and might even determine if life on Earth will become extinct sooner rather than later.

The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World 
By Daniel Yergin, Penguin Press, 804 pages, $37.95 
As Americans build bigger and bigger mansions, design taller and taller skyscrapers, drive larger and larger SUVs, power more and more appliances, and citizens in other nations such as China develop residential and commercial needs that expand each year, can the Earth yield enough oil to fuel such growth? 
Daniel Yergin is an expert on such matters, and he says the answer is yes, at least for a long, long time. At the end of 2009, "The world's proved oil reserves were 1.5 trillion barrels, slightly more than at the beginning of that year," Yergin says in The Quest. He seems certain "that the world is clearly not running out of oil. Far from it. The estimates for the world's total stock of oil keep growing." 
But while optimistic, Yergin is no Pollyanna, no single-minded driller without an appreciation of the costs that oil exploration, drilling, transportation and consumption extract. 
As a result, The Quest is a book -- a tour de force, really -- that evaluates the alternatives to oil so broadly and deeply that the physical tome could double as a doorstop. 
Plenty of readers live a "black-box" existence. They don't really understand how skyscrapers stay upright, how a sirloin steak reaches our dinner plate (food appears magically in supermarkets, right?) and how the lights come on at the flip of a wall switch in the bedroom. Yergin's book about energy past, present and future, if studied carefully, will remove the black-box mentality at the light switch. 
Twenty years ago, Yergin completed his book The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power. That book became the standard guide for a lay audience to learn about what we loosely refer to as "the oil industry." It won accolades; it served as the basis for an oft-watched television series. 
The Quest pretty much picks up where The Prize left off. Like The Prize, the new book is fact-filled -- and though well written, requires lots of brain power and lots of time to complete. It is best read slowly, perhaps one chapter per day maximum, if the goal is to actually absorb the rich detail and sometimes complicated workings described by Yergin. 
Fuel choices by governments, manufacturers, individual consumers and entrepreneurs willing to invest in big-ticket change will obviously determine the future quality of life in nation after nation -- and might even determine if life on Earth will become extinct sooner rather than later. 
Whether to depend on oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear-generated power, renewables (energy driven by the sun or the wind, for example) is not at all obvious. A decision driven by monetary factors will come out differently than a decision driven by environmental factors. 
A realistic calculation of energy conservation is vital to the decision making, too. If individuals choose to use significantly less electricity in their homes, businesses and automobiles, the impact could be huge. But who can predict how many individuals are willing to conserve, thereby reducing their perception of a comfortable existence? 
Recent history yields a pessimistic outlook about reducing energy consumption by most humans; selfishness seems to trump sacrifice again and again. Not even energy optimists like Yergin can find great solace in the me-first attitudes of so many privileged, educated men and women in the nations generally labeled as "developed." 
The book becomes substantially more headache-producing as Yergin does his best to evaluate the undeniable reality of global warming within the framework of fuel choice. Like the best teachers in school classrooms, Yergin sees his primary mission as one of relatively objective education. What each reader does with that useful education is an individual decision, shot through with consequences.

When fear wins, we all lose: Japan's ongoing nuclear crisis illustrates how a little information can become a very dangerous thing.

Abstract 
A conservative estimate is that particulate pollution from power generation kills 3,000 to 4,000 Americans a year. Since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, which eventually could take 4,000 lives, particulates from coal power generation in the U.S. have killed roughly 90,000 people. 

Full Text 
As the frantic struggle to control damaged nuclear reactors in Japan shifts into a longer term battle to minimize the damage, some lessons begin to appear. One is that the fear itself could do more damage than what we're afraid of in the first place. And nuclear power is just one example. Whether the threat is radiation or vaccines or terrorism, the way we perceive and respond to risk is an inextricable mix of facts and how those facts feel. Sometimes a response to risk that feels right doesn't match the facts, and we end up making dangerous choices even as we're trying to keep ourselves safe. 
Let's start with radiation. Research by psychologists Paul Slovic and Baruch Fischhoff and others has found that there are plenty of powerful emotional reasons why our fears don't match the facts about this hazard. It causes cancer, and the more "dread" a risk causes -- in the form of pain and suffering -- the scarier it will be. 
Nuclear power radiation is imposed on us, and imposed risks worry us more than voluntary ones, such as medical radiation. Radiation is undetectable to our senses, so we feel powerless to protect ourselves, and lack of control makes anything scarier. It's human-made, which makes it scarier than natural risks, such as radiation from the sun, a far greater threat (8,700 melanoma deaths a year in the U.S. ). And nuclear radiation has been stigmatized as dangerous by high-profile catastrophic events such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, so many of us react automatically to anything we hear about "radiation" as negative. The details don't matter. Radiation equals scary. 
Fear coal, not nukes 
Of course, the details do matter. The 94,000 Japanese who were within 2 miles of ground zero at Hiroshima or Nagasaki and survived have been studied for more than 60 years. Compared with natural cancer rates, epidemiologists estimate only about 500 of those survivors, two-thirds of 1%, died prematurely from cancer caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of radiation. 
The World Health Organization estimates the maximum lifetime cancer death toll among 600,000 people exposed to radiation from Chernobyl will be 4,000, about two-thirds of 1%. Radiation is carcinogenic, but not as much as many people fear -- including some in the news media, where breathless alarmism magnifies how scary radiation feels to the rest of us. ("Radioactive Cloud Heads Towards U.S." So what? It's not dangerous.) 
The danger from using coal to make electricity, on the other hand, is far greater than we fear. A conservative estimate is that particulate pollution from power generation kills 3,000 to 4,000 Americans a year. Since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, which eventually could take 4,000 lives, particulates from coal power generation in the U.S. have killed roughly 90,000 people. But Three Mile Island and the anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s, and Chernobyl, freaked us out about nuclear power and made it much more expensive and politically difficult to build nuclear plants. Construction all but stopped, worldwide, after Chernobyl. So we ended up with an energy policy that favors coal and created a much greater risk. (And I haven't even mentioned climate change.) 
But as I said, this isn't about nuclear power. It's about how The Perception Gap between our fears and the facts can be dangerous all by itself. Here's another example: fear of vaccines. In communities where vaccination rates are dropping, all but eradicated diseases such as measles and whooping cough are coming back. And fear of vaccines forced millions of dollars to be spent researching whether vaccines cause autism, money that could have been invested in more productive research into what the actual causes of autism might be. 
What about how much fear of terrorism has cost us. A lot is being spent militarily, and by the Department of Homeland Security, to protect us from the real risk. But the invasion of Iraq has cost more than 4,000 American lives and billions of dollars, and has damaged U.S. international relationships, to fight a war 75% of Americans supported. Why? Because after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we were afraid enough to blithely believe dishonest overstatements about the danger, to us, from Saddam Hussein. 
Real dangers of stress 
There is also a higher personal danger from worrying more than the evidence suggests we need to. Biologically, worry equals stress, and chronic stress increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, weakens our immune system and makes us more susceptible to and affected by all sorts diseases (including cancer), increases the likelihood of clinical depression, and decreases fertility, memory and growth. A United Nations' 20th anniversary review of the health effects of Chernobyl found that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date." 
So what can we do about the inherent way our risk perception system can get us into trouble? The still-developing Fukushima crisis teaches lessons here, too. Yes we need to take the physical danger seriously. But we also have to realize that making ourselves feel safe by buying iodine pills, or worrying too much about a form of power that might not be as dangerous as it feels, can actually be worse for our health and safety. 
Realizing there is risk in the way we perceive risk is the first step in protecting ourselves from "fear itself."

Can geoengineering put the freeze on global warming?: Ocean fertilization, space mirrors are among proposals

Abstract 
With 2010 tying as the world's warmest year on record and efforts to slow greenhouse gas emissions looking stymied, calls are rising for research into engineering our way out of global warming -- everything from launching solar shade spacecraft to genetically engineering green deserts. An international consortium of 12 universities and research institutes on Tuesday, for example, announced plans to pioneer large-scale "ocean fertilization" experiments aimed at using the sea to pull more greenhouse gases out of the sky. 

Full Text 
Scientists call it "geoengineering," but in plain speak, it means things like this: blasting tons of sulfate particles into the sky to reflect sunlight away from Earth; filling the ocean with iron filings to grow plankton that will suck up carbon; even dimming sunlight with space shades. 
Each brings its own set of risks, but in a world fretting about the consequences of global warming, are these ideas whose time has come? 
With 2010 tying as the world's warmest year on record and efforts to slow greenhouse gas emissions looking stymied, calls are rising for research into engineering our way out of global warming -- everything from launching solar shade spacecraft to genetically engineering green deserts. An international consortium of 12 universities and research institutes on Tuesday, for example, announced plans to pioneer large-scale "ocean fertilization" experiments aimed at using the sea to pull more greenhouse gases out of the sky. 
Once the domain of scientists' off-hours schemes scrawled on cocktail napkins, such geoengineering is getting a serious look in the political realm. 
"We're moving into a different kind of world," says environmental economist Scott Barrett of Columbia University. "Better we turn to asking if 'geoengineering' could work, than waiting until it becomes a necessity." 
A National Academy of Sciences' best estimate has global warming bumping up average temperatures by 3 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Meanwhile, greenhouse gas emissions that are largely responsible, most from burning the modern economy's main fuels, coal and oil, look set to continue to rise for the next quarter-century, according to Energy Information Agency estimates. 
"That's where geoengineering comes in," says international relations expert David Victor of the University of California-San Diego. "Research into geoengineering creates another option for the public." 
Geoengineering takes its cue from the natural experiment that actually had made the only dent in global warming's rise in the last two decades -- the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which blasted more than 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide 21 miles high, straight into the stratosphere. The stratosphere suspended those sulfur particles in the air worldwide, where the haze they created scattered and reflected sunlight away from the Earth and cooled global atmospheric temperatures nearly 0.7 to 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit in 1992 and 1993, before finally washing out, according to NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates. Firing about half that much sulfur into the stratosphere every year for 30 years would help stabilize global warming's rise, National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Tom Wigley estimated in a much-debated 2006 Science journal report. 
Humanity would effectively become addicted to sky-borne sulfates to keep the cooling on track. The tradeoff is that rain and snow patterns would likely shift, a 2008 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study found, consigning hundreds of millions of the poorest people on the planet in Africa and Asia to recurring drought. 
No longer eyed askance 
"Geoengineering is no longer a taboo topic at scientific meetings. They are looking at it as one more policy prescription," says Science magazine reporter Eli Kintisch, author of Hack the Planet: Science's Best Hope -- Or Worst Nightmare -- For Averting Climate Catastrophe. "But it is yet to become a household word." 
That may be changing, as the terms of debate about geoengineering become clear. On the pro-research side, this October the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology called for more research into geoengineering, "to better understand which technologies or methods, if any, represent viable stopgap strategies for managing our changing climate and which pose unacceptable risks." On the more cautious side, a United Nations Environment Programme species conservation meeting in Nagoya, Japan, ended that same month with a call for, "no climate-related geoengineering activities," without environmental and scientific review. 
What are the actual geoengineering proposals? Broadly, they come in two flavors: those that deal with greenhouse gases directly by soaking up carbon dioxide (the greenhouse gas with the biggest warming impact); and those that seek to limit the sunlight that warms those greenhouse gases. Here's a sampling, from the deep ocean to deep space: 
*Ocean fertilization. Dumping iron filings into the ocean to spur phytoplankton blooms is the saltwater version of forestation. The increased mass of the plankton's cells would swell with carbon pulled from the air. On the downside, it may kill fish, belch out other greenhouse gases such as methane, and hasn't worked very well in small trials. 
*Forestation. Intense planting of trees and reclaiming deserts with hardier plants is one of the ideas endorsed at the recent Cancun, Mexico, climate meeting, where representatives of 192 nations made some progress on an international climate agreement. More fantastic versions, endorsed by Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson, would rely on genetic engineering to produce trees that act as natural carbon scrubbers, their trunks swollen with carbon pulled from the air. 
*Cloud engineering. Painting rooftops white, genetically engineering crops to have shinier surfaces, and floating blocks of white Styrofoam in the oceans are all proposals to mimic the effects of clouds, whose white surfaces reflect sunlight. Pumping sea salt into the sky from thousands of "spray ships" could increase clouds themselves. Cost-effectiveness aside, such cloud-seeding might end up dumping rain on the ocean or already soggy regions, instead of where it's needed. 
*Pinatubo a-go-go. As mentioned above, sulfur aerosols could be fired into the sky by cannons, released by balloons or dropped from planes. 
*Space mirrors. Hundreds of thousands of thin reflective yard-long disks fired into a gravitational balance point between the sun and Earth could dim sunlight. Cost aside, rocket failures or collisions might lead to a tremendous orbital debris cloud circling the Earth. And a recent Geophysical Research Letters space tourism report suggests the rocket fuel burned to launch the needed number of shades would dump enough black soot -- which absorbs sunlight and heats the atmosphere -- to increase average global temperatures about 1.4 degrees. 
"Most of the technologies are not yet proven and are at the theoretical or research phase," an August Congressional Research Service report noted. 
On the environmental side, cutting temperature increases through these techniques may still shift rain and snow patterns, leaving the planet cooler, but it could also trigger droughts across vast swaths of farmland in Africa and India. Further, ocean fertilization could contribute to mass killing of sea life and releases of methane greenhouse gas, while using sulfur aerosols could bring not only drought but also enlarged ozone holes. 
Leaving aside the environmental risks each one carries, the estimated costs tend to increase with how quickly each method removes carbon or deflects sunlight. The space reflectors would top the bill at a cost of several trillion dollars over 25 years. 
"Geoengineering technologies, once developed, may enable short-sighted and unwise deployment, with potentially serious unforeseen consequences," said a 2009 American Meteorological Society statement. Turning over weather management to human beings raises, "legal, ethical, diplomatic, and even national security concerns," the statement added. Deflected storm tracks could result in floods such as the ones hitting Australia last month or Pakistan last year. And simply cutting temperatures won't stop the rise in ocean acidification arising from increased carbon dioxide levels in the air, which may affect marine life underlying the ocean food web. 
Simply putting a worldwide price on carbon emissions from smokestacks and letting the marketplace lead to lower carbon emissions would likely be cheaper and more sensible than geoengineering, says Barrett, the economist. "But let's face it. We're talking about (geoengineering) because we don't have a price on carbon." 
That's why geoengineering could happen before a global climate treaty ever passes the U.S. Senate, suggests Victor. International climate talks rest on getting 192 self-interested and short-sighted nations to cooperate in ways that will benefit some and cost others, particularly coal-powered ones such as the United States and China. But with geoengineering, you only need one nation to start "hacking," or geoengineering, the planet. 
"It would be not at all surprising to wake up one morning and discover that Chinese testing (of geoengineering) has begun on a large scale," Victor says. "That would freak everyone out and create huge international tensions." 
No international treaty governs geoengineering, other than a 2008 amendment to ocean pollution agreements limiting ocean fertilization to research studies. 
Still a foreign concept to many 
A Yale University survey of 1,001 people nationwide last year found that 1% could correctly describe geoengineering. The field needs to be researched, suggests climate scientist Michael MacCracken of the Climate Institute in Washington, D.C., before opinions harden without accurate information. Geoengineering at this point looks like one of many options in addressing climate change, MacCracken adds. "You can only geoengineer so much before the side effects become so much worse than the cure that it doesn't make sense to bother." 
He and others argue geoengineering research should begin in earnest, before some abrupt climate change, such as Greenland's ice sheet melting precipitously, stampedes the world into an overreaction and rush to costly technology as a quick, untested fix. 
"No research is really going on in a lot of these areas," he says, raising the prospect of a lot of fruitless or counterproductive climate engineering efforts suddenly sprouting in a global panic about collapsing ice sheets decades from now. 
Global warming by itself is a kind of geoengineering, noted as far back as 1896 by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, who calculated that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide (the most noted greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels would likely warm the atmosphere by 9 degrees. Arrhenius supposed that would take thousands of years to happen, based on fossil fuel use rates at the turn of the century. Instead, the global average temperature has warmed about 1.4 degrees since he made his estimate, as carbon dioxide levels have increased tremendously, and his 9-degree increase is now within the range of forecasts for 2100. 
"I think it is settled that some climate engineering research will go forward," Kintisch says. "We haven't seen it enter the national debate yet. Hard to know what will happen when it does. That may be the biggest question."

Full Text 
The talking heads spent much of Wednesday chewing over what President Obama said in his State of the Union speech. Far less discussed was what the president didn't say. 
Two omissions in particular were glaring. 
Obama uttered nary a word about gun control, despite the recent shooting spree in Tucson that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords gravely wounded and killed six people, including 9­year-old Christina-Taylor Green, whose parents and brother sat in the first lady's box. 
Nor did the words "global warming" or "climate change" pass the president's lips, despite what Obama, in last year's address, called the "overwhelming scientific evidence." Instead, this year he called for clean-energy initiatives that would, among other things, "protect our planet." 
Politically, Obama has good reasons to duck these hot-button issues when he's trying to shift toward the center. The National Rifle Association has made talk of gun control radioactive. And efforts to control greenhouse gasses are dead in the GOP-controlled House. 
But still. Would it have been so tough for Obama to call for stepped-up efforts to separate mentally ill individuals from rapid-fire weapons? Or to endorse a ban on the sort of 31-bullet clips used by accused Arizona shooter Jared Loughner? After all, such magazines were included in the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004 -- a ban that Obama, in his 2008 campaign, said he wanted to reinstate. 
As for climate change, perhaps the middle of an usually cold and snowy winter wasn't the best time to raise it. But the threat remains. Worldwide, 2010 was the warmest year on record. 
Skepticism about proposed solutions is one thing; denial of the clear-cut science, the position of many newly elected Republican lawmakers, is quite another. Even if an all-out attack on the problem isn't in the cards, Obama can promote interim steps as complex as clean-coal technology or as simple as painting rooftops white to reflect the sun. 
When difficult issues arise, a president is supposed to lead, not bend to the prevailing winds or to powerful lobbies.

Full Text 
The fight over U.S. environmental policy will shift next year as Republicans take control of the House of Representatives, leaving the Obama administration chasing smaller victories in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
What's dead for now is the ambitious climate bill that President Obama had backed, which sought to commit the U.S. to reduce industrial pollution 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. Companies that came in under those caps could trade, or sell, their pollution credits to others. 
Obama couldn't get the bill passed this year when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate, and he has said he'll pursue smaller measures -- what he calls "singles" instead of "home runs" -- that could draw GOP support. 
He has cited efforts to promote electric vehicles, nuclear power, renewable energy and energy efficiency. He also has touted the Environmental Protection Agency's plans, beginning next year, to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 
In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled the EPA could regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if it deemed them pollutants, which it has done. Critics say the EPA cannot impose limits without Congress' OK. 
House Republicans, to be led by Ohio Rep. John Boehner, indicate they -- along with Democrats including Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Texas' Republican attorney general, Greg Abbott -- will challenge the EPA's authority to regulate climate-altering gases. 
"It's certainly a top priority," says Boehner spokesman Michael Steel, describing the EPA's proposed rules as a "backdoor" tax on businesses. 
That's not the only Obama challenge. Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas, seeking to chair the House Science and Technology Committee, has promised "strong oversight" of the administration in "key areas" that include climate change and energy research. 
Vying to lead the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee are several Republicans including Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, who apologized to BP this year for the political pressure it faced over the massive Gulf of Mexico spill, and Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois, who thinks the threat of global warming is overstated and who has quoted Scripture to say the Earth will end only when "God declares it is time to be over." Shimkus favors updating coal-fired plants as a way to address a warming climate, his spokesman Steve Tomaszewski says. 
"The whole atmosphere has changed dramatically in just a year," says David Kreutzer, an energy and environmental scholar at the Heritage Foundation, a think tank that has criticized Obama's cap-and-trade approach. Kreutzer says even bipartisan efforts, such as the $5 billion Home Star program to retrofit homes, will likely be challenged. He says a similar Obama effort to weatherize U.S. homes with insulation, caulking and other upgrades moved too slowly and lawmakers are less willing now to "sign a blank check." 
"This is a very volatile period," says David Goldston, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. 
"Everybody is rethinking their priorities," says Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group. He says it was a "mistake" for environmentalists to focus single­mindedly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, he says, they need to pitch their concerns as "kitchen table" issues that directly affect people. For example, he cites the presence of the estrogen-like chemical bisphenol A, or BPA, in food packaging. "That's personal to them. Climate is not," he says. 
"Climate ... seems to have become a dirty word," says Melinda Pierce, lead lobbyist for the Sierra Club. She says environmentalists need to seek smaller, specific victories. "If we talk electric cars," she says, "people find that appealing." 
The biggest environmental changes next year, however, may not come in Washington but in California, as the state moves to implement its landmark, bipartisan law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through financial incentives and its own cap-and-trade plan. Californians solidly defeated a November ballot measure, Proposition 23, that would have suspended the law.

Summit wheel-spinning: Dealing with climate change isn't a matter of will power; it's a matter of economics. Next week's meeting in Cancun should focus on real solutions.

Abstract 
If we had the requisite backbone, they insist, we'd simply stop pumping millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year as a result of our addiction to fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Since we obviously don't, they argue, we need to find some mechanism, such as imposing hefty carbon taxes, that would effectively force us to do the right thing. 

Full Text 
In a week's time, several thousand well-meaning officials from 194 countries will gather in Cancun, Mexico, for yet another global climate summit. And just as they did last year in Copenhagen, and the year before in Poznan, Poland, and in fact every year since 1995 in a variety of locales from Kyoto, Japan, to Marrakech, Morocco, they will fill the air with apocalyptic warnings about what will happen to the planet if we don't cut carbon emissions drastically. After that, they will go home, once again having done nothing meaningful about global warming. 
Why do we keep running in fruitless circles when it comes to climate change? Most climate activists will tell you it's the result of a failure of will. If we had the requisite backbone, they insist, we'd simply stop pumping millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year as a result of our addiction to fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Since we obviously don't, they argue, we need to find some mechanism, such as imposing hefty carbon taxes, that would effectively force us to do the right thing. 
Why fossil fuels? 
This notion is attractively simple, but it ignores a fundamental reality. The reason we continue to use fossil fuels is not because we're weak or lazy or enjoy annoying Al Gore. Rather, it's a matter of basic economics. As energy sources go, fossil fuels are much cheaper and more efficient than any of the green alternatives such as solar or wind power. And even as hard a climate hard-liner as James Hansen of NASA concedes, "As long as fossil fuels are the cheapest form of energy, they are going to continue to be used." 
This is why developing nations such as China and India are so resistant to the idea of drastically cutting their carbon emissions. And it's why the developed world has found it impossible to live up to any of the grand carbon-cutting promises made over the past two decades at climate summits in Rio, Kyoto, and most recently Copenhagen. It's not that Third World governments don't understand the link between greenhouse gases and global warming; it's that without the cheap energy that fossil fuels provide, there is absolutely no way they will be able to lift billions of their citizens out of poverty. And it's not that we in the West don't get the climate equation either; it's that very few of us are willing to suffer higher prices and slower economic growth. 
Fortunately, there is a way out of this impasse. Instead of trying to solve global warming by making fossil fuels cost more, why not concentrate on making the green alternatives cost less? If we could make solar and wind and other green energy technologies competitive with coal and oil, no one would have to be compelled to do anything -- everyone would switch over in a heartbeat. 
How do we bring down the cost of green energy? Think about the last great technological revolution that changed the world -- the digital one. We didn't promote the scientific breakthroughs that wound up putting PCs in hundreds of millions of homes by making slide rules and typewriters more expensive. Rather, it was the result of massive investments in research and development in areas such as solid-state physics and computer science. Why aren't we doing the same with green energy technologies? 
Taken as a whole, the nations of the world spend a paltry $2 billion a year on green energy R&D. As a result, these technologies are progressing at a snail's pace. We can (and should) do better. But it will take a real commitment -- something on the order of roughly $100 billion a year (or roughly 0.2% of global GDP) to produce the kind of game-changing breakthroughs that ushered in the digital revolution. 
'Transform our world' 
All kinds of exciting technologies could benefit from this sort of investment -- everything from artificial photosynthesis (which would enable us to store solar energy cheaply and efficiently) to fourth-generation nuclear reactors (which would consume existing nuclear waste) -- any one of which could change our future for the better. 
In the end, most of these bets probably won't pay off, but all we need to transform our world is for a few of them to work. But to do that, we first need to recognize that solving global warming isn't a matter of backbone -- it's a matter of economics. 
Bjorn Lomborg is author of The Skeptical Environmentalist and Cool It, head of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, and adjunct professor at Copenhagen Business School. Cool It, a documentary about him and his work, opened in the U.S. on Nov. 12.

Study links lower carbon emissions to recession: Levels predicted to rise again as economy rallies

Abstract 
Over the past century, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil, have added increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. 

Full Text 
Worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, widely blamed as the chief cause of global warming, dropped from 2008 to 2009, largely because of the global economic slowdown, according to a study released Sunday. It was the first decline since the late 1990s. 
The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, is part of the annual carbon budget update from the Global Carbon Project, a group of emissions experts and economists from several international environmental organizations. 
The emissions decrease of 1.3% from 2008 to 2009 was directly related to the economic crisis, says study lead author Pierre Friedlingstein of the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. "There is a close link between the world's gross domestic product and emissions of carbon dioxide," he says. 
Over the past century, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil, have added increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. Production of cement also contributes a tiny amount of carbon to the air. 
The 2009 drop was less than half of what was expected, says Friedlingstein, partly because the drop in global GDP was less than expected. The total of 30.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide was the second highest in human history, just below the 2008 emissions. 
The study projects that if the economic recovery proceeds as expected, global fossil fuel emissions will increase by more than 3% in 2010, approaching the high emissions growth rates observed from 2000 to 2008. 
Last year's worldwide decrease included significant regional differences. The largest decreases occurred in Europe, Japan and North America: 6.9% in the United States, 8.6% in the U.K., 7% in Germany, 11.8% in Japan and 8.4% in Russia. The study notes that some emerging economies recorded substantial increases in their total emissions, including 8% in China and 6.2% in India. 
Each country reports its own emission totals to the United Nations, says Friedlingstein. China remains the top emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, followed by the USA, India, Russia and Japan. 
Is the emissions drop entirely a result of the economic crisis? No, says Dan Lashof, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council climate center, who was not part of the study. "The decreases in emissions for the big countries were larger than their GDP decline," he says. "It's not just the recession." 
Lashof says concerted efforts to limit and reduce carbon emissions and invest in clean energy in countries such as Germany and the U.K. could be paying dividends. 
The fact that fewer trees are being cut down in some parts of the world is also good news. "We found global emissions from deforestation have decreased through the last decade by more than 25%, compared to the 1990s," says study co-author and Global Carbon Project executive director Pep Canadell. Cutting down trees and clearing forests -­known as deforestation -- releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as the trees rot and are burned.

Departing Congress leaves piles of unfinished business

Abstract 
Scores of lawmakers were also "honored" at fundraisers hosted by labor unions and the banking, coal mining, pharmaceutical and health care industries. While the 111th Congress has three major accomplishments -- the economic stimulus that helped avert a Depression, and landmark health care and financial reforms -- lawmakers moved to adjourn late Wednesday after failing to address just about every other pressing problem the nation faces. 

Full Text 
As Congress finishes work this week and heads home to campaign, warring Republicans and Democrats finally found a shared goal: Collecting as many contributions as possible from Washington's special interests. 
No fewer than 400 fundraisers were scheduled during Congress' final month in the capital, according to a Sunlight Foundation tally. Lobbyists could eat breakfast with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have cocktails at the Capitol Hill home of House Rules Committee Chairman Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., or dine with Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. -- for anywhere from $500 to $5,000 a pop. Scores of lawmakers were also "honored" at fundraisers hosted by labor unions and the banking, coal mining, pharmaceutical and health care industries. 
All of which leads to the question: Don't these much-honored lawmakers have any work to do? The answer is: Plenty, but they are often more interested in keeping their jobs than doing them. 
While the 111th Congress has three major accomplishments -- the economic stimulus that helped avert a Depression, and landmark health care and financial reforms -­lawmakers moved to adjourn late Wednesday after failing to address just about every other pressing problem the nation faces. 
The reason is news to no one. Each party has backed so far into its ideological corner that compromise is next to impossible. But it's worth taking a moment to tally the high human cost of their failure. 
Let's start with what should be the easy things -- issues of public health and safety. 
In the past few years, thousands of people have been made ill by contaminated spinach, hamburger, peanuts and, most recently, salmonella-tainted eggs. Some have died. In July 2009, the House voted to give the Food and Drug Administration more resources, staff and authority. But a bipartisan measure that even has the backing of much of the industry has been stalled by one senator -- Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who insists that sponsors find a way to pay for the $1.4 billion the measure will cost over five years. Coburn is right about the principle but wrong about the method. Were it not for a paralytic Senate rule that let's a single senator block the will of the other 99, the bill could be passed and paid for. Instead, more people will die. 
Keeping miners from getting blown up in unsafe workplaces should also be a slam-dunk, but it isn't. Last April, after an explosion at West Virginia's Upper Big Branch mine killed 29 miners, it became clear that regulations that are supposed to keep miners safe are instead working to the benefit of the least responsible operators. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., pushed legislation to rein in the rogues, but was unable to even get a safety measure rolling. Republicans objected, saying more negotiations are needed. So lawmakers are returning home, where the biggest danger they face is not getting re-elected. Miners, meanwhile, continue to risk their lives in places that are less safe than they could be if Congress had done its job. 
Beyond these comparatively simple regulatory matters are the tough, ideologically divisive issues on which another two years passed with little progress. 
Immigration remains so conflict-ridden that comprehensive reform remained out of reach. 
Although Congress was confronted with mounting scientific evidence of the consequences of global warming, efforts to do something about it stalled in the Senate. 
As for the federal budget deficit, the picture only grew bleaker. Gridlock allowed the estate tax to expire in 2010, providing a windfall for wealthy heirs and raising the deficit by an estimated $15 billion. Meanwhile, the rest of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of this year -- and Congress is leaving town without acting. In this case, doing nothing is preferable to extending all the tax cuts, which a debt-ridden nation can no longer afford. But the debate in Congress has been over whether tax cuts should be renewed for everyone (the GOP solution), or only the 96% of taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year (President Obama's choice). Failure to resolve the issue just leaves more uncertainty hanging over an already shaky economy. 
The overarching story of this Congress is that if Democratic majorities couldn't push something through by themselves, the job didn't get done. With neither party likely to gain a dominant majority anytime soon, current practices invite perpetual gridlock. 
This stands in contrast to earlier eras of great achievement. A Democrat-controlled Congress passed the Clean Air Act under Richard Nixon in 1970. The House, controlled by Democrats, helped pass Ronald Reagan's 1986 tax simplification. And, in 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a welfare reform package approved by a Republican-controlled Congress. 
These types of accomplishments are nearly impossible to replicate today, when filibusters are routine and a single senator often puts a "hold" on a nomination or piece of legislation. There are proposals to alter those practices, but -- you guessed it -- the changes, too, are on hold. 
The next Congress will inherit a full plate of unfinished business -- and, unless reason suddenly prevails, the pile is only going to get bigger.

Abstract 
Since April's Gulf oil spill highlighted the nation's dependence on foreign oil and the dangers of domestic exploration, Obama has sought a deal on taxing carbon pollution -­something environmentalists say is essential but most industry officials oppose. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's attempt to use the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to help propel comprehensive energy legislation has failed, but the Senate plans to unveil a 
scaled-back measure as early as next week. 
A month ago, Obama used his first Oval Office address to the nation to press for congressional action on energy and climate change legislation -- the only major piece of his 
domestic agenda that has languished in Congress. 

Yet on Tuesday, the topic didn't even come up when the president met with the Senate's Democratic leaders at the White House to discuss upcoming legislation. Instead, the 

meeting focused on financial regulation, aid for the unemployed and increasing loans to small businesses. 
The energy bill likely to emerge in the Senate won't look like the one Obama has sought since taking office. He wants to charge utilities and other companies for a portion of 
their greenhouse gas emissions as a way to reduce pollution and pay for clean energy alternatives. 

"I'm not sure the votes are there to do that in this Congress," says Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "You need to do whatever you're able to do when you're able to do it." 
Revising the bill 
Instead, the Senate bill is likely to include renewable energy standards and tax credits, tougher fuel-efficiency requirements, incentives for electric vehicles and new oil drilling 
regulations. The House of Representatives passed a more comprehensive bill, including a price on carbon pollution, last year. 

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that when the Senate takes up the bill, "I expect that the president will be active in that debate." 

Since April's Gulf oil spill highlighted the nation's dependence on foreign oil and the dangers of domestic exploration, Obama has sought a deal on taxing carbon pollution -­something environmentalists say is essential but most industry officials oppose. 
Obama told a bipartisan group of senators involved in energy policy late last month to aim high -- but not so high that they don't hit something, according to Democratic Sen. 

Tom Carper of Delaware, one of the participants. 

The problem for Obama: victories on economic stimulus, financial regulation, health care and education have eaten up much of his mandate, leaving him less able to dictate 
terms. "There's only so much political capital to go around," says Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. "Every major battle consumes a certain amount." 
"There's a little bit of legislative fatigue with expansive, huge bills," says Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Obama was able to do two things on energy last year: The $862 billion economic stimulus law included about $80 billion for renewable energy programs, and fuel-efficiency 

standards were raised for new cars and trucks. 

At the same time, Obama has signaled he's willing to oppose environmentalists by promoting loan guarantees for nuclear plants, more offshore oil drilling and clean coal 
technology. 
"The White House appears to be navigating the politics of climate and energy through the theory of unilateral disarmament," says Erich Pica of Friends of the Earth. "Who are 

they negotiating with?" Navigating the opposition White House senior adviser David Axelrod says the goal is to get a bill through a Senate where nearly all Republicans and some Democrats from manufacturing states -- such as 
Michigan's Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow and Pennsylvania's Bob Casey and Arlen Specter -- oppose raising costs on industry. "We will take the steps that are possible and 
achievable," Axelrod says. "We're not going to make the perfect be the enemy of the good, but we want to make progress." 
Some propelling factors: 

*The Deepwater Horizon oil spill presented a crisis in need of a solution. "The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now," Obama said in the June 15 Oval Office speech. 
*He pledged to foreign leaders at last December's climate change summit in Copenhagen that the U.S. would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, and 83% by 2050. "The White House has a real interest in getting this done for international reasons as well as for domestic ones," says Daniel Weiss of the Center for American Progress. 
*Last year's 219-212 House vote left moderate Democrats hanging. They voted to put a price on carbon pollution, dubbed a "national energy tax" by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. The Senate hasn't acted. The National Republican Congressional Committee is targeting more than 50 Democrats over the vote, such as Reps. Baron Hill of Indiana, Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania and Zack Space of Ohio. 
*This would be Obama's best chance to enact anything close to comprehensive energy legislation if the midterm elections follow historical patterns and hand the GOP major gains in Congress. After President Clinton failed to pass a health care bill in 1994, it took 16 years to get it done. 
Says Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defense Fund: "If we don't get it done this year, we're not coming back to it for a long, long time."

Don't use oil spill as excuse to deep-six domestic drilling: Our view: Learn from the Gulf disaster, then move ahead with exploration.

Abstract 
[...] decades of refusal to build more nuclear plants, or deal with the waste disposal issue, since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island have left the U.S. overly dependent on electricity from coal that is dangerous to mine and contributes to climate change. 

Full Text 
The easy thing to do after the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be to kill President Obama's shiny new plan to expand offshore drilling. Many formerly pro-drilling coastal politicians, from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, are calling for doing just that. 
But parochial interests and short-term thinking are the traditional ruin of U.S. energy policy. 
Decades of refusal to expand domestic drilling, or make gasoline more expensive, have left the nation addicted to foreign oil. As pretty much everyone knows by now, this is an invisible, slow-motion disaster that transfers tens of billions of dollars a year to unfriendly regimes and leaves the nation vulnerable to wars and oil shocks. 
Meanwhile, decades of refusal to build more nuclear plants, or deal with the waste disposal issue, since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island have left the U.S. overly dependent on electricity from coal that is dangerous to mine and contributes to climate change. 
So as nice as it would be to halt oil exploration along the coastline or in the Alaskan wilderness, years of feckless energy policy have forfeited that luxury. The question now isn't whether to drill, but how to do so more safely, particularly in deep water, while developing clean-energy replacements such as wind, solar and biofuels. 
If only that were easy or quick. Alternative energy provides about 6% of transportation fuel. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that 25 years from now, it will provide about 15%. Even if that doubled or tripled, the nation would still need substantial quantities of oil. 
About one-third of U.S. oil production comes from the Gulf. Curbing or killing the plan to expand offshore drilling would take off the table an estimated 40 billion to 60 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil -- about six to eight years of U.S. consumption at current rates. That oil is needed to help reduce imports and bridge to a time when more planes, trains and automobiles can run on alternative fuels. Currently, of the nearly 250 million cars and trucks on American roads, only about 700,000 run on alternative fuels. Phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles is going to be a long, slow process. 
Being stuck with petroleum for now, however, doesn't mean pursuing a heedless "drill, baby, drill" policy. The Gulf of Mexico disaster exposed the oil industry's failure to anticipate, and develop a robust response to, a deep-sea blowout. 
True, this is the first serious drilling-related spill in U.S. waters since the one off Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1969. But when BP executives say they never could have imagined the sort of accident that occurred nearly three weeks ago in the Gulf, an assertion repeated at Tuesday's finger-pointing congressional hearing into the spill, they are either misinformed or ignorant about their business. 
An industry study documented more than 100 cases of blowout-preventer failures in just two years in the 1990s -- none as serious as this one, but warning signs nonetheless. Worse, a catastrophic failure in foreign waters should have sounded alarm bells. In 1979, a blowout preventer failed to cut the flow of oil at a Mexican offshore well near the Yucatan Peninsula. That one took about 295 days to control and spilled 140 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. (An estimated 4 million gallons have spilled from the Deepwater Horizon accident.) 
Before offshore drilling expands, the industry should have to show that it is far better prepared than BP was to deal with accidents, and the government must beef up its oversight. On Tuesday, the administration announced plans to split the Minerals Management Services into one unit to enforce safety rules and a second unit to collect royalties. That would help eliminate the conflict of interest between the agency's dual missions, much as was necessary with federal oversight of the airline industry. 
Just as one plane crash doesn't mean that the nation should stop building jetliners and airports, one horrific spill can't be allowed to dictate energy policy for decades. The nation needs the oil. But it can learn from the mess in the Gulf to minimize the chances of anything like it happening again.

Good news: Cape Wind OK'd. Bad news: It took a decade.

Abstract 
The Obama administration has lately made controversial energy decisions that run against this tide, promoting construction of nuclear plants and opening offshore areas for oil and gas exploration. 

Full Text 
Several European countries long ago managed to build many offshore wind farms. But approval of the USA's first such power plant has been stalled for nearly a decade, testament to the nation's lack of seriousness about energy choices. 
On Wednesday, the Obama administration finally acted to stop the bickering, the excuse-making and the somewhere-else demands that have held up the coastal Massachusetts project known as Cape Wind. 
After weighing the objections -- which ranged from oceanfront property owners' worries about their views to more serious concerns about fishing, tourism and ancient tribal burial grounds -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he found "the public benefits weigh in favor of approving" the project. Once up and running, the 130 wind turbines in a stretch of ocean near Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket could supply an estimated 75% of the area's electricity needs. 
Salazar got it right. Energy production is about trade-offs. That has been painfully clear lately from the coal mine disaster in West Virginia, which killed 29, and the drilling rig accident in the Gulf of Mexico, which left 11 workers dead and an oil slick spreading toward the coastline. Every form of energy exacts a price, and extracting fossil fuels from the ground is particularly dangerous and dirty. Relative to the risks of coal mining and oil exploration, the downsides of offshore wind turbines seem minor. 
That's likely to be just as true at other locations where coastal waters are shallow enough to make building wind turbines economical, and where short distances to heavily populated coastal communities make building transmission lines feasible. Projects have been proposed for ocean sites off Delaware, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, plus Great Lakes sites near Chicago and Cleveland. 
But finding a way to get those and other energy projects moving is a daunting problem. It's still much easier to stop or slow an energy project -- whether it's a wind farm, an oil refinery or a nuclear power plant -- than it is to build one. Even Cape Wind isn't home free. Lawsuits and regulatory hurdles could delay the project for several more years. 
Whatever legitimacy such stalling tactics might have should be outweighed by the frighteningly steep cost of continuing the status quo. The USA gets more than half its oil from the world market, transferring hundreds of billions of dollars every year to unfriendly regimes. 
The national security cost is matched or exceeded by the environmental price. Fossil fuels, which provide 84% of U.S. energy needs, contribute to global warming. So far, the political system has balked at pricing carbon at anywhere near its true cost. Meanwhile, useful options like Cape Wind stall out because regulatory wheels turn too slowly, court battles drag on too long and parochial concerns trump the national interest. In trying to give everyone a voice, the nation instead seems to have given everyone a veto. 
The Obama administration has lately made controversial energy decisions that run against this tide, promoting construction of nuclear plants and opening offshore areas for oil and gas exploration. That's promising. What would help even more is legal framework for quicker decisions.

'Bridge fuel' ignites a debate: Natural-gas boom brings new techniques, concerns

Abstract 
A risk of runoffs "Energy and water mix hand in hand," says environmental biophysicist Susan Riha of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. With hydraulic fracturing, she says, potential risks range from the chance of chemicals such as benzene leaking into local drinking water to landscape damage to questions about who benefits from a new energy boom. Landowners who lease to well drillers see financial gains, while their neighbors worry about their drinking water wells suffering methane and chemical contamination.\n

Robert Myers spends a lot of time hiking and fishing in state forests, "places where my grandfather went hunting," he says. 
But the hiking grounds for this Lock Haven, Pa., English professor and local activist are changing with what some critics say is the threat to the environment that comes as part of the latest boom: the hunt for natural gas. And Myers hates what it's doing to the Eastern forests. "It sickens me what the gas wells are doing to the places I love." 
Energy companies increasingly are drilling into the Marcellus Shale, a mile-or-so-deep layer of methane-rich black rock stretching from Tennessee to New York. The layers of shale are being tapped for natural-gas deposits, which in turn has led to a boost in U.S. natural-gas supplies, lower energy prices for consumers and jobs in areas hit hard by unemployment. 
But the supply boom has arrived with new concerns about the potential environmental damage from techniques used to retrieve the gas. 
The debate highlights the choices the USA faces as it pursues a greener economy: If burning natural gas in place of some coal can cut carbon dioxide emissions, what environmental risks are we willing to tolerate? 
In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that a science panel would examine the safety of hydraulic fracturing, a decades-old but much-improved drilling technology behind the boom. 
Hydraulic fracturing cracks shale with water mixed with chemicals and fills the cracks with sandy grit, allowing gas trapped in the shale to bubble out. But among the environmental concerns raised by the process: chemical leaks, wear and tear on forests and roads and even minor earthquakes. 
Once the sands of an inland sea, about 20 such deposits lie in North America, filled with methane produced by the decay from the bugs, plants and animals that ended up in the ancient ooze. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable from these shales in a country that consumes about 23 trillion cubic feet a year. 
But that may be a conservative estimate: The actual amount of natural gas in the "Big Seven" deposits, which includes Marcellus and shales in Texas, Arkansas and elsewhere, may be even bigger. In 2008, Penn State geoscientist Terry Englander estimated that the Marcellus alone might have more than 516 trillion cubic feet. 
"It's a boom," says environmental engineer JeanneVan-Briesen of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "That means a lot of choices, a lot of consequences good and bad." 
Pittsburgh, for example, is where the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers meet to start the Ohio River. And two years ago, the Monongahela River's salt levels reached excessive amounts, probably in part because of the "flowback" water from new hydraulic fracturing wells draining into the river, adding to acid-laced leaks from coal mines, VanBriesen and colleagues find. 
Power plant operators along the river, who need the water for cooling, were first to detect the problem when they spotted corrosion on scrubbing equipment. Fish have died in rivers near Myers' hiking trails, which he blames on the wells. 
A risk of runoffs 
"Energy and water mix hand in hand," says environmental biophysicist Susan Riha of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. With hydraulic fracturing, she says, potential risks range from the chance of chemicals such as benzene leaking into local drinking water to landscape damage to questions about who benefits from a new energy boom. 
"I started out worried about what was happening in state forests," Myers says. "But now I see much wider effects, in streams and public safety." 
Alongside private landowners, Myers' state leases well sites on public lands to energy companies near Lock Haven. Digging a well at such sites requires clearing a 5-acre patch of forest and digging a sludge pit for the flowback water, which is often laced with salt and proprietary chemicals from the fracturing process. By 2008, more than 450 wells had been dug in Pennsylvania in three years, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 
In 2005, the Bush administration exempted gas wells from storm water discharge permits, a decision the EPA may revisit when the science review is completed. "Any time you have an open pit, you have the risk of runoffs," Riha says. 
Most prominently, the non-profit news organization ProPublica reported in a 2008 investigation more than 1,000 cases in which hydraulic-fracturing-related wells have been tied to leaks or accidents, including fires. 
Adding to debate over hydraulic fracturing, Riha says, the risks and benefits of the boom aren't doled out evenly: Landowners who lease to well drillers see financial gains, while their neighbors worry about their drinking water wells suffering methane and chemical contamination. They also have to drive on crumbling roads crowded with oversized fracturing-water trucks. 
And some of the risks might be more exotic. In March, a Leading Edge journal study led by seismologist Brian Stump of Southern Methodist University in Dallas suggested hydraulic fracturing had triggered small earthquakes in Texas in 2008 and 2009, when flowback water was "deep-injected" onto an earthquake fault, one method of getting rid of wastewater that doesn't let it flow into streams. 
"The history of the region is people exploiting the resources, ruining the wilderness, and then leaving the mess behind," says Myers, an English professor at Lock Haven (Pa.) University. 
But that's a tough argument in a region eager for jobs. "I've attended county meetings to discuss gas wells where the crowd has been pretty hostile," Myers says. "The last thing they want is a tree-hugging English professor saying they might endanger their neighbors with their lease." 
Indeed, the head of the Clinton County Economic Partnership where Lock Haven is based says the drilling has brought jobs and "new wealth" to an area with 9.5% unemployment. 
"It's like someone dropped a new bag of money" on the region, says Michael Flanagan, president and CEO of the Clinton County group. "That said, we also understand the environmental concerns" but believe they're "controllable." 
The bigger picture 
Assuming the safety of drinking water remains the central question, "there's no reason to think EPA's current study will render results that differ a whole lot from the various other studies that have been done on the subject," says Chris Tucker of Energy in Depth, a natural-gas industry group based in Washington. He notes a 2004 EPA report that found the technology "safe and well-regulated." 
Climate change makes the hydraulic fracturing debate a bigger one than just another row pitting energy companies against environmentalists. "The story in all this is how we deal with thinking through the water and climate impacts of our energy choices," VanBriesen says. 
On the climate side, natural gas produces only about half of the carbon-dioxide emissions of coal burned to produce electricity, according to the Energy Information Administration. In January, a Congressional Research Service report suggested that doubling the nation's electric power generation from gas, with a corresponding drop in coal, would reduce current coal-plant carbon dioxide emissions by 19%, lowering total U.S greenhouse gas emissions by about 6% overall. 
"We could, today, simply through the increased use of existing natural-gas fired power plants, meaningfully reduce the CO emissions of the power sector," natural gas plant chief Jack Fusco of the Calpine Corp. told senators in October. Former senator Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., head of the United Nations Foundation, has called natural gas a "bridge fuel" for switching from fossil fuels to renewable, climate-friendly-ones in this century. 
"Any changes in how we get energy are going to be disruptive," Riha says. Even wind turbines, prime examples of renewable energy, have faced opposition from landowners in New York state and Pennsylvania who are worried about their mountain views. 
"People think it is some sort of minor change switching to a green economy, but no energy system is a seamless solution without environmental impacts," Riha says. "People need to start coming to grips with the future."

Abstract 
Burns, 42, is a self-made millionaire who says he doesn't believe in man-made global warming -- a popular position in a district where there are concerns that climate change regulations will curtail the use of coal -- and wants to repeal the recently passed health care law. According to Gene Ulm of Public Opinion Strategies, a firm working for Burns, 65% of the district's residents disapprove of the House speaker. 

Full Text 
JOHNSTOWN, Pa. -- In 36 years as a congressman, John Murtha made it his mission to funnel millions of dollars from Capitol Hill to this district of shuttered steel mills and struggling coal mines. Two months after his burial, the Washington money is still flowing to Murtha country -- this time for the contest to pick his successor. 
The veteran Democrat's death Feb. 8 of complications from gallbladder surgery has set the stage for a special election next month that both parties hope will be a harbinger for the fall congressional contests. It's the first special election in a competitive district since the health care law passed, and polls out this week show a dead heat between Democrat Mark Critz and Republican Tim Burns. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, held dueling Washington fundraisers this week for their candidates. By the time voters go to the polls May 18, Pennsylvania Republican Chairman Rob Gleason predicts the price tag for the three-month campaign in this southwestern Pennsylvania district, where the median family income is $50,000, will surpass $3 million. 
"This is very big," said Gleason, a businessman who lives in Johnstown. "I'm putting everything I can into it." 
In neighboring Fayette County, veteran Democratic Party Chairman Fred Lebder is giving a similar message to his troops. "We can do it," he said at a campaign headquarters opening in Uniontown on April 12. "But we have to work our butts off." 
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich is scheduled to stump for Burns today. Coming later: Sen. Scott Brown, the Massachusetts Republican whose surprise win in a special election -- for a seat that Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy occupied for nearly 47 years before his death -- is a model for the upset the Republican Party hopes to score here. Democrats are countering with a Friday fundraiser headlined by Vice President Biden. 
The discontent that polls and politicians are detecting nationwide is especially pronounced in the steel towns that saw tens of thousands of jobs vanish in the course of a generation. "There is a lot of anger out there," says Richard Bloomingdale, president-elect of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. "They lost their good, union-paying jobs and now they're working at Wal-Mart." 
Despite Murtha's long tenure, and the Democrats' better than 2-to-1 registration edge, there are lots of reasons for GOP optimism. 
In the 2008 presidential race, the district divided 49%-49%. Voters gave the Republican nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the edge by 873 votes. 
"They're not afraid to cross party lines," says Burns, the Republican nominee. 
Burns, 42, is a self-made millionaire who says he doesn't believe in man-made global warming -- a popular position in a district where there are concerns that climate change regulations will curtail the use of coal -- and wants to repeal the recently passed health care law. 
Critz, 48, served as Murtha's district director and is emphasizing his tie to the late congressman while distancing himself from national party policies. "I opposed the health care bill," Critz says in his latest TV ad. "And I'm pro-life and pro-gun. That's not liberal." 
Critz got into the race Feb. 22. Burns, meanwhile, spent the better part of a year campaigning in what was widely viewed as a long-shot race against Murtha. Now, he finds himself the national party's new champion. 
"This will be a referendum on the current agenda -- the Obama-Pelosi agenda," says Burns, who is making Pelosi a major issue in the race. "I can't wait to tell Nancy Pelosi to her face what I really think of her," the software entrepreneur told a luncheon of coal mine executives here, eliciting appreciative chuckles. 
There's a reason Burns is making an issue of the San Francisco Democrat. According to Gene Ulm of Public Opinion Strategies, a firm working for Burns, 65% of the district's residents disapprove of the House speaker. "No one likes her here," concedes Gloria Dillon, a Democratic state committeewoman. 
The irony is that Pelosi enjoyed an odd-couple friendship with Murtha. A former Marine who disagreed with Pelosi on abortion and gun control, Murtha nonetheless helped her become the first female speaker. She let him continue to amass the clout that enabled him to win more "earmarks" -- special, federally funded projects -- for his district than any other member of the House in 2008 and 2009, according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
Critz is banking on voters remembering that when they go to the polls. "Economic development and jobs are really the focus of my campaign," he says. 
Complicating the race: The special election to fill Murtha's seat will be held the same day as the Pennsylvania primary. That means it's possible a candidate could win the seat for now but lose the party contest to run for a full two-year term in November. 
Both Burns and Critz have primary competition. The most formidable candidate: Bill Russell, an Army veteran opposing Burns for the Republican nomination. Russell, 47, got more than 42% of the vote against Murtha last year and had as much money in the bank as of March 30 as Burns and Critz. 
"Our supporters are still there and very strong," he says. 
The deciding factor in the race: Voters such as mine foreman Ed Parks. A registered Democrat who says he voted for Murtha and Obama, Parks says he's not sure how he's going to vote, but he is sick of the bickering in Washington. 
"You watch the State of the Union Address, you could draw a line straight down the middle of the room," he said, referring to the partisan reaction to Obama's speech. "I'm mad at all of them."

Earth Day: Smile, don't shudder: Ignore doomsday environmentalists. Things aren't so bad. And if rich countries would worry about the right things, all the better.

Abstract 
In most of the First World, deforestation has turned to reforestation. [...] the percentage of malnutrition has been reduced, and ever-more people have access to clean water and sanitation. 

Full Text 
Given all the talk of impending catastrophe, this may come as a surprise, but as we approach the 40th anniversary of the first Earth Day, people who care about the environment actually have a lot to celebrate. Of course, that's not how the organizers of Earth Day 2010 see it. In their view (to quote a recent online call to arms), "The world is in greater peril than ever." But consider this: In virtually every developed country, the air is more breathable and the water is more drinkable than it was in 1970. In most of the First World, deforestation has turned to reforestation. Moreover, the percentage of malnutrition has been reduced, and ever-more people have access to clean water and sanitation. 
Apocalyptic predictions from concerned environmental activists are nothing new. Until about 10 years ago, I took it for granted that these predictions were sound. Like many of us, I believed that the world was in a terrible state that was only getting worse with each passing day. My thinking changed only when, as a university lecturer, I set out with my students to disprove what I regarded at the time as the far-fetched notion that global environmental conditions were actually improving. 
To our surprise, the data showed us that many key environmental measures were indeed getting better. We also found a disturbing gulf between the chief concerns of rich countries and the problems that actually do the most damage to the world. 
If anything, this gulf between perception and reality has gotten wider over the years. For example, one of the "core issues" that the organizers of this year's Earth Day say we should be worrying about is the use of fertilizers and pesticides. It may be unfashionable to point this out, but without the high-yield agricultural practices developed over the past 60 years, virtually all the forests of the world would have to have been cleared to make way for food production. And starvation would be much, much more prevalent. 
Climate change urgency? 
Of course, in the minds of Earth Day activists, no environmental challenge is more urgent than the need to drastically cut carbon emissions in order to stop global warming. But is climate change really the No. 1 problem we face? 
What about indoor air pollution, which happens to be the world's No. 1 environmental killer? In poor countries, 2.5 billion people rely on "biomass" -- wood, waste and dung -­to cook and keep themselves warm. This year, the resulting pollution will kill about 1.3 million of them, mainly women and children. Switching from biomass to fossil fuels would dramatically improve the lives of more than a third of the world's population. Unfortunately, you're not likely to hear any of this year's Earth Day speakers promoting greater use of fossil fuels in poor countries. 
I'm not saying we can blithely ignore global warming. Man-made climate change is real, and we do need to do something about it. But in a world in which most developing countries depend almost exclusively on fossil fuels to power their economies, it's both impractical and immoral to insist that the only solution is for everyone to drastically cut carbon emissions. This approach might make sense if we were able to offer developing countries practical, affordable alternatives to coal and oil. But we cannot -- and as long as we can't, all we're really doing when we call for massive carbon cuts is asking the world's poor people to continue living lives of misery and deprivation. 
Help the developing world first 
So what should we do? Well, to begin with, we might consider one of the fundamental lessons of the past 40 years of environmental concern. You cannot expect people to care about what the environment may be like 100 years from now if they are worrying about whether their children have enough to eat. With this in mind, we should focus on the many more immediate problems faced by the developing world today -- problems such as malnutrition, education, disease and clean drinking water. At the same time, we should take meaningful steps to ensure that the future of the developing world will be powered by green energy. As long as the electricity from sustainable sources such as solar panels costs us 10 times as much as electricity generated by coal-fired generators, no one but rich nations will go green (and then only if there are government subsidies). What we need to do is to promote the kind of technological breakthroughs necessary to make solar panels cheaper than fossil fuels. Once we have done that, no one will have to be ordered to give up coal and oil. 
Our goal should thus be twofold: first, to confront the most immediate problems facing the Third World; second, to provide developing countries with the energy technologies they need to create a green, prosperous world. Surprisingly, these goals seem to turn off many in the environmental movement. But while they will use Earth Day to writhe in collective shame at the damage that greedy, gas-guzzling Western consumers are delivering to the fragile planet, the rest of us should celebrate our environmental successes and chart out a reasonable path through the challenges that remain.

Full Text 
Bill McKibben lives near a burbling creek in the Green Mountains of Vermont. Yet even there, he sees a telltale sign of climate change -- a deep gash in the woods caused by a recent flood. 
McKibben, longtime environmentalist and author of more than a dozen books, first warned about global warming (then called the "greenhouse effect") in 1989 in The End of Nature, which he says was largely philosophical. 
In contrast, his new book, Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet (Henry Holt), is a dire, frightening call to action. It talks about the planet melting, drying, acidifying, flooding and burning in heretofore unseen ways. 
"The world hasn't ended, but the world as we know it has -- even if we don't quite know it yet. It's a different place. A different planet. It needs a new name." Since it's Earth-like, he says, let's call it "Eaarth." 
McKibben, 50, sees a slight chance we could still save the planet. 
"If we're very lucky and very committed," he writes, it may be possible in several decades to bring carbon dioxide levels, now nearly 390 parts per million, back to what climate scientist James Hansen says is the maximum safe level -- 350 parts per million. 
That's why McKibben and a handful of students at Middlebury College, where he's a scholar in residence, started the grass-roots group 350.org last year to raise awareness and press for political action. "We're not going to solve climate change one household at a time," he says. "What we need is a law, national and international, that puts a cap on carbon and raises its price." 
Such a bill, pushed by President Obama, is now pending in the U.S. Senate. McKibben says he understands why people don't want to believe in climate change: They're addicted to fossil fuels. To maintain that addiction, the oil and coal industries are spending a lot of money to spread "disinformation" about global warming, he says. 
What gives him optimism is young people's intrinsic understanding of the world's interconnectedness, fostered by Facebook and social networking. 
"The Internet is the one wild card," he says, "that may work in our favor in bringing international change."

Exelon CEO: Deal with emissions now: Climate issues won't go away, Rowe says

Abstract 
Yet Rowe says Exelon, the company created out of a merger a decade ago, will ultimately prevail because its nuclear energy is far cleaner than coal, which provides 56% of the USA's electricity. On climate change, "John's been the single most important figure in the utility industry," says energy expert Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy group. 

Full Text 
CHICAGO -- John Rowe has little to be down about. 
He's CEO of one of the nation's largest and most profitable utilities, Exelon, which runs the nation's largest fleet of nuclear power-generating plants. 
He's the industry's longest-serving CEO and is so dialed in that the Obama administration tapped him to lobby lawmakers on legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions. Rowe has amassed a personal fortune that has enabled him to give millions, including donations to an inner-city school here that bears his name and educates students that he references by name. 
But ask Rowe whether Congress will pass legislation to cut carbon emissions of big polluters, such as utilities, and he says, "I'm very depressed." 
The legislation, in limbo while Congress tackles health care and financial overhauls, has been "sandbagged by partisan rancor," Rowe says. He gives it a much slimmer chance of 
passing this year than he had thought. 

Yet Rowe says Exelon, the company created out of a merger a decade ago, will ultimately prevail because its nuclear energy is far cleaner than coal, which provides 56% of the 

USA's electricity. 
The carbon legislation will come back, Rowe says, because climate change concerns won't end. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to regulate carbon 
emissions of power plants and others. 

Either way, Rowe says, costs to run coal plants go up. That drives energy prices higher, benefiting Exelon, since 92% of its power comes from low carbon-emitting nuclear plants that won't suffer the same higher costs as coal plants. 
"Exelon wins sooner or later," Rowe says. "It may just be after I retire," at the end of 2012. 
Rowe, 64, looks the part of the industry statesman that colleagues say he's become. His gray hair is close clipped. He dresses in a suit and tie with French cuffs. He keeps an 
Egyptian coffin, "not quite museum quality," he says, in his office, which is lined with hundreds of books, many historical. 

A History of Wales runs 1,700 pages. Has he read it? "I'm Welsh," he answers. 

Rowe's father wanted one of his three sons to assume his Wisconsin farm. But Rowe was clumsy and asthmatic as a child; his parents knew he was college bound, in part, 
because he was so bad at farm work, Rowe says. 
Rowe's mother, a former teacher, checked out library books. Rowe read them all. He still reads two or three at a time. Rowe plucks a favorite from his office shelf, the Pulitzer 

Prize-winning Banks and Politics in America, written by Bray Hammond a half-century ago. Last year, Rowe gave a copy to a legislator on the House Committee on Financial 
Services. "I doubt they ever read it," he grumbles. 
Such subtle power of suggestion has served Rowe well in the circles in which he travels in the energy sector and on Capitol Hill, colleagues say. 

Speaking out, finding listeners 
At times, Rowe looks so disengaged in meetings that "you wonder if he's listening," says Jason Grumet, an energy adviser to the Obama campaign and president of the 
Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. "He'll sit back and not say anything for 45 minutes ... but when he does, everyone leans on their elbows to hear what he has 
to say," Grumet says. 

Rowe has been speaking a lot lately on carbon legislation. 

Twice in the past year, he testified on it before congressional committees. In September, Exelon created a stir by saying it would leave the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because 
of what Rowe called the group's "stridency against carbon legislation." 
On climate change, "John's been the single most important figure in the utility industry," says energy expert Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy 

group. "He's figured out that business interests and environmental issues are inseparable." 

In 2008, Exelon said it would reduce, offset or displace its entire carbon footprint by 2020. So far, it's cut emissions equal to those from more than a million cars, it says. 
"Rowe isn't a Johnny-come-lately to the climate debate," says Howard Learner, executive director of the advocacy Environmental Law & Policy Center. But neither is Rowe an activist CEO, Learner says. "John is focused on the green, namely, profitability for shareholders, as well as on the green for the environment," Learner says. Careful with money On carbon emissions, Rowe fixates on the need to fix the problem now or pay more later. "The longer we put it off, the more expensive it gets," Rowe says. While some say the 
U.S. needs to expand its nuclear fleet to substantially cut carbon emissions, Rowe says new nuclear plants are currently too expensive to build to compete with cheap natural gas. Instead, Exelon is adding capacity to existing plants. 
"My dad felt about cows the way I feel about nuclear plants," Rowe says. "They're a business, not a passion." 
Rowe got a strong parental message about money, too: Be careful. He picked mustard weeds from fields for pennies a weed. "You could buy a new baseball glove ... but you'd 
better have put money in the bank, too," Rowe says. 

Rowe's taken the same approach to Exelon's finances. Last year, he abandoned a $7.5 billion bid to buy NRG Energy, to create the nation's largest power-generation company, 

after a sweetened bid failed. On acquisitions, he compares Exelon to hyenas. "We're constantly looking for something dead in the plains." 
Exelon was made by the merger of Unicom, the owner of the electric company serving Chicago, and Philadelphia-based Peco Energy. As CEO of Unicom, Rowe sold the 
company's coal plants and bet its future on nuclear, even though the fleet was a "disgrace," at the time, Rowe says. 

In 2008, Exelon's 17 nuclear reactors, located in Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, ran at 93.9% capacity, it says, vs. 91.5% for the industry average. Hugh Wynne, analyst 
for Bernstein Research, says Exelon is one of the industry's most profitable players. "They're just the best nuclear operators in the business," Wynne says.

Abstract 
Whether it's the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the fall of Saigon in 1975 or the economic challenge from Japan in the 1980s, "there's this persistent conviction that our best days are behind us," says George Friedman, founder of STRATFOR, a private intelligence service. Historians chalk it up to the "creative destruction" that accompanies major technological innovation, be it steam and coal in the early 19th century or digital information in the 21st. 

Full Text 
A new decade finds Americans in an uncomfortable and yet familiar position: running scared. 
Almost three-fourths of them, according to a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, don't like the way things are going in the country. Given economic deprivation and political division, plus 
war, terrorism and a warming world, who would? 
But during the next 10 years, our fright may be our salvation. Americans often suspect they face the worst of times and, as a result, try harder to make the best of them. 
Whether it's the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the fall of Saigon in 1975 or the economic challenge from Japan in the 1980s, "there's this persistent conviction that our best days 

are behind us," says George Friedman, founder of STRATFOR, a private intelligence service. "We always think that the U.S. is finished." 

Yet Americans' assumption that they're at the brink is what saves them from going over it. Instead of underestimating challenges, we overreact. In a competitive world, 
Friedman says, "it's a key to our success." 
You can hear echoes of that in the debate over the national debt. 
David Walker, former head of the Government Accountability Office, says we'll be a poorer nation in 2020 unless we quickly reduce borrowing for federal spending: "We've 

kicked the can down the road as far as we can. We are at the abyss." 

Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, however, sees a national economy in 2020 "not hugely different than today. ... It's not a horror story. We're 
not on the brink of collapse." 
If history's a guide, we'll hope Baker is right, and act as if Walker is. 
That tension between optimism and pessimism is particularly relevant as the future comes faster than ever. "In the next 10 years we're going to see more changes than in the 

last 20," says Los Angeles marketing consultant Anthony Mora. 

Historians chalk it up to the "creative destruction" that accompanies major technological innovation, be it steam and coal in the early 19th century or digital information in the 
21st. 
"Boom industries reshape not just our economy, but our society," says Michael Stoff, co-author of the college U.S. history textbook Nation of Nations. "That's what's happening 

now." 
What happens next? USA TODAY reporters and specialists talked to experts, stretched their imaginations and came up with ideas about what 2020 might look like: 
Demographics 
*Population follows immigration, and immigration follows the money. The U.S. population could grow from 308 million to as much as 350 million if times are good and to as little 

as 334 million if they aren't, according to the Census Bureau. 

*Immigration creates a generation gap. The split: between aging, mostly white Baby Boomers and younger, more racially diverse "Millennials," the oldest of whom now are in 
their 20s. Issues such as health care and Social Security will produce "a huge cleavage," says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. 
*We'll be older, more diverse, less sprawling. About 16% of Americans will be 65 and older, up from fewer than 13%. Non-Hispanic whites will shrink from 65% to 60% of the 

population. And far-flung suburban-style growth, now halted by the recession, may never fully return because of energy costs, environmental concerns and smaller households. 
World affairs 
*The United States stays No. 1. Islamist militants pose no "existential" threat to the USA, and China's rise "is vastly exaggerated" given its vast, impoverished peasantry and 

anemic Navy, Friedman says. America remains the top economic and military power because no nation is close to unseating it. 

*Continued military deployment. Thomas Donnelly of the American Enterprise sees a decade of U.S. military involvement abroad, particularly in the region from Yemen to Pakistan. "We'll likely have forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in 10 years, but hopefully under quite different circumstances than today. Hopefully, it will evolve into a more normal military partnership." But given the region's instability, he adds, "You can't say which place is going to explode." 
Economics 
*Weak job growth. Many U.S. jobs will continue to move overseas or be replaced by automation. The government estimates that an additional 1.2 million manufacturing jobs will vanish by 2018, on top of the 2.1 million factory jobs lost since the recession started in December 2007. Former Labor secretary Robert Reich says that even when the economy recovers, most of the jobs created won't be very good ones. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), by comparison, is upbeat. The agency expects the economy to generate 15.3 million jobs from 2008 to 2018. And it forecasts 5.1% unemployment in 2018. 
*Weak consumer spending. Consumers, who account for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, are exhausted after the binge of the past decade fueled by credit cards and home equity loans. The BLS expects consumer spending to grow 2.5% a year from 2008 to 2018, down from 3% in the previous decade. 
*Weak economic growth. Daniel Stelter of Boston Consulting Group sees an economy in a bind: Old industries, such as autos and steel, are declining, and new ones, such as solar energy and biotechnology, won't soon generate lots of jobs. 
Education 
*Technology that "unbundles" schools. "Most high school kids are going to be doing most of their learning online," says Tom Vander Ark, former executive director of education for the Gates Foundation, who says schools "are to a much greater extent going to be a blend of online and on-site." That could lead to an "unbundling" of education from one centralized, highly regulated source, such as a public school or single textbook. Schools will narrow their missions as students get more content from libraries, museums or other specialized sources, says Connie Yowell of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. 
*Less "tyranny of localism." Technology will reduce the power of locally elected, highly political school boards -- what Ted Mitchell, president of the California Board of Education, calls "the tyranny of localism." A series of internationally benchmarked common standards could control curricula, textbook content and the training, certification, hiring and evaluation of teachers. Then, Mitchell says, local boards could shift "from regulating and controlling input to monitoring outcome." 
*More sophisticated standardized tests. Testing and assessment systems, beefed up following the passage of the No Child Left Behind law in 2002, will become even more important, says Tom Loveless of the Brookings Institution: "Accountability isn't going to stop. Testing is going to get more sophisticated." States are developing systems that can potentially trace a student's individual skills and knowledge -- or lack thereof -- back to a single teacher. Parents might someday be able to compare teachers head-to-head, much as they now compare schools. 
Health and medicine 
*Cancer cell genomics. With the human genome sequenced, scientists turn to the genomics of cancer cells, trying to identify the genetic changes that turn a cell cancerous. "In the next two or three years we are going to completely change the landscape of our understanding of cancer," says Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads the National Institutes of Health. Researchers could develop treatments to block genetic changes in the evolution of a cancer cell. "We are finally poised to win that war on cancer." 
*Individual genome sequencing. Although the genomes of any two people are 99% alike, the differences affect their risk of disease and response to drugs. Collins says that in five years, a personal genome sequence will cost less than a colonoscopy. As more is learned about the role of inherited genes in diseases such as diabetes, Collins says, the ability to predict risk will increase. 
*Alzheimer's as public health enemy No. 1. Better treatment of diseases such as cancer and heart disease means more people will live long enough to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, says William Thies of the Alzheimer's Association. About 5.3 million Americans have the disease, and that number is expected to increase by half a million annually. By 2020, Thies says, Alzheimer's will be the nation's "primary public health problem." 
Science and technology 
*Space exploration partnerships. When the space shuttle retires in 2011, human space exploration faces a crossroads. Foreign partners increasingly look attractive to NASA, which will consider joint Jupiter robotic exploration with Europe. 
*Carbon "sequestration." With fossil fuels still likely to provide 78% of the world's power in 2035 (compared with more than 80% today), could technology make it feasible to dispose of carbon dioxide from power plants by burying it in underground gas fields? The International Energy Agency warns that without such technology, the world faces a dangerous level of global warming -- an average increase in global surface temperatures of at least 8 degrees in this century, leading to rising seas, drought and damaged farmlands. 
Air travel 
*Chronic delays ... again. The year 2020 could end up feeling like 2000, when delays plagued aviation. Delays already are common at the three major New York airports and often cascade across the nation. Looking ahead, there are few advanced plans for new runways or major airports and little hope for quick implementation of the government's "next generation" air-traffic control system. 
*More non-stop destinations. New long-range aircraft -- notably the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 XWB -- will open routes that technically were impossible or commercially unprofitable. Airlines will fly to more medium-size overseas cities such as Osaka or Prague and make more overseas flights from U.S. hubs previously too small to support more than a few, such as Denver, Phoenix, Cleveland and Memphis. 
*Space tourism. Outer space could join the list of destinations. Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic promises to start commercial "suborbital" flights as soon as this year from the recently christened Spaceport America in New Mexico. By 2020, travelers with a few hundred thousand dollars to spare probably will be able to book a real flight to outer space. 
*The return of the turboprop. Airlines raced to replace unpopular turboprops with regional jets 10 years ago. But the regional jets never made the money some airlines expected, and their small storage bins and low headroom alienated many travelers. A new generation of advanced turboprop models -- Bombardier's Q-400 series, for example -- offer a quieter, smoother ride than their predecessors. And their ability to land on shorter runways gives airlines flexibility at congested airports. 
Driving 
*More of the same. What we're driving tomorrow probably will look much like what we're driving today. "It's going to have four wheels, and it's going to have headlights, and it's going to drive down the road," says Matt Novak, editor of the websitePaleofuture.com, which looks at past predictions of the future. 
*Better gas mileage. New fuel-efficiency rules phase in with 2012 models. By the 2016 model year, the industry would have to average of 35.5 miles per gallon. The fuel economy rules are estimated to add an average of $1,100 to the price of a car but could save $3,000 on fuel over the vehicle's life. 
*Alternative fuels. If customers are willing to buy electric-powered cars -- the Chevrolet Volt debuts at the end of 2010 -- the market share by 2020 could explode by a factor of 
100. But that still would amount to just 1% of all new domestic vehicle sales. Hybrids and various plug-ins should account for one of every eight new vehicles sold in 2020 in the USA, up from one of 35 now, according to J.D. Power and Associates. 
Personal technology *Computers that anticipate our needs. An example from Jonathan Cluts of Microsoft: Instead of checking an onscreen TV guide, you'll receive programming suggestions based on your viewing habits and activities (a vacation to New Zealand you booked online) or interests (the French course for which you ordered a textbook). 
*Housework by robots. A robotic vacuum cleaner (such as iRobot's Roomba, a basic model of which costs as little as $130 ) will "talk" to other single-purpose robots in the house. When one is done with its chores -- emptying the dishwasher, sorting the socks -- word will pass to a second machine. Eventually, Cluts says, "You won't have a robot in your house. You'll have lots of robots." 
*Shape-shifting personal computers. Justin Rattner, Intel's chief technology officer, says millions of tiny micro-robots could assemble themselves in different shapes and colors. 
A handheld computer might fold into your pocket, reassemble itself as a mobile phone or become large and flat with a keyboard and display screen. 
*Brain chip implants. You might be able to control TVs, computers and phones just by thinking of something -- provided you've had a wireless chip sensor implanted in your 
brain. You probably won't be able to write a complex e-mail just by thinking it, but you might be able to control a mouse. 

Sports 

*No stopping performance-enhancers. Drug tests won't stop athletes from pursuing short cuts to excellence; we may see the day when a linebacker bench presses the team bus 
-- while Tweeting. 
*The four-quarter commercial. The search for more revenue streams could lead to the Hewlett-Packard Packers facing the Toyota Titans in the Microsoft Super Bowl. 
*We're not playing in Kansas anymore. World Cup soccer heads to South Africa in 2010, the Summer Olympics to Brazil in 2016. Around-the-world road trips could become the 

norm if the NFL and NBA go global. 
Entertainment 
*We'll view films in many ways -- on TVs, computers, e-tablets, even smart phones. 
*... But still go to the movies. John Wildman of the American Film Institute compares theaters with restaurants: "Even though people can prepare and eat good food in their 

own homes, they still go out." 

*Plusher theaters. Box-office tracker Robert Bucksbaum says theater owners will "spend whatever it takes to pull moviegoers from their couches." That means pristine digital images and sound; 3D; reserved seats; better food and drinks; and maybe even a speaker to introduce the movie. *Motion-controlled video games. Playing games with body movements, pioneered by the Nintendo Wii, will become standard. Players will control their on-screen avatar by 
moving hands, arms and legs. The multibuttoned video game controller? A thing of the past. 
*Healthier video games. Players of games that provide exercise will get lower health insurance premiums. Older Americans "who do Wii are fitter and move around more. So 

concerned family members (and) insurers are starting to say, 'How can I get Grandma and Granddad ... more involved?' " says Richard Doherty, director of the Envisioneering Group consulting and research firm. *TV and computer, all in one. Many household PCs and TVs will merge into a single device, providing seamless online access to movies and shows and a big, high-definition 
screen on which to watch them. 
*American Idol, 2020. Despite its detractors, reality TV -- inexpensively produced and hugely popular -- is here to stay ... even if Simon Cowell isn't a part of it.

Farmers raise plants as part of energy initiative though region still runs on coal 
ORDOS, China -- He has never heard of global warming or Copenhagen, where leaders from 193 countries gathered for a major climate change summit last weekend. 
But Ulandalai, 43, a farmer in one of China's most isolated desert regions, says he's doing his part to help the environment anyway. 
As part of a clean energy initiative partly sponsored by the Chinese government, Ulandalai, who uses just one name, planted sand willows three years ago on land where he 

used to graze sheep. 
There are several benefits to the switch, he says. 
First, the large shrub-like plants help hold down the soil, which Ulandalai and other locals say has reduced the intensity of sandstorms and made the area more hospitable to 

wildlife. 
Second, the sand willows can be harvested and burned to generate electricity, a process that produces fewer greenhouse gases than other energy sources such as coal. 
A nearby power plant built to burn the willow has paid Ulandalai $2,600 annually to plant and manage the crop, and he could receive double that amount when the first batch of 

sand willows is harvested next month. 
That has led to the third and final benefit: Compared with some of his neighbors, especially those who once criticized his decision, Ulandalai is getting rich. 
"They said, 'We Mongolians rely on our sheep and other animals. How can you live without them?' " Ulandalai recalls. "Now my neighbors want to plant sand willows, too." 
Coal remains king 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao told world leaders in Copenhagen that China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is moving more quickly than any other nation to 

adopt new and renewable energy sources. 

The project in Inner Mongolia shows how the Chinese government and private investors work together on clean energy initiatives. It also illustrates some of the sector's 
shortcomings. 
Despite all the "green" efforts, coal remains king in Ordos. The city is home to Shenhua, the world's largest coal company. 
The heavily polluting but cheap energy that coal provides and the ready availability of other natural resources nearby have helped make Ordos one of China's most prosperous 

cities. 
It has a per capita gross domestic product of almost $14,000 -- more than triple the $4,000 national average, the city government says. 
The Maowusu biomass thermal power plant, where Ulandalai sells his sand willows, needs substantial government subsidies to get by. The power plant says that for every 4 

cents it costs to generate electricity there, it receives 5 cents in subsidies so it can compete with the lower cost of coal-fired power. 

Li Jinglu, a former real estate mogul who has invested $51 million in the power plant, sees enough environmental benefits to make it worthwhile. He says he hopes to turn a 
profit within two years and eventually build and inspire 2,000 similar plants across the Chinese desert. 
"We can not only fight desertification, but produce clean energy to replace coal-produced power," says Li, 54. 
His plant has contracted 1,000 local farmers to grow sand willows and 150 full-time workers at the site. "We really can turn a disaster into a blessing," he says. 
'Next revolution' 

The Maowusu project "represents what's happening in China right now" with clean energy efforts, says Tim Clissold, CEO of Peony Capital, which manages a fund aimed at 
reducing China's greenhouse gas emissions. 
China says it spends about $9 billion a month on clean energy development. 
The government plans to make renewable energy account for 15% of its fuel by 2020. 
"The Chinese want to own the technology for this next revolution in new technology -- clean energy," Clissold says. "When the oil runs out, China will be in a strong position." 

The Ordos area is also home to wind and solar projects. 
Arizona-based First Solar recently signed a deal to build the world's largest solar farm here. When it's completed in 2019, it will be roughly the size of Manhattan and produce 
enough electricity for 3 million homes, the company says. 

Clissold says clean energy projects will become more viable once richer countries agree to provide more financing -- a goal the Copenhagen summit fell short of reaching, he 
says. 
Ulandalai is among those who see a prosperous future in green energy. 
"We know we can earn money from controlling the desert," he says.

The future of Silicon Valley looks straight into the sun: Much of Valley's energy is going into developing clean, green solar power

SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- MiaSole, a solar panel start-up, sits near the heart of Silicon Valley -- surrounded by blocks speckled with empty buildings that used to house chip, software and other companies. 
The greater Silicon Valley has lost 50,000 jobs in the past year, and its unemployment rate, almost 12%, is on par with the state, a rarity given Silicon Valley's highly trained workforce. 
But at MiaSole, there are 300 employees, up from 150 a year ago. Every employee, including the janitor, has stock options they hope will someday soar. CEO Joseph Laia faces the quintessential Silicon Valley conundrum: what to do with employees who work all night as MiaSole pushes to commercialize a cheaper solar-panel technology. He's considering a "cot room" for catnaps. 
MiaSole is just one example of the growth of green, or so-called clean-energy, technology in Silicon Valley, a place so filled with solar companies that kingpin venture capitalist John Doerr says it could be renamed "Solar Valley" in a decade. 
Traditionally, Silicon Valley has spun on the riches created by successive waves of innovation, from chips to computers to software to biotechnology and the Internet. Now, given concerns over global warming and, more recently, the push by the Obama administration to rev up the nation's clean-energy competitiveness, Silicon Valley is looking more for clean tech -- from solar power to electric cars and smart grids -- to be its next big thing. 
Clean tech "is the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century," says Doerr, who was an early investor in Netscape, Amazon and Google. Now, almost all of Doerr's new ventures are in clean tech, he says. 
In September, Doerr's former partner, Vinod Khosla, who co-founded Sun Microsystems, announced a $1.1 billion fund for clean-tech ventures, marking the largest pot of venture funds for the sector in two years. 
And when Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu in October announced the first federal grants for high-risk clean-tech ventures, he did it from Google's headquarters. 
"We're seeing acceleration of the Valley's focus on clean tech," says Alan Salzman, CEO of the venture capital firm VantagePoint Venture Partners. "The areas of innovation now and for 20 years are in clean tech." 
Familiar names in clean tech 
Clean tech is far from new for Silicon Valley. 
So many solar companies have been started in Silicon Valley in the past seven years that a shakeout is inevitable, says Rex Northen, executive director of the Cleantech Open, a business competition. 
But if clean tech was the new kid on the block five years ago, "It's now gone core," says Julie Blunden, vice president of solar-panel maker SunPower. Founded in 1985, it was spun off last year from Cypress Semiconductor. 
Google was among the first Silicon Valley heavies to make energy part of its culture. Two years ago, it created a group to research ways to make electricity from renewable energy as cheap as from coal -- causing some Wall Street research analysts to opine that Google was losing focus. 
Since then, Google has invested $45 million in a handful of clean-tech firms and other projects concentrating on such things as solar, wind, geothermal and electric vehicles. Google has nine engineers devoted to renewable technologies. It expects that number to double within a year, says Bill Weihl, Google's energy czar. 
Google also recently launched PowerMeter, its online tool to enable consumers to watch their home energy use. 
Other big-name Silicon Valley firms are also making moves in energy. In May, Cisco Systems unveiled its goal to provide the underlying technology for smart grids -- which aim to move electricity more efficiently than do today's grids -- just as Cisco started providing the plumbing for the Internet years ago. 
The payoff? A big chunk of what Cisco estimates could be a $20 billion annual smart-grid market within five years. Cisco started exploring the possibilities two years ago. Now, "It's definitely one of our big bets," says Cisco's smart grid guru Laura Ipsen. 
Software makers are getting a piece of the action, too. Phil Bernstein, vice president of Autodesk -- a leading maker of design, engineering and entertainment software -- says the "vast majority of attention" it now gets from clients is for tools that help make buildings more energy efficient. 
Applied Materials, the world's biggest maker of chipmaking equipment, is a prime example when it comes to exploiting the new market. It counts solar as its fastest-growing new business. In fiscal 2009, Applied's sales to solar-panel-making companies accounted for 20% of its $5 billion in revenue. In 2006, when Applied started in the sector, "A lot of people were in disbelief that we could be successful," CEO Michael Splinter says. Now, at any business dinner, not five minutes passes before someone asks: "How's your solar business going?" he says. 
A $6 trillion opportunity 
If clean tech emerges as the Silicon Valley's next big thing, it may not look much like the last. 
The founders of Netscape and Google were in their 20s. But clean tech "will be led by old dogs with experience," Northen says. "It won't be some kid working in a dorm room who'll hit it big." 
That's because many energy ventures pose high research hurdles, require big amounts of money, manufacturing expertise and people who know how to navigate a regulated industry. 
Google took about $25 million in investment before it went public, says Doerr, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Bloom Energy, which Kleiner Perkins invested in seven years ago, has taken $250 million. Doerr speculates that Bloom is still nine years from a successful initial public offering. 
Bloom, which aims to make fuel-cell systems to produce cheaper, clean energy from a variety of fuels, is headed by KR Sridhar, 49. Before Bloom, he led a team developing technologies to sustain life on Mars for NASA. 
At solar-panel maker MiaSole, the top seven executives have 120 years of combined experience in the chip and disk-drive industries, including hard-core manufacturing, says CEO Laia, 51, a former semiconductor chip executive. 
Instead of rooms packed with software engineers hacking at computer code, MiaSole's operations include a factory filled with robotic machines, a handful of assembly-line workers, and "Danger" high-voltage signs. Solar-panel production begins with rolls of thin steel. 
MiaSole has struggled. The company, founded in 2003, has gone through one CEO, Dave Pearce, who reportedly predicted that MiaSole would have $100 million in sales in 2007. Instead, it was forced to lay people off that year. It just shipped its first panels to customers in October. 
"This is hard," Laia says. "A lot of people underestimated just how much it takes to build a manufacturing company." Two years ago, MiaSole took the sign off its door and "focused on what it takes to make it work," Laia says. 
The energy business presents one thing that has long motivated Silicon Valley's talent: problems that, if cracked, can present huge profits as well as social benefits. While the Internet economy is worth about $1 trillion, energy presents a $6 trillion nut, Doerr says. 
"The early leaders in this market will make a ton of money," says Shai Agassi, 41. Agassi, a former top executive at software giant SAP, launched Better Place in Silicon Valley in 2007. 
Agassi envisions a world in which gasoline-powered cars are replaced by electric cars, and it supplies charging stations for drivers to recharge or swap batteries and software to enable drivers to manage their travel. Renault-Nissan has agreed to make electric cars that work with Better Place's system. Israel and Denmark will be Better Place's first fully deployed markets in 2011, it says. 
While still at SAP and before launching Better Place, Agassi laid out his vision to several people, including Israeli President Shimon Peres. Peres encouraged him to follow through on it. 
Agassi responded that his goal was to be the next CEO at SAP. Peres, Agassi recalls, asked him why he wanted to do that when his vision for electric cars could save the planet. 
"I didn't have a good answer," he says.

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- A solid majority of Americans support the idea of a global treaty that would require the United States to reduce significantly greenhouse gas emissions, a USA 
TODAY/Gallup Poll finds, although many also express concern about the potential impact on the economy. 
The results provide some encouragement for President Obama, who attends the United Nations conference on climate change in Copenhagen on Friday. By 55%-38%, those 
surveyed endorse a binding accord to limit the gases tied to global warming. 

By a lopsided 7-1, however, Americans say the administration should put a higher priority on improving the economy than reducing global warming. And they are split on the 

likely economic impact of enacting new environmental and energy laws to address climate change: 42% say they will hurt the economy; 36% say they will help. 
"There's a lot of public support for various climate policy approaches that diminishes as you begin to put a specific dollar figure with it," says Barry Rabe, a University of 
Michigan political scientist who studies public opinion on the environment. He says the findings show many Americans open to persuasion. 

For instance, two in 10 say new environmental laws "definitely" will hurt the economy; one in 10 say they "definitely" will help. Two thirds are somewhere in the middle, less 
certain of the economic effect or saying it would have no impact at all. 
Young people, those 18 to 29 years old, are by far the most supportive of a treaty, backing the idea by 66%-26%. Those over 65 are opposed by 49%-42%. 

There also are geographic differences. Support is highest in the East, lowest in the South. 
Battles between Democrats representing environment-conscious coastal areas and those from Rust Belt states that depend on coal have complicated White House efforts to 
push an energy bill through Congress. The House passed a measure in June, but it is stalled in the Senate. 

Americans are divided about where to strike the balance between the economy and the environment: 46% say they worry more that the United States will take actions against 
global warming that cripple the U.S. economy. An additional 38% worry more that the country will not take action against global warming because of economic concerns. 
The poll of 1,025 adults taken Friday-Sunday has an error margin of +/-4 percentage points. 

Barack Obama started the year with a job-approval rating of 64%-25% -- a net positive standing by a formidable 39 percentage points. 
Now, he closes the year with a rating of 49%-46%. That net positive rating of three points is his narrowest so far. The approval rating matches his record low in early October 
and the disapproval rating equals his record high later that month. 

That is the worst standing in Gallup for any modern elected president at the end of his first year, though it's close to Ronald Reagan's 49%-41% rating in December 1981 -- also a time of economic woe. 
And that Nobel Peace Prize? 
Americans apparently weren't swayed by the address Obama delivered in Oslo last week when he picked up the award. By 61%-35%, those surveyed say he didn't deserve it, 
almost precisely the same as when the prize was announced in October.

Okla. senator plans to rain on climate talks: Emissions bill is dead, Inhofe says, and he wants nations to know it

Abstract 
Even Republicans who say global warming may be a problem, including Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., say a cap on carbon emissions would damage the U.S. economy by pushing up energy prices. 

Full Text 
COPENHAGEN -- The final week of the United Nations climate change summit boils down to a battle between President Obama and the self-described "skunk at the picnic." 
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who has called global warming a "hoax," plans to travel this week to Copenhagen. He'll stay just long enough -- as few as three hours, he says -- to tell heads of state that the Senate will not pass an energy bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
"We know (the bill) is never going to go to a vote," Inhofe said in a recent interview. "It's dead. It's gone ... I'm not going to allow them to think America is going to do something it's not." 
Delegates from other countries say that without Congress' support, Obama won't be able to keep whatever promises he makes when he arrives here Friday to try to seal a deal on capping emissions. Without the full cooperation of the world's second-biggest emitter behind China, any broad agreement to address global warming by the 192 nations gathered in Copenhagen will simply fall apart, they say. 
"Unless the U.S. has the political will to make the necessary sacrifices, none of this will work," said Sudanese diplomat Lumumba Di-Aping, the lead representative for more than 130 developing nations at the summit. 
Obama has proposed cutting greenhouse gas emissions by about 17% by 2020, compared with levels in 2005. He says a firm cap on carbon dioxide produced by U.S. industry, as mandated by a House bill passed in June, will help slow global warming and provide an incentive for companies to invest in cleaner energy. The Senate is to debate an energy bill early next year. 
"There are many (U.S.) companies and investors ... waiting for Congress to act, waiting for some certainty before they make these investments," Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said. He said Chinese companies were moving ahead with "green" technology: "If we don't watch out ... they'll end up with all those jobs." 
Even Republicans who say global warming may be a problem, including Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., say a cap on carbon emissions would damage the U.S. economy by pushing up energy prices. Carbon emitters such as power plants and factories would have to pay for permits to keep burning coal and oil at the same levels. The cost, Republicans say, would be passed on to consumers in higher energy bills. 
The U.S. debate is one of many issues unresolved as the summit enters its second week. 
"I think there needs to be more movement from everyone, more imagination, and I think we will all be striving for that," British Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. 
Developing nations and China are pushing for the United States to make even more ambitious cuts to emissions, while refusing to bow to U.S. demands for a transparent system ensuring they meet their own targets. 
China wants wealthier countries to set aside more funds for poorer nations to deal with the consequences of global warming. 
The deadlock over basic issues, as well as the scarcity of money available during the global recession, has caused some to downgrade expectations for the summit. Organizers have abandoned their goal of signing a binding global treaty in Copenhagen. 
"It's important to keep the issue alive, to use (Copenhagen) as kind of a placeholder ... rather than have the issue slip off the table," said Stephen Porter, a lawyer with the Center for International Environmental Law, which works with foreign lawyers to strengthen environmental laws. 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei cautioned countries against trying to save face at the summit by agreeing on goals far into the future -- such as in 2050. 
"If you cannot deliver on the short term or medium term, you cannot talk about the long term," the minister said Friday. By 2050, he said, "most of us will not be here anymore."

Abstract 
To move forward, developed countries must first breathe in hard and make commitments to offer generous financial support for developing countries and least developed countries to help them finance technology changes and adapt to the impacts of global warming. 

Full Text 
The Jakarta (Indonesia) Post, in an editorial: "The (United Nations Climate Change) conference brings together representatives of more than 180 countries. ... The outcome of the climate change summit meeting will determine the follow-up agreement to the Kyoto protocol. ... To move forward, developed countries must first breathe in hard and make commitments to offer generous financial support for developing countries and least developed countries to help them finance technology changes and adapt to the impacts of global warming. Only then, can they expect developing countries, especially the big ones like China, India and Brazil, to commit themselves to major climate mitigation efforts by voluntarily reducing their greenhouse gas emissions." 
The (Taiwan) China Post, in an editorial: "It is in China's national interest to succeed, judging from the serious environmental degradation its breakneck economic development has caused in the past three decades. ... In recent years, 'saving energy and cutting emissions' has become a catchphrase in China, but the slogan is yet to be translated into action. ... It is reasonable to expect that Copenhagen would get world leaders to recognize the importance of addressing climate change. Hopefully, they can make some sort of non-binding commitments to reduce emissions, as many have already pledged. " 
The Australian, in an editorial: "There is no possibility such sources (alternative energy) will completely replace existing, economically efficient power supplies in the foreseeable future. ... For all the talk about the evils of uranium, gas and coal exports, our prosperity depends on the income they produce, and we have a moral obligation to export our resources to people who need them. ... Whatever comes out of Copenhagen, it is pointless to argue Australia should commit to cutting its energy exports and must radically reduce its own domestic energy use. While such solutions appeal to activists ... Australians will not cut their energy use to Depression levels when they know they produce barely 1.5% of the world's greenhouse gas." 
Bjorn Lomborg, director of Copenhagen Consensus Center, in The (Abu Dhabi, UAE) National: "Providing Vitamin A and zinc to 80% of the 140 million or so undernourished children in the world would require a commitment of just $60 million annually. For $286 million, we could get iron and iodine to more than 2.5 billion people. The choice is stark: For a few hundred million dollars, we could help almost half of humanity now. Compare this with the investments to tackle climate change -- $40 trillion annually by the end of the century (according to Copenhagen Consensus Center) -- which would save a hundred times fewer starving people." 
The (Tokyo) Japan Times, in an editorial: "The reluctance of both sides to take serious action has grown in the last year as the global economic crisis has taken its bite. No government is going to accept a protocol that increases its costs and undermines its economic prospects. ... No wonder then that no one expects the Copenhagen conclave to reach a complete agreement. ... The trick ... is to recognize that greener growth is not just a necessity, but an opportunity. ... Indeed, numerous studies show that transition itself to this kind of economy can create jobs. Adopting this mind-set -- as well as accepting some responsibility for the future of the planet -- is key to the eventual success of any deal."

Pollution summit faces tough hurdles: Experts ask how a deal would be enforced

Abstract 
In a study last year, Weiss and colleagues took air samples and found that levels of nitrogen trifluoride, an industrial gas 17,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide as an atmospheric warming agent, were four times above what industry estimates had suggested. 

Full Text 
COPENHAGEN -- Ray Weiss looks at the chanting protesters, harried delegates and the 20,000 other people gathered here for a global warming summit and wonders: What's 
the fuss all about? 
Weiss, a geochemist who studies atmospheric pollution at San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, says the numbers at the core of the debate in Copenhagen are 
flawed. 

He says the cuts that countries, including the USA, are proposing in greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to measure and highly susceptible to manipulation by government 

officials and companies. 
"I don't see the point in doing all this if the numbers are so far off," Weiss said Thursday. "When you hear politicians tell you that they can measure these things, just because 
they passed a deal in Copenhagen, I think you should take that with a few grains of salt." 

Most of the summit's attention has focused on how much countries will commit to cutting emissions of gases that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change says are causing Earth to warm. Yet some scientists, legal experts and delegates say the hardest part of any deal in Copenhagen will be measuring and enforcing what 
the politicians decide. 

Those two issues are "the iceberg on which the entire conference could founder," says Peter Goldmark, a program director for the Environmental Defense Fund, which wants a 

limit on the use of carbon-based sources of energy such as coal and oil. 
The Obama administration has proposed a 17% cut in greenhouse gas emissions (largely produced by industrial activity) by 2020, compared with levels in 2005. Most European 
countries have offered more ambitious cuts, while China has pushed a target that would allow its carbon dioxide output to continue to grow with its economy, though at a slower 
pace. 

In a study last year, Weiss and colleagues took air samples and found that levels of nitrogen trifluoride, an industrial gas 17,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide as an 
atmospheric warming agent, were four times above what industry estimates had suggested. 

He says that monitoring equipment must be significantly upgraded around the world to prevent similar fudging of data if a deal is reached in Copenhagen. 
Todd Stern, a lead negotiator for the U.S. delegation, says he's pushing for a system that "allows countries to look at each other and get confidence that everybody is doing 
what they said they were doing." 

But governments in India and China -- which is the world's biggest carbon emitter -- have resisted proposals that would allow for verification of data. 
Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish economist, says the results reflect a "failed strategy" in the last two decades of international environmental talks. 
"Conferences like Copenhagen allow the politicians to go back home and say, 'We've got a deal!' But then the targets are almost never kept," says Lomborg, who advocates 

more research and development of clean energy sources to solve environmental problems. 
Even if governments sign a legally binding treaty, there is disagreement among countries about how to enforce any deal. 
The Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 framework under which many countries (not including the USA) agreed to emissions cuts, contains no financial penalties for governments that fail 

to meet their goals. Most of the Western European nations that signed the protocol saw their emissions increase, without repercussions. 

The Obama administration is advocating a "sunshine policy" in which countries would not face serious consequences for non-compliance with emissions goals, says Stephen 
Porter, an attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law. 
"There's no hammer, no nothing," Porter says. He says China would be unlikely to agree to such a condition, and the USA may not be in a position to pressure its biggest 

creditor for more concessions. 
That may not be enough to please those in the Senate, which is deliberating on an energy bill that would implement whatever emissions cuts President Obama promises in 
Copenhagen. Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., is among those who say any deal must carry strong enforcement measures to protect U.S. industry from its competitors abroad. 

One possibility would be "border adjustments," a provision that would allow countries to impose tariffs or other penalties on trading partners who fail to meet their environmental promises, says Duncan Hollis, a Temple University law professor and former attorney for treaty affairs at the State Department. 
"From a lawyer's perspective, or even as a parent, for God's sake, unless you set a set of rules, your kids won't respect them," Porter says.

Full Text 
Now that the United States and other countries are finally moving to seriously address global warming, polluter-funded front groups and their allies in Congress are making exaggerated claims about stolen e-mails from climate scientists in a last ditch effort to derail action. 
Yes, scientists must hold their work up to the highest standards of scientific integrity. And yes, some of the contents of the purloined e-mails raise legitimate concerns, such as how scientists should respond to freedom of information requests. Nevertheless, it is not clear that scientists actually attempted to hinder the free exchange of scientific information. 
More important, nothing in these private messages among a handful of scientists changes our understanding of how human activity is driving global warming and what we need to do about it. Climate science is based on evidence and the work of thousands of scientists at hundreds of research institutions. 
We should not let this manufacturedscandal overshadow the facts: Global warming is accelerating faster than expected -- and we need to act quickly to curb emissions. 
The 2000s are the warmest decade on record. Drought and wildfires are becoming increasingly common. Sea level is rising faster than projected. Species from butterflies to polar bears are threatened because they can't adapt. 
At the same time, more carbon dioxide -- the chief heat-trapping gas from burning coal and oil and destroying forests -- is going into the atmosphere than ever before. 
Fortunately, we have the technology to dramatically and swiftly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Energy efficiency, renewable electricity and cleaner cars are available right now. And we can afford to make the transition. These solutions can create jobs, save us money at the pump and on our utility bills, protect our health by cutting air pollution, and strengthen our national security by making us less dependent on foreign oil. 
Even the tobacco industry, at the height of its disinformation campaigns, didn't stoop to the level of attacking lung cancer researchers. We shouldn't let these dishonest tactics distract us from the science or from what we need to do to combat global warming.

Abstract 
To help offset that waste, a large donation will be made to help brick factories in Bangladesh improve their energy efficiency and reduce their reliance on polluting fuels such as coal. 

Full Text 
COPENHAGEN -- From the moment one's airplane descends from the thick fog above Copenhagen, there is no doubt that this city has been given over to the United Nations 
climate summit. 
"Stop climate change!" reads a giant yellow sign on a boat moored just below the flight path. Before travelers even clear customs, they are hit with a barrage of summit-related 
ads -- including one showing an aged President Obama in the year 2020, apologizing for world leaders' failure to stop the planet from warming. 

Free bicycles are available on loan. A giant windmill looms over the conference center. 
"It's like Disneyland for environmental people," marvels Claude Weisler, 23, a French tourist. 
The display of green is all part of a colorful, occasionally amusing effort by corporations, non-profit groups and governments to make the summit as "green" as possible. 
Many are also eager to get their messages out to the 20,000 delegates in town for what is, according to organizers, the biggest environmental summit ever. 
An LED screen outside the conference center counts the number of people supposedly uprooted by climate change -- 308,432 as of Monday afternoon. The count ticks up every 

few seconds. 

Meanwhile, the Danish government is working to address concerns over the waste and pollution produced by the summit, says Svend Olling, Denmark's lead coordinator of 
logistics. 
"Our philosophy is that you have to have the meeting -- but we're doing everything we can to offset the potential damage," Olling says. 
For example, beef is less available than chicken or lamb at the conference center's cafeterias because beef production results in higher greenhouse gas emissions, Olling says. 

The same is true of bottled water, he says. 
The government decided not to hand out the gift bags that are ubiquitous at such conferences. 
"Many people just throw them away," Olling says. 
Olling says they are using the savings to fund $800,000 in scholarships for 11 students to take master's programs in climate or green energy studies. 
When the summit ends, the Danish government will calculate the environmental cost. About 90% of it will come from delegates' air travel, Olling says. Scores of fuel-guzzling 

private planes are flying to Copenhagen for the summit, and hundreds of limousines will be ferrying people around. 

To help offset that waste, a large donation will be made to help brick factories in Bangladesh improve their energy efficiency and reduce their reliance on polluting fuels such as 
coal. 
Meanwhile, around the city, the color green is everywhere: lime green, forest green, pea green, hanging from walls, suspended from rooftops. 
An ice sculpture of a polar bear set up in one of the city's parks, naturally, is melting. 
A photo exhibition in a Copenhagen city square shows picturesque sites around the world and how they might be destroyed if the Earth warms significantly. 
One poster says Chicago could by the end of the century have the same median temperature as parts of Texas. 
Dan Esty, a professor of environmental law at Yale University, says that would involve temperatures at "the very high end" of the range of projections. 
Opposition has surfaced to at least one green initiative by the Danish government. It would save on fuel emissions by sending dead bodies to crematoriums in groups up to 

three at a time in the same hearse. 

The opposition "may be irrational, but as a relative, you're very vulnerable," Danish vicar Poul Joachim Stender told The Copenhagen Post. "The way you treat your dead is also the way you treat the living."

Ruling allows emissions to be regulated: EPA says greenhouse gases are hazard to public health

Abstract 
The finding covers six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, produced as a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. 

Full Text 
The Environmental Protection Agency issued a long-expected ruling Monday that greenhouse gases threaten public health, giving the Obama administration power to regulate smokestack and tailpipe emissions that feed global warming. 
Coming near the start of the international climate change conference now underway in Copenhagen, some experts said the ruling tells the other conference participants the U.S. can now control emissions whether or not the U.S. Congress passes legislative caps. 
"The U.S. is telling the international community we will act even if Congress doesn't get its act together," says David Bookbinder of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C., a member of the legal team that won a 2007 Supreme Court decision that said greenhouse gases are pollutants and subject to Clean Air Act regulation. The ruling required the EPA to decide if global warming threatens human health and if so, to start controlling the emissions. 
"The overwhelming amount of evidence shows the threat is real," EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. 
The finding covers six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, produced as a byproduct of burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Jackson cited global warming risks of heat waves, asthma and rising seas, among others, in making the finding. 
No emission regulations spring immediately from the announcement, but the finding opens the door to stricter car and truck rules expected in March and cement manufacturing rules expected in June. 
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded it is "highly likely" that greenhouse gases largely contributed to a roughly 1-degree Fahrenheit rise in global average temperatures since 1905, and likely will lead to a 3- to 7-degree rise by 2100. 
Jackson said emission limits were intended for large sources of greenhouse gases, those burning hundreds of train cars of coal each year for example, "not small or medium businesses." 
Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio, a $14.4 billion power company, said the announcement signals the need for energy legislation, "rather than the clumsy tool of regulation," to address greenhouse gas emissions. "We've expected this announcement for months."

COPENHAGEN -- Negotiators will kick off a United Nations climate change summit today with immediate talks on one of the most contentious environmental issues: how much 
rich countries should pay poorer ones to pollute less. 
Evo de Boer, the U.N.'s top environmental official, called Sunday for the 192 countries gathering here to formulate a "strong and long-term response" to stop global warming. 
He says developing countries may need as much as $10 billion a year to help adapt their economies to cleaner energy sources than coal, for example. 

Developing countries such as Brazil have said that they will not agree to a broader deal to cut carbon emissions at Copenhagen unless they get the money. 
Most senior leaders won't arrive until the second week of the summit, which runs through Dec. 18. Yet the first week is when low-level technocrats do most of the detailed deal 
making, observers say. 

"By the time the heads of state come, the negotiators are usually done," says Angela Anderson of the U.S. Climate Action Network, an environmental advocacy group. 

Interest in the summit already has overwhelmed its organizers. The U.N. issued a statement Sunday saying that 34,000 people had expressed interest in attending the summit, 
more than double the capacity (15,000) of the conference center. 
Some journalists and members of non-governmental organizations will be turned away during the busiest hours, the U.N. said.

China sets goal to reduce emissions: Pollution cuts depend on size of economy

Full Text 
BEIJING -- China set a firm target to control its emissions of greenhouse gases Thursday, an unprecedented step that bolsters the momentum of climate change talks at next 
month's United Nations summit in Copenhagen. 
The decision by the Chinese government follows a similar announcement by the White House. Taken together, the world's two biggest polluting nations have defined their plans 
for controlling the carbon emissions most scientists say cause global warming. 

China's goal came with a caveat: Rather than say exactly how much it would cut emissions by a certain date -- as most other countries, including the United States, have -­
China said it would cut pollution in proportion to the overall size of its economy. 
China's economy is likely to keep growing at a rapid pace in the coming decades, so that means the country's net carbon emissions could go up, too -- but not at nearly the 
same pace as they otherwise could have. The exact target, according to China's State Council, is to cut emissions as a percentage of economic output by 40% to 45% before 
2020, compared with levels in 2005. 

The decision "really demonstrates that China is a leading, responsible, developing country in taking on this commitment," said Wu Changhua, greater China director for the 

Climate Group, a Britain-based non-profit organization. 
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister hosting the Dec. 7-18 Copenhagen conference, was more cautious. She said China's decision must be analyzed to see how much it 
departs from "business as usual." She said the target is achievable, "but that doesn't mean it will be achieved easily." 

China relies on coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, for 70% of its energy. It already aims to boost energy efficiency by 20% by 2010 and should achieve that target, Wu said. However, progress to date has come by "picking low-hanging fruit," such as closing factories with outdated facilities, she said. 
"It won't be as easy as in the past. Now (China) will need more technology and financing to meet the challenge," Wu said. 
In its statement, Beijing promised "major efforts" to develop renewable and nuclear energies to ensure that non-fossil-fuel power accounts for 15% of the nation's total primary 
energy consumption by 2020. More trees will be planted to grow China's forest area by nearly 100 million acres from the levels of 2005. 

"We will have to pay a high price to reach this target," top government planner Xie Zhenhua told a news conference Thursday. 
He hinted at flexibility over the time frame. "If we receive technical and financial support, we might be able to achieve (the target) at a faster pace," Xie said. 
Such targets will be a major topic at the Copenhagen summit, at which 192 countries will discuss a range of ways to cut pollution and encourage the use of cleaner energy 

sources. 

The White House announced Wednesday that President Obama will go to the conference. He will commit the United States to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 17% 
from 2005 levels by 2020, the White House said. 
Brazil, South Korea and Russia also announced emissions targets in the past week. 
"Now it is clear to the world: The Copenhagen deadline works. One by one, governments from all over the world are delivering before the climate conference next month," 

Hedegaard said in a statement.

Global warming cuts have a price: That's why there will be no treaty out of U.N. Climate Change Conference

Abstract 
Technologies to cut back carbon dioxide emissions from factories and vehicles that feed the global economy add costs to fuel, food and more, an option that appeals neither to industrial nations struggling with the global economic meltdown or developing nations trying to ramp up economic growth. Without a new treaty to halt carbon dioxide emissions, world temperatures could rise an additional 7.2 degrees by 2100, raising fears of widespread crop failures, climate "refugees," rising seas and desertification for regions such as the Southwest. 

Full Text 
How much would you pay to save the world from the threat of global warming? We might find out soon. 
"Everything we do is tied to energy and climate," says climate economist Graciela Chichilnisky of Columbia University. "Not just the electric bill -- that's a minuscule part of it. Not just the food bill. Everything." 
Come Dec. 7-18, representatives of 192 nations are set to meet in Copenhagen at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It's by far the most significant attempt at changing the course of global warming since world leaders met in 1997 in Japan to craft the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed 37 industrialized nations at cutting emissions of six greenhouse gases (such as the carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal, oil and natural gas, aka fossil fuels) by 5.2% from 1990 levels. It was never ratified by the U.S. Senate and expires in 2012. 
But despite predictions that time is running out to corral greenhouse gases, expectations already have been dashed that the Copenhagen sessions will produce a successful replacement for the Kyoto Protocol. 
One reason: Technologies to cut back carbon dioxide emissions from factories and vehicles that feed the global economy add costs to fuel, food and more, an option that appeals neither to industrial nations struggling with the global economic meltdown or developing nations trying to ramp up economic growth. 
President Obama and China's Hu Jintao signaled as much when they spoke Nov. 17. Obama endorsed a "two-step" plan for Copenhagen -- agree to emissions limits there and worry about a legal treaty next year -- and neither leader stated his limits. 
"Copenhagen does not need to come up with the fine print of a climate-change deal," Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Nov. 4 in Barcelona. "But it needs to ensure that the heart of an agreed outcome is functional and the implementation can begin swiftly." 
Still, many observers feel pressure to act sooner than later. Global temperatures have increased about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1906, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Without a new treaty to halt carbon dioxide emissions, world temperatures could rise an additional 7.2 degrees by 2100, raising fears of widespread crop failures, climate "refugees," rising seas and desertification for regions such as the Southwest. 
Greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the atmosphere. A United Nations Environment Programme report in September found effects such as drought, melting sea ice and ocean acidification arriving ahead of, and looking worse than, the IPCC's 2007 projections. 
"Business as usual" leads to an increase of more than 8 degrees, "truly a catastrophic world," says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. "We've spent two decades putting this off. We won't get a second chance." 
Such forecasts, though, met renewed skepticism this week with the disclosure of e-mails stolen from England's University of East Anglia, including climate researchers privately bad-mouthing critics and struggling to explain if global warming is real, why recent years' temperatures didn't exceed 1998 and 2005 levels, the warmest on record. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., says the e-mails show scientists "cooked the science" and has called for an investigation. Climatologist Gavin Schmidt of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, however, said on the RealClimate website that the e-mails contain "no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy," just "a peek into how scientists actually interact." 
Now vs. the future 
Still, what is at stake at Copenhagen, Meyer and other observers say, is the world's choice for the future: one where nations hedge now against the foreseeable risks of warming or gamble today that they won't happen tomorrow, and keep on burning coal and oil. 
So what would a good Copenhagen deal look like? The United Nations' de Boer says it would hold: 
*Greenhouse-gas emission goals for industrialized nations. 
*Emission-free energy goals for developing nations. 
*Promises of money and machinery from industrialized nations to meet those goals. 
*Agreement on how to meet those goals and commitments. 

"The issue is not whether you are for or against climate change, but rather how much are you willing to sacrifice to slow climate change," says Yale economist Robert 
Mendelsohn. 
The U.S. Senate is contemplating bills that might lead to a 17% to 20% cut in U.S. emissions by 2020. In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the costs of creating 

a carbon "market" to achieve such cuts would be about $175 a year by then for the average household. With efficiency measures added, the Environmental Protection Agency 
says the bill proposal would actually lower energy costs for households but cause huge changes in the energy business -- with fossil fuels falling from about 85% of U.S. 
electricity generation today to 30% by 2050 -- costing jobs at coal plants while adding them in solar, wind and nuclear energy. 

A flurry of meetings have led up to Copenhagen, starting with the 2007 session in Bali, where the Bush administration committed the nation to taking part in Copenhagen. The 
road to Copenhagen really started, however, in 1992, when the USA signed on to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to keep global 
warming effects below "dangerous levels." 

So what's dangerous? In March, a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report updating earlier danger estimates found nothing but negative consequences should 

global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The present concentration of carbon dioxide, the biggest player in global warming greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere stands at about 388 parts per million, compared with 
roughly 270 ppm prior to the Industrial Revolution. At the atmospheric equivalent of 450 ppm concentrations, the world faces a 50% chance of seeing global temperatures rise 
more than 3.6 degrees. 

"The meeting's challenge is to get developed nations on line to economies that are low-carbon, and get developing nations investing in energy technologies that allow them to 
grow without entering the carbon-emitting trap," says Frances Beinecke, author of Clean Energy Common Sense: An American Call to Action on Global Climate Change. 
"Copenhagen has to send them a signal that we are serious." 

In the U.S. Senate, that signal, a clean-energy bill, looks unlikely to pass this year as legislators look at the details, says Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a sponsor of one leading 

proposal. The bills all center on creation of a national "cap-and-trade" system, where rights to emit greenhouse gases are capped, and then sold and traded among industries. 
Meanwhile, de Boer says, industrialized nations would more likely have to cut emissions about 80% to not cross the 450 ppm danger line. In 2007, the IPCC estimated such a 
cut would trigger a 3% reduction of the global economy, an impossible proposition amid a global recession, says David Victor of the University of California-San Diego. 

"As soon as we put a price on carbon, the increased price will pass all the way down (to consumers)," says Jae Edmonds of the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the 
University of Maryland. "When I consider my home heating-oil bill, my natural-gas bill in the winter, the prices will drive decisions." 

A practical approach 
Doing nothing costs, too. In October, for example, a National Research Council panel estimated that burning fossil fuels costs $120 billion in health expenses nationwide every 
year, mostly from at least 18,000 premature deaths caused by pollution, with a "middle ground" estimate of climate damages of $350 billion from storms, drought, wildfire and 
related effects. 

"President Obama was just stating the obvious. There is no use in pretending that a full and final treaty will be ready by Copenhagen," Victor says. Expecting 192 nations to 
agree on anything realistic, he adds, seems like a bad strategy. 
Instead, he suggests the major nations releasing greenhouse gases, particularly China and the United States, cut direct deals to save time. 

"I just think that is the most practical approach," he says. 
Chichilnisky says this idea won't work, because poor nations will then barrel down the fossil fuel path to industrialization without a global treaty that gives them a reason to 
invest in low-emission power. 

In 2006, a British government report, the "Stern Review," estimated that addressing climate change through efficiency, low-emission technologies and a cap-and-trade system 
for greenhouse gases, among other steps, would subtract about 1% from global Gross Domestic Product in 2050, as opposed to a roughly 5% to 20% cost to global GDP if 
nothing were done. Mendelsohn and other economists criticized this high cost estimate and its all-or-nothing response to climate change, rather than a step-by-step one. 

"People seeking such a stringent policy that ensures global warming will not be harmful will demand such an expensive strategy that no one will agree to do anything," 
Mendelsohn says. "In contrast, if we sought a moderate policy that will eventually lead to substantial reductions of greenhouse gases, it is very likely one could get global 
agreement in Copenhagen." 

TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE 
Powerhouse topics of discussion 
The International Energy Agency (IAE) says global energy will grow 40% by 2030. Fossil fuels make 75% of energy today, but some technologies can cut greenhouse emissions. 
Coal power 
-- "Clean" coal, with carbon dioxide emissions shunted to underground reserves, is crucial to cutting future greenhouse gases, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change. A big task, it will add to energy bills and require 50% more pipelines than today's U.S. petroleum industry uses. 
Natural gas 
-- Natural gas is the lowest-impact fossil fuel for greenhouse gases and is the fastest-growing energy source nationwide. Even if Copenhagen produces limits on global 

greenhouse gas, natural-gas use is likely to increase -- perhaps 17% worldwide by 2030, IAE says -- because of its low rate of greenhouse emissions. 
Wind power 
-- The renewable-energy source seeing the biggest short-term increase is wind power, with U.S. wind farms raising their capacity 50% in 2008 -- more than 8,500 megawatts. 

Texas, Iowa, California, Minnesota and Washington lead the nation in wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association. 

Leaders vs. global warming Copenhagen hosts global climate treaty talks in December. Some world leaders have offered up greenhouse gas cuts already, and some haven't: 
USA: President Obama has pledged to "take significant mitigation actions and stand behind these commitments" at Copenhagen. But no hard numbers yet. Congress contemplates 17% to 20% cuts. 
China: President Hu Jintao pledged "notable" cuts in growth of emissions by 2020. No hard numbers. But China has signed clean- energy agreements and has stricter gas-mileage rules than the U.S. has. 
United Nations: Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, says industrialized nations need 80% cuts compared with 2005 emissions. 
Maldives: President Mohamed Nasheed pledges his nation will be "carbon neutral" with effectively zero emissions by 2050 and looks to grow algae to store carbon emissions for climate credits. 
Japan: Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama pledges a 25% cut, compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. The campaign pledge revitalized moves toward a world climate agreement in September.

Abstract 
The Mississippi case is one of a small number of global warming cases to test the judiciary's role in the climate debate. *In September, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals made a similar finding in the case of Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co., siding with a coalition of eight states, New York City, and three land trusts in their lawsuit against several coal-burning utilities for emissions. 

Full Text 
A group of 12 Mississippi Gulf Coast homeowners is using a novel legal strategy to try to recoup losses suffered during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
The lawsuit seeks damages from a group of 33 energy companies, including ExxonMobil and coal giant Peabody Energy, electric utilities, and other conglomerates for allegedly 
emitting greenhouse gases that the litigants say contributed to global warming. 
That, the litigants claim, caused a rise in sea levels and increased air and water temperatures fueling the Category 5 hurricane that destroyed their homes. 
The lawsuit, considered a long shot by legal experts, cleared a hurdle last month when a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said it could continue, overruling a 

circuit court judge who had agreed with arguments from the companies that global warming is a political, not legal, issue. 
The key to the appeal was in the legal strategy, said Robert Percival, director of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Maryland. Rather than asking the court to 

force the companies to stop emitting greenhouse gases, the lawsuit asks for a ruling on whether damage suffered by the homeowners can be traced back to those emissions, he 
said. 
"Just because climate change is difficult, courts aren't going to shy away from their traditional role in weighing issues of harm," Percival said. 

F. Gerald Maples, the New Orleans attorney representing the homeowners, said what the defendants did is legal, but homeowners want to be compensated for the damage allegedly caused by their actions. 
The Mississippi case is one of a small number of global warming cases to test the judiciary's role in the climate debate. 
*In September, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals made a similar finding in the case of Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co., siding with a coalition of eight states, New York 
City, and three land trusts in their lawsuit against several coal-burning utilities for emissions. 

The lawsuit asks the court for an injunction capping emissions from the companies, claiming the gases are a "public nuisance." The case was dismissed at the district level on 

grounds that it was political, but on appeal, a two-judge panel disagreed. 
*Also in September, a federal judge in the Northern District Court of California dismissed a lawsuit brought by the tribal Alaskan village of Kivalina against 24 energy companies. 
Villagers are seeking $400 million in damages from the companies, claiming global warming had made their village uninhabitable. 

The villagers have appealed the decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Percival said the decisions in the 5th and 2nd Circuits make it likely that the Kivalina ruling will be 

overturned. An opening brief by the plaintiffs is due Feb. 22, court records say. 
Robert Dodge, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the trade association for the oil and gas industry and a defendant in the Mississippi lawsuit, declined to 
comment on the case, as did Scott Winkelman, an attorney representing many of the coal company defendants. 

In court filings, attorneys writing for a group of 10 coal companies named in the lawsuit, argued that the homeowners' claims are a political debate dressed up as a lawsuit. "The judicial branch of government is not equipped with a better set of 'manageable standards' than the political branches for resolving the challenges presented by the scientific theory of global warming," they wrote 
Despite the 5th Circuit ruling, William Walsh, a former Environmental Protection Agency attorney now in private practice, said the odds are long against the homeowners. 
"Let's just assume for a moment that the court accepts global warming as being caused by various emissions. You then have to say that that emission caused, in a legal sense, 
Hurricane Katrina and was the primary cause of the actual injury," he said. "There are numerous hurdles here."

Imperfect 'cap-and-trade' is best option to fight warming

Full Text 
Reasonable people can disagree about how bad global warming will eventually be if nothing is done, and some of the doomsday scenarios might well be overblown. But virtually all climate scientists concur that it's a dire enough threat that the wise course of action is to sharply curb use of carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. 
Ideally, that would happen without raising costs to consumers or causing some job loss, but that's a little like saying it would be nice to go to heaven without doing what's necessary to get there. Solar, wind, nuclear and virtually all lower-emission energy alternatives will cost more, at least initially. The only sure way to move from traditional fuels to a greener mix anytime soon is to begin making it more expensive to continue on the current path and let the market work out the most effective way to do it. 
The simplest solution would be a gradually rising tax on carbon-based fuels. In the real world, however, that is a political non-starter, and any tax would inevitably become complex after Congress got done writing in exemptions and discounts for various groups. Further, a tax wouldn't set a hard limit on greenhouse gas emissions. 
That leaves the "cap-and-trade" approach pending on Capitol Hill. 
There are plenty of reasons to dislike cap-and-trade. It's complex, intrusive and would cost money and jobs. But if the threat of human-induced global warming is real, and the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence suggests that it is, this plan or something like it is probably the best tool the political system can produce to begin to counter it. 
Cap-and-trade gets its name from the way it would work: Cap greenhouse gas emissions; sell or give away permits for emissions that are allowed; and have utilities, factories and other emitters trade those permits in a special market. A utility, for example, could either fix its plant to emit less greenhouse gases or buy permits from some other business to keep emitting a higher amount. Over time, the cap would get tighter and the permits more expensive. 
It's complicated, but it works. Europe's cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases, in place since 2005, has helped cut emissions 5% below 1990 levels, and reductions are on track to more than double by 2012. Closer to home, the U.S. began battling acid rain in 1990 with a cap-and-trade regime for sulfur dioxide, which combines with water vapor in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid. That plan worked better than even its supporters hoped, slashing emissions at far less cost than projected. 
To combat climate change and promote clean energy, the House passed a cap-and-trade bill in June on a 219-212 vote that demonstrated how controversial the measure is. The Senate is waiting to take it up sometime after health care, and it won't be easy. Every Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted the session when the panel approved a bill this month. 
The House plan certainly needs improvement. It is stuffed with favors for well-connected lobbies, a distasteful reminder of Congress' inability to focus sharply on the national interest. And critics claim consumer costs would be in the range of $3,000 or $4,000 a year per household. But the neutral, non-partisan Congressional Budget Office paints a more manageable picture. 
CBO's analysis of the House bill forecasts an average net cost per household of $175 a year, with the lowest-income households receiving $40 a year in benefits and the highest-income households paying $245. CBO projects that job loss could be "significant" in industries tied to traditional fuels but would be offset by new jobs elsewhere. That all seems an acceptable price compared with the potential consequences of global warming -- melting ice caps, rising sea levels, droughts and wildfires, shifting agricultural patterns and political instability. 
Perhaps the most potent arguments against cap-and-trade are that unilateral U.S. action wouldn't be enough to reverse global warming, and that it would be self-destructive for the U.S. to act without ensuring that rapidly growing greenhouse gas polluters, such as China and India, also limit emissions. 
Taken together, though, these criticisms amount to an argument for doing nothing, which is simply not an option after years of official U.S. indifference. When world leaders gather next month in Copenhagen to try to set a framework for international action, they'll be looking to the U.S. for direction. 
It's true that if the U.S. acts, there's no guarantee others will go along. But it's a virtual certainty that if the U.S. doesn't lead, then no one else is likely to follow.

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The world's solar companies gathered here recently amid the nation's largest solar market under a brilliant sun -- and the looming shadow of China. 
China leads the world in making solar cells, the key component in solar panels, many of which are exported to the U.S. 
But China is setting itself up to do more than just manufacture components for renewable energy, such as wind and solar. It's also spending heavily to build its own domestic 

market as it attempts to battle its greenhouse gas emissions, electrify its nation of 1.3 billion people and curb its massive pollution problem. 
The buildup of a huge market in China for renewable energy is luring global manufacturers and research teams to China, energy executives say. That's causing concern in some 

corners that China -- not the U.S. -- will emerge as the hub of the new industries, leaving the U.S. as dependent on foreign nations for solar panels, wind turbines and other green-energy equipment and technology as it is on the Mideast for oil. "The Chinese government has recognized that these industries are the 21st century's industries of importance, and it wants to be the Silicon Valley of renewables," says Alan 
Salzman, CEO of U.S.-based VantagePoint Venture Partners, which specializes in clean energy and clean tech investments. 
He says the U.S. hasn't been as clear or as determined as China, a stance echoed by Energy Secretary Steven Chu in testimony before a Senate committee last month. 
While China spends about $9 billion a month on clean energy development, the U.S. "has fallen behind," Chu said. He noted that the world's largest turbine-making company is 

headquartered in Denmark, that 99% of batteries for America's hybrid cars are made in Japan and that the U.S. has lost most of its solar cell manufacturing industry. 
Although Chu said he remained confident that the U.S. can "make up the ground," China is shaping up as a formidable competitor. 
China's government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, which is scheduled to account for 15% of its fuel by 2020. 
Race for investments 
The U.S. has no national target. Two dozen states have their own -- some more aggressive than China's -- but they don't carry the cachet of a national standard, says Denise 

Bode, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. That has hindered the U.S. in attracting wind manufacturers and investments, she says. 
"This is a footrace as to whether we attract them or China does," Bode says. 
Already, China has made rapid gains in building up its domestic renewable-energy industries. 
This year, it's expected to install more new wind-generation capacity than any other country, a spot occupied by the U.S. last year, says the Global Wind Energy Council, a 

Brussels-based trade association. 

By 2013, China is expected to become the world's biggest producer of wind energy, the council estimates. Recently, it eclipsed everyone in wind-turbine-making capacity, up 
from "nothing" five years ago, says Steve Sawyer, the trade group's secretary general. 
China is muscling up on solar, too. Within five years, it's expected to be the No. 1 solar market, says Steven Chan, strategy chief for China's Suntech Power Holdings, the world's 

biggest maker of solar panels. Suntech plans to open its first U.S. manufacturing plant next year in Arizona. 

One big reason China can move so fast? Once its central government decides on a policy, it can execute quickly through the nation's handful of state-owned utilities, Chan says. 
In the U.S., there are thousands of electric utilities and a barrage of regulatory and environmental hurdles to starting new projects. 
"China is pushing harder on solar now than anywhere in the world," says Mark Pinto, chief technology officer for the U.S.-based Applied Materials. "In China, nothing is too fast. 

They've got the land, the need and fast decision-making." 
Applied is the biggest maker of equipment to make solar panels. Last month, it opened the world's largest solar research facility -- in China. 
"If the manufacturers are in China, that's where we need to go," Pinto says. 

U.S. firms have stakes there Other companies have also stepped up profiles and investments in China, including: *Duke Energy, a leading U.S. power company. It signed agreements this fall with two Chinese energy firms to co-develop energy technologies, including solar and coal-fired 
plants to capture and store carbon emissions. 
Rather than sell to the Chinese market, Duke expects the alliances to provide, among other things, rich testing ground for new technologies that can be later deployed in the 

U.S., lowering costs for Duke customers, says David Mohler, Duke chief technology officer. "China has such incredible scale and ability to move quickly," Mohler says. "We will be able to bring new technology to market faster." One example: Duke is spending $17 million to study the capture of carbon produced at its new coal gasification power plant in Edwardsport, Ind. While Duke is studying the 
technology in the U.S., "in China, they're already doing it," says Mohler. "My team of engineers can go over there and learn from them." 
*Arizona-based First Solar. In September, it signed a deal in China to build the world's largest solar farm, roughly the size of Manhattan. Once completed by 2019, it'll produce enough electricity to power 3 million homes, First Solar says. *Vestas, the Denmark-based world leader in wind-turbine manufacturing. It started investing in manufacturing plants in China in 2005 and in the U.S. two years later. Vestas 
CEO Ditlev Engel says that the U.S. and China are both strong wind markets but that China has been more committed. 
China's wind industry is growing so fast that 70 new competitors to Vestas emerged last year, vs. "not many" in the U.S., Engel says. "There's been a lot of uncertainty in the U.S.," he says. "People have waited to invest." Little of China's wind-turbine equipment is exported, but that's poised for change. Recently, a consortium of Chinese and American companies announced plans for a 36,000­
acre wind farm in West Texas. The farm, to be one of the biggest in the U.S., will use wind turbines made in China, the companies say. 
Earlier this month, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., urged the Obama administration to block any federal stimulus money from helping to finance the $1.5 billion project unless it relied on American-made turbines. Over time, Chinese manufacturers will drive turbine prices down, as they have solar panel prices, predicts Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council. Panel prices have 
plummeted about 50% in the past 18 months, in part because of Chinese competition. 
Some energy executives argue that lower prices drive adoption of renewable energy, creating higher-value jobs in America, such as for installers to put up solar panels and engineers to manage systems. "The more you lower the cost of solar panels, the more total jobs you get," says Jeffery Wolfe, CEO of the nationwide installer GroSolar. It buys Chinese panels because they're 
less expensive and of comparable quality to U.S.-made panels, he says. 
'The crunch is on' 
China doesn't look like a poster child for green energy. More than 70% of its energy comes from coal, which produces more carbon than other fuels. Pollution is rampant. But 

industries and economies have been transformed before, and new leaders have emerged, says venture capitalist Salzman. 

He points to biotechnology firms such as Genentech and Amgen, which have grown into innovation leaders in the drug industry. Likewise, data communication usurped 
telecommunication, and new entrants such as Google challenged old giants such as AT&T, Salzman says. 
"In the transformation of clean technology, it's up for grabs whether the giants will be American or Chinese or from other countries," says Salzman. 
The U.S., under the Obama administration, has stepped up its renewable energy investments. The government is pouring $80 billion in stimulus funds to spur development of 

electric vehicle batteries, increased use of renewables, energy efficiency measures and smart grids. 
'Jury is still out' 
The U.S. isn't too late, "but the crunch is on," says Mark Fulton, Deutsche Bank Asset Management's head of climate change investment research. 
While China will be one of the world's largest markets for green energy, the "jury is still out" as to whether it'll be the center of innovation for the industry, concluded a 

September report by the China Greentech Initiative, a consortium of dozens of U.S. and Chinese companies, including Cisco Systems and Westinghouse. 
China faces challenges. Up to 30% of its wind capacity wasn't connected to the grid in 2008, the Greentech Initiative report said, in part because of lack of transmission lines. 

State-owned Chinese companies with locks on local markets may limit innovation, the report noted. And while China's government is plowing big money into the market, other 
sources of capital tend to be fewer than in developed nations, the report said. 
Yet, Pinto and others say China sits on the cusp of an opportunity it may not have had before. 
China's companies have historically been successful because of their low-cost manufacturing of existing technology rather than from innovation of new technologies. 
Now, China needs all the new, cleaner energy it can produce as fast as possible. 
By 2025, 350 million Chinese -- almost the population of the USA -- will migrate from rural areas to cities not yet built, says Duke's Mohler, citing research projections. They'll 

need electricity. 
"This time, China has gotten in on the ground floor," Applied Materials' Pinto says.

Congress has the opportunity to promote cleaner, affordable, homegrown American energy that will result in lower carbon emissions. Unfortunately, many remain preoccupied with energy tax-raising and job-killing cap-and-trade bills to address climate change. Until we can come together to push solutions where we agree, both the American people and the environment will suffer. 
Many are calling on the U.S. to cap its carbon emissions. I support cutting carbon emissions; I just want to do it without killing jobs and raising energy costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Washington's official money scorekeeper, says that cap-and-trade climate change legislation would hurt the economy and cost U.S. jobs. Even CBO is probably underestimating the costs because CBO looked at only the cheapest first 10 years of the 40-year legislation. In later years, the legislation and its costs become even greater. 
Many Americans might not know much about CBO, but they do know about job losses, high energy bills, the pain at the pump and the troubles of providing for a family during these tough economic times. Missouri families and workers are struggling to make ends meet and fighting to keep their jobs. They cannot understand why we will make their lives more expensive with higher energy costs and policies that would send their manufacturing jobs to countries that produce energy at a cheaper cost, such as China. They also do not understand why we might sign an international treaty letting China and India off the hook of emissions cuts, especially when scientists tell us that the U.S. acting alone would have no impact on world temperatures. 
More than 30,000 Missourians recently sent cards to my office decrying cap-and-trade legislation that would raise their retail electricity rates up to 26% by 2012, 42% by 2020, and as much as 77% under worst case scenarios. The University of Missouri's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute found that cap-and-trade would raise production costs at a representative Missouri grain farm by $11,650 in 2020 and $30,150 in 2050. These are costs my Missouri constituents do not want to pay, especially when U.S. unemployment tops 10%. Yet, that is exactly the environmental policy of cap-and-trade advocates: Make energy more expensive so people use less of it. 
I think there is a better way than inflicting pain on the American people. I say cut carbon emissions without raising energy prices and killing jobs with zero-carbon nuclear energy, low-carbon biofuels, low-carbon technology to clean coal emissions, low-carbon hybrid and plug-in vehicle technology, energy efficiency and conservation where it makes economic sense, and opening U.S. reserves of clean natural gas. These are carbon-cutting strategies where we can come together, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to do so as soon as possible.

Abstract 
The business lobby endured the defection of high-profile members such as Apple over its opposition to proposed climate-change legislation, was punked by a left-wing group that staged a phony press conference in its name and even saw the president publicly brand one of its ads "completely false." [...] that implies some degree of uncertainty and some degree of instability, said John Surma, CEO of U.S. Steel. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Calling it a mission behind enemy lines might be an overstatement. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel didn't actually crawl beneath barbed wire or observe radio silence as he made his way from his office to the imposing limestone structure directly across Lafayette Square. 
But when the president's top aide sat down last week with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce board of directors, it marked a meeting of political combatants in a relationship that in recent weeks had grown increasingly adversarial. 
Emanuel's appearance came after several rocky weeks for the chamber. The business lobby endured the defection of high-profile members such as Apple over its opposition to proposed climate-change legislation, was punked by a left-wing group that staged a phony press conference in its name and even saw the president publicly brand one of its ads "completely false." 
Suddenly, the nation's largest business group found itself in the political cross hairs as it has on few occasions in its 97-year history. And the stakes could scarcely be higher. As the economy leaves behind its once-in-a-century emergency and grinds into recovery, the federal government is more deeply engaged in the market than at any other time since World War II. 
"My job is to represent the broad-based business community. ... We know who we are, and we know what we're doing," says Tom Donohue, the chamber's pugnacious president. 
Neither side is seeking a scorched-earth battle. The chamber wants its voice heard on scores of issues, many of which never rise to public attention. And President Obama needs business to create jobs to support his No. 1 priority: shrinking the economically draining and politically threatening jobless rate. 
Indeed, if the chamber has seen smoother days, so has the Obama administration. Unemployment is stubbornly high at 10.2% and likely will tick higher. Major initiatives on health care, climate change and financial regulation are struggling on Capitol Hill. Grumbling among business executives about the difficulty of making investment plans amid so much uncertainty is on the rise. 
"The current administration has a lot of change underway. Naturally, that implies some degree of uncertainty and some degree of instability," said John Surma, CEO of U.S. Steel. "The president was elected on a platform of change, and that's what we're dealing with." 
The frictions aren't going away. The chamber's advocacy of low taxes and light regulation collides with Obama's aggressive use of government to battle the financial crisis, and the two sides represent diametrically opposed views of how Washington should work. It's no surprise that a president who vowed to "tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over" is clashing with an organization that boasts it "leads the pack on lobbying expenditures." 
From ally to what? 
In the beginning, the chamber proved an unlikely ally for the administration's desperate efforts to prevent a wounded economy from collapsing. After backing the Bush administration's controversial Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the group swung behind Obama's $787 billion fiscal stimulus measure to prevent the country from falling into "a depression," Donohue says. 
"This wasn't just a matter of support. There are lot of people, including people in the White House, who wonder whether they could have gotten this passed if we didn't go help them get the critical last votes to make that happen," he adds. 
The chamber also had kind words for the administration's China policy and several Cabinet appointments. But as the year wore on, and the economic panic eased, the chamber increasingly battled the administration on health care, climate change and new consumer protections. 
A new chamber ad campaign promoting "free enterprise" also irked the White House. Donohue says the aim is simply to remind people of free markets' virtues, when they might be tempted to look to government. "What created the greatest economy in the history of the world -- more jobs, more innovation, more productivity, more everything? It's the free enterprise system," he says. 
Inside the White House, the ads look like a political broadside intended to put an activist president on notice: this far and no further. 
The chamber was happy to bend its free market principles when the beneficiaries were bailed-out big businesses, says Valerie Jarrett, senior White House adviser and one of Obama's closest aides. It's only rediscovered its virtue when the focus shifted to spreading health care to the uninsured or safeguarding consumers from reckless banks. "The two positions seemed incongruent to us and somewhat self-serving," she adds. 
Climate change has been especially problematic. The chamber stumbled early when one of its officials publicly called for evaluating the scientific evidence behind global-warming claims in "the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century," a reference to the infamous 1925 Tennessee courtroom showdown between evolution and creationism. 
Three utilities -- Exelon, PG&E and PNM Resources -- all quit the chamber because of its hard-line climate-change stance. Apple also quit over the same issue, while Nike gave up its seat on the chamber board. 
John Rowe, Exelon's CEO, castigated the chamber for its "stridency" in opposing climate-change legislation when he announced on Sept. 28 that the company would drop its membership. 
Donohue dismissed the defections. "The environmentalists got four guys to quit. You know, we've got 300,000 members," he says. "We might get four more to quit. But we've got 'em signing up by the dozens." 
Bruce Josten, the chamber's chief lobbyist, says it supports action on climate change and is being singled out for its opposition -- shared by dozens of Democrats and other business groups -- to what he calls jobs-destroying House legislation. The activist group The Yes Men staged a phony Washington press conference Oct. 19, impersonating chamber officials and announcing that they now backed the bill. The chamber later filed a lawsuit against the group, alleging misappropriation of intellectual property. 
On Nov. 3, the chamber endorsed a proposal floated in an op-ed by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., which would marry reductions in greenhouse gases with expanded use of nuclear power, so-called clean coal and offshore oil and gas drilling. 
A paradigm shifts 
Some Republicans say the business community is having second thoughts about the president. The administration was slow to fill important jobs and, to corporate eyes, its policymakers seem long on academic expertise and short on business acumen. 
"They thought they could work with the administration. They thought they could work with Democrats in Congress. What they're finding out now is they can barely minimize the damage they're going to suffer in the form of legislation, regulation and tax policy coming from Washington," says Tony Fratto, a deputy White House press secretary in the Bush administration. "All those CEOs a year ago who thought it would be really cool to be out supporting Barack Obama are now having a little bit of buyer's remorse." 
From neighborhood machine shops to the Fortune 500, unease about the consequences of administration initiatives in several areas is having a chilling effect on investment. The impact of the unease is impossible to quantify: No one reports investments not made because of politics. But economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com says any effect is likely dwarfed by fundamental financial forces. 
"These broad economic problems are No. 1 on people's minds: the lack of demand, lack of pricing, lack of credit. These are the things that matter in the here and now. These other (political) things are secondary for the vast majority of business," says Zandi, who has advised politicians in both parties. 
Jarrett, the president's liaison to the business community, dismisses talk of any rupture between the chamber and the White House: "Absolutely, we are not at war." Donohue agrees. 
But Obama's approach to policymaking is designed to dilute the influence of traditional Washington powers such as the chamber. Since mid-June, more than 75 chief executives have attended small group meetings with the president or his top economic advisers, often over a meal. The heads of Coke and Pepsi, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble, Avon, Wal-Mart, Lockheed Martin and Boeing all have attended. 
"There's been a paradigm shift in Washington as the result of the president's election, and although the chamber has a voice at the table, it's not an exclusive voice," Jarrett says. "I think that the chamber and other large lobbying groups in Washington have had a tradition of dominating the conversation. Our approach is to be more inclusive." 
Presidents always have met with corporate chieftains. But Jarrett says the frequency of the meetings and the regular participation of the president and his top economic officials distinguish the Obama administration. The CEO outreach, she says, was planned long before relations with the chamber soured. 
Likewise, the administration's affinity for dealing with front-line corporate players subtly tilts the playing field. Other business associations -- notably the CEO-heavy Business Roundtable -- weigh in on many of the same issues as the chamber. But Ivan Seidenberg, the roundtable chairman, is also the CEO of Verizon. And when John Castellani, the roundtable president, shows up at the White House, he brings CEOs who head the group's individual issues committees. 
"We probably learn more from the Business Roundtable, because the people who come in are wearing two hats, whereas mostly the chamber comes in with Tom Donohue and the appropriate staff person as opposed to their members," Jarrett said. 
When Donohue talks of lobbying, he speaks of the constitutionally protected right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The Obama administration, however, casts lobbying as emblematic of a dysfunctional Washington culture that profits "special interests" at the expense of "the people." 
"There is an enormous amount of entrenched self-interest in the status quo here in Washington. People are paid a lot of money to try to reinforce the status quo. ... That's why the president ran for office: He wanted to disrupt that status quo, because it doesn't serve the people of this country," Jarrett says. 
Says Donohue, "They're very naive about that. They have more problems with the special interests on their left than they have on the right." 
Case by case 
In Washington's black-and-white thinking, political players are either up or down, winning or losing. The reality is often a more nuanced palette of grays. Despite the public skirmishing with the White House, for example, chamber representatives interact every day on routine matters with agencies throughout the executive branch. 
Likewise, from all accounts, Rahm Emanuel's Nov. 4 appearance at the chamber passed without fisticuffs. The ensuing discussion of education issues was praised as "productive" by both sides. Wary cooperation, determined on a case-by-case basis, seems to be a status quo both the White House and chamber can abide. 
"We will find a large portion of what is being proposed that we can work on together. Are we going to love everything?" Donohue says. "I don't think so."

Abstract 
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee began hearings Tuesday on its version of a bill to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and to promote clean energy alternatives. 

Full Text 
President Obama trumpeted plans for renewable energy on Tuesday, announcing $3.4 billion in economic stimulus funding to help upgrade the nation's electric grid. 
Obama said grants will be awarded to revamp power lines, generators and meters in the century-old power network so that it becomes a "smart grid." The federal government's money will be added to industry funding, so the total investment will be more than $8 billion, the White House says. The existing grid "wastes too much energy, it costs us too much money, and it's too susceptible to outages and blackouts," Obama said after touring the largest solar energy 
plant of its kind, in Arcadia, Fla. The grid's deficiencies were highlighted by a 2003 blackout that affected 50 million people in the Northeast, Midwest and part of Canada. 
Luke Clemente, general manager of General Electric's smart-grid business, hailed the grants as a key "economic and global competitiveness tool" that will help consumers "have the power to manage and control their energy use." Florida Power & Light, which operates the plant Obama visited Tuesday, will spend its $200 million grant to install 2.6 million smart digital meters. These meters allow utilities to 
offer variable prices to reflect wholesale power costs, with rates that are highest at peak usage times. 
Obama also made a pitch for energy legislation pending in Congress. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee began hearings Tuesday on its version of a bill to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and to promote clean energy alternatives. The bill will "finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America," Obama said. The legislation also will "make the best use of resources we have in abundance 
through clean coal technology, safe nuclear power, sustainably grown biofuels, and energy we harness from the wind, waves and sun," he said. 
Obama also stumped in Norfolk, Va., for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds.

Unity doomed apartheid. Next up: climate change

Abstract 
The growing consensus is that it's the most carbon we can have in the atmosphere without causing terrible climate havoc. Since we're already past that level, at 390 parts per million, it also implies that we need much swifter political action than governments have supported in the past to reverse this trend. 

Full Text 
The intense debate about dealing with climate change has mostly taken place in rich countries. The United States, European Union and China have driven negotiations, and every top-level conversation has been about what's thought to be possible -- and often what's convenient -- for these strong forces. 
But as the countdown begins to the decisive Copenhagen climate talks in December, new voices are making themselves heard. These victims have become more demanding as the realities of climate change have become more apparent. Maplecroft, a global risks security group, lists 28 countries as most vulnerable to climate change, and 22 of them are in Africa. 
Last month, the African Union's chief negotiator at the climate talks, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, said Africa not only would demand fair compensation for climate damage from the countries that caused the problem, but would also demand that rich nations cut emissions and hold global warming to as few degrees as humanly possible. 
Science on our side 
The new African assertiveness stems from new science. After Arctic sea ice melted dramatically in 2007, scientists began re-evaluating their predictions. It became clear that basic survival was at stake for many countries. The low-lying islands of the Maldives, though poor, have begun saving a portion of each year's national budget to buy a new homeland if, and when, their current home sinks beneath the waves. Kenya's ongoing drought vividly illustrates what uncontrolled climate change might bring to the African continent. 
Many top scientists agree that there's a number the world needs to know. It's 350 -- as in 350 parts per million of the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The growing consensus is that it's the most carbon we can have in the atmosphere without causing terrible climate havoc. Since we're already past that level, at 390 parts per million, it also implies that we need much swifter political action than governments have supported in the past to reverse this trend. It also means, among other things, that we need a rapid effort to replace the burning of polluting coal with cleaner energy sources everywhere. 
350 and counting 
Normally, voices from places such as Ethiopia, the Maldives and Kenya are sidelined in international forums. But this time, it might be different because a determined movement is building around the world. 
This Saturday, 350.org, an organization that I support, will coordinate thousands of events and rallies in 170 countries to bring the number 350 to global attention. 
Sharing the goals of 350.org will be internationally prominent messengers, including the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, and NASA's top climate scientist, James Hansen. 
Groups will gather in the world's most iconic places -- from Table Mountain in Cape Town to the tops of Himalayan peaks. Across the planet, churches will ring their bells 350 times that day. Last weekend, Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed led 13 Cabinet members in an underwater meeting to highlight the country's rising sea levels. People in almost all the nations of the earth are involved. It's the same kind of coalition that helped make the word "apartheid" known around the world. 
In South Africa, we showed that if we act on the side of justice, we have the power to turn tides. Worldwide, we have a chance to start turning the tide of climate change with just such a concerted effort today.

China's coal-plant emissions can be controlled inexpensively: Carbon 'sequestration' promising, report says

Abstract 
Carbon sequestration, which today is used only in a few oil fields and experimental projects, works by capturing carbon dioxide from smokestacks, compressing it and pumping it underground into deep saltwater reservoirs capped by layers of impermeable stone. 

Full Text 
Getting China's coal-plant emissions out of the atmosphere so they don't worsen global warming may be cheaper, easier and longer-lasting than expected, a federal energy lab 
report finds. 
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory report, set for release today in London, says there are vast underground reserves in China that can be used for "carbon 
sequestration," a carbon dioxide-trapping technology considered vital to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. 

"Conventional thinking had been that China did not have a lot of storage for carbon. But it turns out China does," says the lab's Robert Dahowski, the report's lead author. 

"Enough for many decades, perhaps hundreds of years." 
Carbon sequestration, which today is used only in a few oil fields and experimental projects, works by capturing carbon dioxide from smokestacks, compressing it and pumping 
it underground into deep saltwater reservoirs capped by layers of impermeable stone. 

In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that global atmospheric temperature rose about an average of 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century. 

About half of this "global warming" is driven by fossil-fuel-related emissions of carbon dioxide. 
The report finds that the cost of transporting, injecting and monitoring carbon dioxide from China's 1,623 largest sources -- coal, cement, ammonia plants and factories -- would 
average $5 to $7 a ton, about half of estimated costs in the USA. 

Further, China's deep geology features rock layers that are perfect for pumping carbon dioxide underground. The report maps at least 2,300 billion metric tons of potential 

underground storage for carbon in China, Dahowski says. China's major plants emit about 3.8 billion metric tons a year. 
"I would call it good news for the climate," says geologist Julio Friedmann of the Lawrence Livermore (Calif.) National Lab, who was not part of the study. Friedmann says 
China's geology, coal use and low construction costs make pumping carbon underground "low-hanging fruit" to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 

On Monday, Energy Department chief Stephen Chu called for "widespread, affordable" carbon storage in 10 years. Chu noted that coal, on which China and the USA depend for 

electricity, supplies 25% of the world's energy and accounts for 40% of carbon emissions. 
"The next step for carbon sequestration is really just doing it on a large scale," says Stanford's Franklin Orr, who wrote a review of the technology in the journal Science last 
month. "The technology is there already." 

TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE 
How the process works 
China has 90 geologic formations that could "sequester" carbon dioxide from power plants and factories before it can enter the atmosphere. 
1 Burning coal or other fossil fuels produces a concentrated stream of flue gases through various combustion methods. For geologic storage, the gas is captured and sent by 

pipeline to a well over a deep saltwater reservoir. 
2 The gas is compressed and injected into the reservoir, typically capped by impermeable rock. Volcanic basalt layers might also hold the gas. 
3 The gas remains trapped in the reservoir. About 30% of the gas will dissolve into the water within a few decades. Below 2,600 feet, the gas becomes liquid and can be trapped 

in porous rock. 

4 Monitoring of the reservoir continues to ensure there are no leaks, which could pose a health hazard if concentrated gas escapes. But a 2005 Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change report rated it "very likely" such reservoirs would trap 99% of the gas for a century. 
5 Over centuries, much of the gas would dissolve into the saline water deposit, although monitoring probably would continue.

Abstract 
Tina May, a spokeswoman for the Hopi Nation's Tribal Council, said leaders unanimously adopted a resolution declaring that the conservation groups are unwelcome because they have damaged the tribe's economy by pushing to close the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant near Page, Ariz., that produces electricity distributed by providers in Arizona, California and Nevada. 

Full Text 
PHOENIX -- The president of the Navajo Nation joined other Native American leaders this week in assailing environmentalists who have sought to block or shut down coal-fired 

power plants that provide vital jobs and revenue to tribes in northern Arizona. 
"These are individuals and groups who claim to have put the welfare of fish and insects above the survival of the Navajo people when in fact their only goal is to stop the use of 
coal in the U.S. and the Navajo Nation," said Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley Jr., who presides over America's largest Indian reservation, which sprawls over three states and 
claims a population of about 250,000. 

Shirley's remarks came Wednesday after the Hopi Nation's Tribal Council sent a message Monday to the Sierra Club and a handful of other environmental groups: Stay off the 

reservation. 
Tina May, a spokeswoman for the Hopi Nation's Tribal Council, said leaders unanimously adopted a resolution declaring that the conservation groups are unwelcome because 
they have damaged the tribe's economy by pushing to close the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant near Page, Ariz., that produces electricity distributed by 
providers in Arizona, California and Nevada. 

Andy Bessler, Sierra Club representative in the Southwest, expressed dismay at the resolution and noted that another tribal group, Hopis Organized for Political Initiative, 

supports environmental efforts. 
"We work with anybody who wants to help protect the environment, stop global warming and transition our economy to a clean economy," Bessler told the Associated Press. 
"We don't discriminate, and we'll continue to honor the invitations we get from Hopi and Navajo communities to work with them." 

The public castigation of conservation groups represents an unusual breach between Native American tribes and environmentalists, who often work hand-in-hand on political 

causes, according to Ben Nuvamsa, a former Hopi tribal chairman. 
Tribes frequently partner with conservationists to protect resources and sacred sites, said Jerry Pardilla, executive director of the National Tribal Environmental Council. However, 
he added, with 564 diverse tribes, there are times when they get crosswise with the green movement. 

Families depend on mines 
Environmentalists have long campaigned against coal as an energy source, but the Navajo and Hopi say they depend on such revenue. 
This spring, the Sierra Club, Grand Canyon Trust, the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) and some Native American groups called on the Environmental Protection 

Agency to study the Navajo Generating Station's role in causing smog over the Grand Canyon. 
Stephanie Kodish, clean air counsel for the NPCA, complained at the time that the power plant is a source of "excessive pollution." 
The Navajo Generating Station, operated by Phoenix-based Salt River Project, began producing electricity in 1974. It originally cost about $650 million, and $420 million more 

was spent in the 1990s to deal with pollution concerns. The generating station and a reservation coal mine now support hundreds of families, providing more than 70% of the Hopi Nation's governmental revenue, said Scott Canty, tribal counsel. 
Nuvamsa, who resigned as Hopi chairman last year amid political infighting, scoffed at the council's resolution. 
"This group here (the tribal council) has done so much to damage our tribal reputation and to violate our civil rights," he said. "As tribal members, we are all environmentalists 
because we're supposed to take care of Mother Earth." 

Canty said closure of the plant would be devastating for Hopis. 
"The tribe would essentially be penniless," he said. 
Shutdown cost millions 
Environmental campaigns such as the one surrounding the Navajo Generating Station have succeeded in the past. 

Environmentalists successfully closed the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev., in December 2005 after a pollution lawsuit. 
That shutdown cost the tribe more than $6.5 million per year, according to May, and closure of the Navajo Generating Station would wipe out another $11 million. 
Shirley's statement of solidarity with his neighboring Hopi tribe ripped environmentalists for fighting development of Desert Rock Energy Project. This is a $2.5 billion proposed coal-fired power facility that Shirley described as "the most important economic development project in our nation's history." 
Nada Talayumptewa, chairwoman of the council's energy team, said, "We need to make public that we don't want the environmental groups coming in and causing trouble for the Hopi tribe. It's time we take a stand." 
The Sierra Club's Bessler said, "We need to do something about global warming, and coal is the greatest threat."

EPA rule aims to cut facilities' emissions

Abstract 
For the first time, the federal government plans to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions from factories, power plants and other industrial facilities under a proposal revealed Wednesday. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 10/5/2009: A story Thursday should have said that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to regulate industrial facilities that emit more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year. The figure in the story was incorrect. 
WASHINGTON -- For the first time, the federal government plans to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions from factories, power plants and other industrial facilities under a proposal revealed Wednesday. 
The proposed rule requires new facilities and those undergoing major maintenance to limit their greenhouse-gas emissions using the "best available" technology. That might include energy-efficiency steps or equipment under development to capture greenhouse gases and funnel them into storage. 
"We are not going to continue with business as usual any longer. We have the tools and the technology to move forward today, and we are using them," said Lisa Jackson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA would oversee the rule. 
The EPA's plan "will grind economic growth to a halt in cities and communities across America," said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., an opponent of climate-change action. 
The industrial sector is responsible for about one-third of the U.S. output of greenhouse gases, which build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. The primary greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, produced when coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels are burned. 
The proposal would take effect after the administration finalizes its rules for restricting greenhouse gases from vehicles. That's scheduled for next spring. 
The proposal was announced on the same day that a bill to slow climate change was introduced in the Senate. The Senate bill faces an uphill climb to passage, but the EPA plan adds another possible route to restricting emissions. 
The dual announcements Wednesday mean that "the question shifts from whether the government will act and clean up corporate pollution to how it will be done," said Jeremy Symons of the National Wildlife Federation, an environmental group. 
The announcement marks a "seismic shift," said Vickie Patton of the Environmental Defense Fund. 
Jackson said the proposal exempts small businesses and farms from having to reduce their greenhouse gases. Only facilities that emit more than 250,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year would be subject to the rule. That standard means that the regulation would apply to roughly 14,000 U.S. facilities accounting for nearly 70% of the global-warming emissions from sources other than vehicles, the EPA says. 
Charles Drevna, head of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, said his group may sue the EPA. The proposal would make the nation "much less energy secure," he said.

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Senate legislation designed to slow global warming would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions more rapidly than competing legislation passed by the House of Representatives, according to a draft bill obtained by USA TODAY. 
The Senate bill, scheduled to be introduced today, would require a 20% decrease in 2020 in the greenhouse-gas emissions blamed for global warming. The House bill passed in June would require a 17% cut in 2020. 
The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, produced when cars burn gasoline and power plants burn coal. Reducing emissions requires the use of other sources of energy, such as windmills and nuclear plants. 
Like the House bill, the Senate draft also would set up a "cap-and-trade system" to reduce emissions. Companies would have to buy pollution credits to emit greenhouse gases, while those that reduce their pollution could sell or trade the credits. 
One of the most contentious sections of the House bill was the list of industries and other benefactors that would receive free pollution credits, which could eventually be worth billions of dollars. The Senate draft does not spell out who would get free credits, a topic that is likely to be crucial to Senate negotiations. 
The entire draft is "a starting point" said Tony Kreindler of the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group. "It's going to change fairly substantially as they move forward." 
As in the House, the Senate bill would provide financial assistance to workers who lose their jobs because of the legislation. 
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., one of the Senate's most vocal opponents of climate-change action, predicted the bill won't even be debated on the Senate floor before the end of the year, let alone come up for a vote. "Why should Democrats bring up something that's going to further entrench them against the American people?" he asked Tuesday. 
The bill's timetable is critical. Diplomats from more than 180 countries will gather in December to try to hammer out a treaty to slow global warming. 
"Is the U.S. Senate really expecting all the other countries to make a serious effort on climate change ... in the absence of a clear commitment from the United States?" John Bruton, the European Commission's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement this month.

Deal on climate change is elusive: Political, economic issues hinder talks to stop warming

Abstract 
Climate scientists, such as Rajendra Pachauri, head of a U.N.-organized group of thousands of climate experts, say the world is headed for dramatic changes unless nations slash emissions of carbon dioxide -- from cars, power plants and factories -- and other greenhouse gases soon. The U.S. Energy Department says China is the only nation that produces more carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels than the USA. 

Full Text 
Two years ago, more than 180 nations made a bold promise: By the end of 2009, they would draft a sweeping treaty to slow climate change. 
Yvo de Boer, the United Nations' top climate-change official, called the agreement "a real breakthrough," and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed confidence it would produce "a deal ... in 2009 to address the defining challenge of our time." Now the deadline is nearing, and hope is fading. The treaty is supposed to be finalized at talks that start Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, but diplomats have made almost no progress 
toward an agreement -- a point made repeatedly by world leaders Tuesday at the U.N. climate summit in New York City. 
"As we head towards Copenhagen, there should be no illusions that the hardest part of our journey is in front of us," President Obama said at the U.N. 
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt warned of a deadlock. "The negotiations are going far too slowly," he said. 
The debate over climate change is wrapped in a range of political and economic conflicts. 
Climate scientists, such as Rajendra Pachauri, head of a U.N.-organized group of thousands of climate experts, say the world is headed for dramatic changes unless nations 

slash emissions of carbon dioxide -- from cars, power plants and factories -- and other greenhouse gases soon. 
The key question is how to do so without crippling the worldwide economy -- and making such limits fair to industrialized nations such as the United States as well as developing 

nations and rising powers such as China. The U.S. Energy Department says China is the only nation that produces more carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels than 
the USA. 
The notion that such emissions are dramatically changing the climate is widely accepted. 
The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report two years ago saying the odds are better than 90% that global warming is caused by humans. Even 

so, there are holdouts -- notably Republicans in the U.S. Senate, which ratifies treaties involving the USA -- who question whether emissions have much of a role in what they 
suggest is a natural warming of the planet. 
Meanwhile, there are questions about whether even a dramatic reduction in emissions would avoid dangerous climate changes. 
Against that backdrop, the scramble for a deal to combat global warming continues. 
Key nations will take part in climate talks at a flurry of upcoming meetings, including the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh of major economic powers Thursday and Friday and further 

U.N. talks starting Monday in Bangkok. 
The Earth isn't waiting, scientists say. 
If emissions keep increasing as they have, the planet's average temperature will rise 3 to 7 degrees by 2100, according to the U.N. climate panel's 2007 report. 
A temperature rise of more than 3 1/2 degrees could melt the ice covering Greenland -- raising sea levels 20 feet, says climate scientist Jonathan Gregory of Britain's University 

of Reading. 
If Antarctica's ice melts, too, cities such as Hong Kong and Miami would be threatened, MIT climate scientist John Reilly says. 
Scientists at the Hadley Centre reported this year that above 3 1/2 degrees, swaths of the Amazon rainforest will die. 
Despite such dire scenarios, drafting a climate treaty will be "10 times more difficult" than it was in 1997, when diplomats meeting in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to the world's first 

mandatory climate pact, says John Prescott, Britain's former deputy prime minister and an important player in the Kyoto deal. More nations are involved now, Prescott says, and 
they are further apart on how much to cut emissions. 
The worldwide financial crisis is adding to the economic concerns that surround talks on a climate-change treaty. 

Obama acknowledged the economic pressures in Tuesday's speech, saying "every nation's most immediate priority is reviving their economy and putting their people back to work. And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge." 
The Bush administration and the Senate opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it exempted developing nations such as China and India from mandatory emissions cuts, which 
U.S. politicians feared would put the USA at an economic disadvantage. The Senate's lack of approval of the Kyoto treaty helped make the treaty ineffective in cutting emissions. 
Today, many U.S. senators have the same worries they had in the 1990s: that a climate treaty would slow economic growth, make U.S. industry less competitive and drive up energy prices. The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. If the deal making in Copenhagen leads to a new pact that would harm the U.S. economy, "no such treaty or agreement can be approved by 
the Senate," says Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. 
Here are some of the problems confronting the global effort to cool the Earth's temperature: 
Mistrust and finger-pointing 
In Copenhagen, countries are supposed to settle which of them would be required to lower their emissions and by how much. 
The battle over those issues is unlikely to end this year, says Eileen Claussen, head of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and a former U.S. climate official. That's 

because the countries are far apart: 

*The European Union suggested to the U.N. that industrialized countries, including its members, cut emissions by 30% by 2020. Meeting that limit plus another goal to use more solar power and other "renewable energy" would cost tens of billions of dollars in 2020, according to a European Commission study. *China, which considers itself a developing country, wants developed countries to cut emissions 40% by 2020, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China insists it 
should not be subject to mandatory emissions cuts, pointing to its efforts to produce more renewable energy and to become more energy-efficient. 
*A bill passed by the House of Representatives in June would use a carbon-trading system to help cut U.S. emissions 17% by 2020, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group. A similar bill is scheduled to be introduced in the Senate in the next few weeks. The numbers being floated are partly bargaining positions, says former U.S. climate negotiator Rafe Pomerance, now president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a non-profit climate-
change group. But he said nations "end up creating a set of expectations that would be difficult to meet." 
Demands for money 
Several dozen industrialized nations agreed two years ago to dig deeper into their pockets for climate-related aid. 
Developing countries would draw on the funds to cut their own emissions and to cope with the effects of a warming world, such as water-collection projects to guard against 

drought. 

The thorny question is how much money wealthier nations will offer. At negotiations in August, developing countries requested $400 billion a year. A U.N. report released Sept. 1 
pegged the need at more than $500 billion a year. 
That far outstrips the money that developed nations are likely to put on the table, particularly at a time of budget deficits. 
The European Union said Sept. 10 that it would contribute up to $22 billion a year, but the United States has kept quiet. Obama's proposed budget for foreign aid in 2010 is 

$36.5 billion for public health programs, anti-drug campaigns and other projects. 
Developing nations have threatened to derail the talks if their demands aren't met. 
If a treaty "is not consistent with our minimal position," Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Sept. 3, according to Reuters, "we are prepared to walk out of any 

negotiations." 
Senate stalemate 
Twelve years ago, the Senate overwhelmingly opposed a global-warming treaty -- 95 of the 100 senators voted for a resolution against any agreement that would harm the U.S. 

economy. 

U.S. diplomats learned their lesson, Claussen says: Don't settle on a treaty that's likely to be rejected back home. 
This time, U.S. climate negotiators have "made clear" that they won't finalize a treaty without "a very good sense of where Congress is," Claussen says. 
The clock is working against the U.S. team. Introduction of a Senate version of the climate bill has been delayed repeatedly and may not take place until October, in part 

because of the health care debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said last week that a bill may not come up for a vote until 2010. 
The House version includes measures to soften economic impacts of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Among them are financial aid to workers who lose their jobs because of the bill and barriers to importing goods from nations that don't cut emissions. Even so, most Republican senators oppose a bill on climate change, and many moderate Democrats -- especially those from coal and manufacturing states in the Midwest -- are 
worried that such a plan would mean job losses in their states. 
There's also a faction of senators who are skeptical that climate change is a problem at all. 
"A lot of members of Congress ... are absolutely convinced" that humans are the primary cause of global warming, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said last month. "I haven't 

reached that conclusion at this point." 
Scientific realities 
Nearly all the news from scientists add up to one hard truth: It will be extremely difficult to avoid more warming of the Earth. 
Even if carbon dioxide emissions fell to zero tomorrow, the Earth's temperature would continue to rise, says climate researcher Francisco de la Chesnaye of the Electric Power 

Research Institute. 
That's because it takes decades for the climate to adjust fully to a new level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, he says. 
In July, the European Union and 16 of the world's wealthiest nations -- including China and the United States -- signed a statement acknowledging the scientific opinion that the Earth's temperature rise "ought not to exceed" roughly 3 1/2 degrees. 
That's a tall order. The Earth already has warmed 1 1/2 degrees since the late 19th century and will warm another 1 degree by 2100 based on the greenhouse gases already emitted. 
To keep the temperature rise below 3 1/2 degrees, greenhouse gases may have to be cleansed from the atmosphere, says Hugh Pitcher of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
That might be accomplished, say Pitcher and other climate experts, with technology that doesn't yet exist: systems to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it underground. 
"We have got ourselves painted into a little bit of a corner on this one," he says. 
Based on the amount of greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere, achieving the 3 1/2 degree goal "will require huge efforts over the whole century," MIT climate expert Henry Jacoby says. "The kind of agreement that can be reached in Copenhagen can only get started on that task." 
Though it will be difficult to prevent more warming, that doesn't mean "we might as well go home and forget it," Jacoby says. "If we get discouraged and don't do anything, the implications are very, very serious. The risks are very, very great."

Abstract 
Hu's statement "underscores China's seriousness in tackling climate change," said Julian Wong of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. *Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan, who has been on the job seven days, pledged to cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2020, in keeping with a campaign promise he made. 

Full Text 
China and Japan promised new action on climate change during a United Nations climate summit Tuesday, while President Obama said he would work to eliminate international subsidies on fossil fuels such as coal and oil. 
Heads of state from about 100 countries gathered at the summit, which was convened by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. Ban hoped top leaders could overcome the stalemate that has settled over talks on a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. 
At a news conference Tuesday night, Ban said the summit "has put fresh wind in our sails." But he warned that reaching an agreement in Copenhagen in December, as hoped, "will not be easy. It involves an incredibly ... complex negotiating process." 
What leaders said: 
*Obama declared that unless the world acts to slow climate change, "We risk consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe." 
In addition to vowing to work on eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies, he also announced the first U.S. requirement for companies to report emissions. 
Obama offered no new initiatives to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, leading Keya Chatterjee of the World Wildlife Fund, an environmental group, to call Obama's speech "a missed opportunity." 
*President Hu Jintao of China announced new steps to slow emissions growth by his nation, which is the world's No. 1 greenhouse gas polluter, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Hu committed China to getting 15% of its energy from sources other than fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, by 2020. 
Hu also said China would cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with economic growth and committed to reforestation, which would help soak up the key greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. 
Hu's statement "underscores China's seriousness in tackling climate change," said Julian Wong of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. 
*Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan, who has been on the job seven days, pledged to cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2020, in keeping with a campaign promise he made. That's a much steeper reduction than the goal of his predecessor, who wanted to cut 8%. 
Former vice president Al Gore, who was at the U.N., said he was "extremely impressed" by Japan's new target and by Hatoyama's proposal to make low-emissions technologies available to developing nations.

Abstract 
In May, President Obama said his administration would raise fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks by roughly 40% to cut fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas pollution. 

Full Text 
McLEAN, Va. -- The chief of the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that the Obama administration is studying how to curb global-warming gases from big industrial polluters such as power plants and factories. 
In an appearance before the USA TODAY editorial board, Lisa Jackson also said the agency will soon propose rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars. 
"We will continue to move stepwise down the path toward regulation of greenhouse gases," assuming that the EPA adopts a preliminary finding that greenhouse gases are a 
danger to public health, Jackson said. 

In May, President Obama said his administration would raise fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks by roughly 40% to cut fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse 

gas pollution. 
There has been no public announcement about how the administration plans to curb greenhouse gases from industrial facilities. Power plants and other industrial plants produce 
just over half of the nation's greenhouse gases, the EPA says. 

Alhough she is willing to use current law to cut greenhouse gases, Jackson said it would be better if Congress passed climate legislation. A new law would forestall lawsuits, she 

said. The House of Representatives passed a climate-change bill in June. The Senate has not yet acted. 
A law is also preferable because it could fund clean-energy efforts and other programs that would help fight climate change, said Lou Leonard of the World Wildlife Fund, an 
environmental group. However, he said, "if the Congress can't move fast enough, then the EPA should act." 

Industry groups don't want the EPA to tackle climate in the absence of new legislation, said William Kovacs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The existing law that would be 
used as the basis of regulations, he said, would require companies to apply for onerous permits if they want to open new facilities. 
Regulating industrial sources with current law would be "a job killer and a project killer right at the outset," Kovacs said. 

Other issues Jackson addressed: 
*The EPA needs to ramp up its work on air pollution, Jackson said. She noted that federal courts have invalidated EPA rules -- written during the Bush administration -- to 
control smog and other air pollutants. New rules are a priority, she said. 

*Environmental attitudes are changing, she said. Jackson said her sons, ages 13 and 14, were incredulous when they saw a friend's "huge, gas-guzzling" vehicle. "They are 

going to be very different citizens when it comes to green than my generation," she said. 
*A colleague in the administration, Energy Secretary Steven Chu, said Monday on National Public Radio that he'd rather live next to a nuclear plant than a coal-burning plant. 
Jackson declined to specify which kind of plant she'd rather live next to. "I don't know why he did that," she said, laughing.

Abstract 
China pushes solar and wind power technology, plus nuclear plants, but "we can't get away from coal," says S. Ming Sung, Asia-Pacific representative for the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based advocacy group for clean coal technology. 

Full Text 
DALIAN, China -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reminded the world Thursday that China is serious about tackling global warming -- but on its own terms. 
Speaking at a meeting of the World Economic Forum, Wen said his government is increasing efforts to cut greenhouse gases. He said richer, developed countries, including the 
United States, should take the lead in reducing emissions tied to global warming based on their higher per capita emissions and longer history of pollution. 
The leader's remarks highlight the complex negotiations ahead of a United Nations meeting in December to work out a global agreement on climate change. President Obama is 

scheduled to visit China in November. 

"Climate change is a common challenge confronting mankind," Wen told the forum of businesspeople, academics and officials. "Each and every country, enterprise and individual 
should assume a due share of responsibility in meeting the challenge." 
After years of fast-paced growth, China recently overtook the USA as the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which come from burning coal 

and oil. Both nations remain heavily dependent on coal, and together are responsible for half of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. 

The United States has said it is committed to reaching a deal to reduce greenhouse gases at the U.N. meeting in Copenhagen, if other major polluters such as China and India 
do their part. 
"I see the USA and China as crucial to a deal in Copenhagen," said Yvo de Boer, the U.N. official responsible for brokering an agreement. 
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said in Shanghai this week that China and the United States should cooperate to develop clean energy and tap job-creating opportunities. 
The market for green technology in China could be as large as $1 trillion annually, according to the China Greentech Report 2009, released Thursday in Dalian. The first signs of 

a "green transformation" are appearing, said Randall Hancock, co-founder of the China Greentech Initiative, a group of 82 companies, organizations and advisers that issued the 

report. 
China is well-placed to move quickly on "green" products, said Weili Dai, co-founder of Marvell, a Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company with operations in China, and a 
member of the U.S.-China Green Energy Council. "The Chinese government can mandate things very easily, as it's not exactly a democracy," she says. 

China pushes solar and wind power technology, plus nuclear plants, but "we can't get away from coal," says S. Ming Sung, Asia-Pacific representative for the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based advocacy group for clean coal technology. 
"In the U.S., 50% of power is generated from coal, and in China, it is 75% to 80%. Coal will be with us for decades to come," Sung said. 
"The Chinese government will not be pressured by the international community but is realizing the importance of climate change for its own sake," said Wu Changhua, the 
Greater China director for the Climate Group, a coalition that works for climate change. 

De Boer remains optimistic about the upcoming negotiations in Copenhagen. 
"The issue is whether China is willing to announce its domestic ambitions," he said. "I hope that on the road to Copenhagen, the USA and China can find even more on which to 
agree."

Renewable energy plan creates rift: Environmentalists at odds over administration's idea to use vast federal lands

Abstract 
Gazing across the desert valley, power company executives, environmentalists and federal land managers stand beneath a cloudless sky and argue over the landscape. After decades of allowing private companies to lease public lands for coal and oil, "we have started a new beginning" to make room for solar mirrors and wind turbines, he says. 

Full Text 
AMBOY, Calif. -- The morning heat hits triple digits as a whiptail lizard darts below a creosote bush near Route 66. Gazing across the desert valley, power company executives, 
environmentalists and federal land managers stand beneath a cloudless sky and argue over the landscape. 
PG&E project manager Alice Harron says she is "comfortable" with the solar power plant her utility wants to build on government land here along 4 miles of the Mother Road 
that connected Chicago and Los Angeles long before the interstate system. 

David Myers of the Wildlands Conservancy is not. Renewable energy projects such as this one -- which could power 224,000 homes -- sound good in theory, he says, but if they 

tear up pristine vistas, they're not "green." 
President Obama wants a "clean-energy economy" that relies on renewable sources such as solar and wind power instead of coal and oil. He wants to put these new utilities on 
federally owned lands like this stretch of the Mojave Desert, one of the sunniest places on Earth. 

The administration wants to lead the way by taking advantage of its vast holdings, which account for 20% of all land in the USA, mostly in the West. 

That idea is creating a rift among environmentalists, who favor renewable energy but are at odds over where to produce it. Some are willing to compromise with utility 
companies to build large power plants on remote federal lands to accelerate the transition to clean energy. 
Purists are dead set against disturbing pristine landscapes. 
Obama's goal is to meet 25% of the nation's energy needs from renewable resources by 2025. Today, the figure is 11.1%, according to the Department of Energy. 
One purist is Myers, who worries that the government will industrialize the desert with acres of solar mirrors, trampling treasured landscapes. Groups such as the Natural 

Resources Defense Council (NRDC) counter that large, centralized projects are needed to speed the shift to non-polluting energy. 
"It's hard, because many of us have fought to protect the very lands" that could be affected, says Johanna Wald of the NRDC. 
Starting 'a new beginning' 
In a wood-paneled Washington conference room, under the words "America the Beautiful," Interior Secretary Ken Salazar says he runs "the real department of energy." 
After decades of allowing private companies to lease public lands for coal and oil, "we have started a new beginning" to make room for solar mirrors and wind turbines, he says. 

As with the older leases, operators would pay to use the land. 
Salazar has designated 24 tracts in six Western states as possible solar project sites. There is none on federal lands now. 
The Interior Department will open offices to eliminate a five-year backlog of applications. There are 158 pending solar projects on 1.8 million acres of public land. If all went 

through, they could power 29 million homes. 

Not all will be approved, Salazar says, because of environmental and other concerns. Still, the White House plans to streamline approval for at least 10 solar plants it hopes will create 50,000 jobs by 2011. Nearly half the solar proposals are in the Mojave Desert, home to the threatened desert tortoise, Indian petroglyphs and an intact stretch of Route 66, the historic highway 
dotted with vintage diners and derelict gas stations. 
Not far from the iconic Roy's Motel and Diner, PG&E consultant Scott Galati tells environmentalists that surveys reveal no rare plants or threatened species on a planned solar site. A nearby rail line and access road are proof, he says, the land is hardly pristine. Myers of the Wildlands Conservancy says an abandoned farm farther from Route 66 would be a better choice. PG&E's Harron says it is privately owned and would be difficult to 
acquire. 
The great advantage of government land, she says, is how much of it there is and the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of building projects on public property. 
Too easy, says Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. In a letter to Salazar last month, she said she was "deeply concerned" about a "bias under which solar developers believe they are more likely to receive a permit to build their projects on pristine public lands than on previously disturbed private lands." 
Myers fears taxpayers are subsidizing inappropriately large-scale projects. He'd prefer a focus on rooftop solar panels and other small-scale solutions in urban areas that would reduce the clout of big energy companies. 
Wald, the NRDC lawyer, says the government is taking a balanced approach. She spent 35 years battling the oil and gas industry and now is working with them to find appropriate sites for wind and solar plants. She agrees that energy self-sufficiency is important but says Myers' approach would take too long. "Even if (some environmentalists) don't like it," she says, large-scale projects "are going to happen." 
Monumental roadblock? 
Feinstein wants to establish a national monument that would bar energy development on hundreds of thousands of acres of desert between the Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park. The area includes former railroad land the Wild-lands Conservancy donated to the government a decade ago. 
If Congress establishes the monument, PG&E and 22 other companies would have to build someplace else. 
Across the border in Nevada, Feinstein's Democratic colleague Harry Reid is taking a different approach. The Senate majority leader supports a proposed wind turbine farm on federal land near Searchlight, his hometown. 
That has some of his neighbors livid. Many say they fled to the quiet desert town to get away from California's massive, densely packed wind farms. 
They fear the same in Searchlight, where the tallest structure is the 150-foot flagpole at Terrible's Casino. 
Duke Energy wants to put up 95 wind turbines with blades that reach 415 feet off the ground. Though few in number compared with older, less efficient wind farms -- some with thousands of turbines -- that's still too many for some people. 
"It's going to ruin our way of life," says Verlie Doing, 85, a friend of Reid's late mother. Doing owns the Nugget Casino. 
Twelve miles south in the Nevada town of Cal-Nev-Ari, retired energy company electrician Robert Carty supports the turbines. He sees "the global picture" of climate change and calls opponents "CAVE people -- citizens against virtually everything." 
Across the Mojave in Lucerne Valley, Calif., where neighbors are arguing over a proposed solar plant on 516 acres, county employee Andrew Silva sighs. 
"Folks in the East," he says, "don't necessarily recognize how complex and beautiful and diverse the desert is."

Abstract 
In June, the climate research program published a report that found average temperatures in the USA have increased more than 2 degrees in the past five decades, largely as the result of emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. 

Full Text 
The nation is headed for strong heat waves in coming decades that will hit cities and farmers and threaten wildlife with extinction, a new global warming report warns. 
The report, "More Extreme Heat Waves: Global Warming's Wake Up Call," sponsored by medical, environmental and civil rights organizations, comes as a legislative fight over a 

climate change bill gets ready to resume next month in Congress. Its remedies are based on recent findings of global warming effects by the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program, which coordinates climate research across federal agencies. 
"The report highlights the current vulnerabilities from heat waves growing," says climate scientist Amanda Staudt of the National Wildlife Federation, a report sponsor. Average 

temperatures are expected to grow 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit nationwide over the next century, according to the federal climate research group. 

The severity will vary with industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, but "heat waves will continue to get worse in the coming decades," the report warns. It lists the 30 major 
cities most at risk. 
In June, the climate research program published a report that found average temperatures in the USA have increased more than 2 degrees in the past five decades, largely as 

the result of emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the 

atmosphere, which drives up temperatures in the air and oceans. 
"Heat waves worsen not only direct effects like heat stroke but also heart disease, asthma and other respiratory problems," says Peter Wilk of Physicians for Social Responsibility 
in Washington, D.C., a report sponsor. The 1995 Chicago heat wave killed more than 500 people, and the 2003 European heat wave killed more than 35,000, he adds. 

"People in cities, the poor and often people of color, are the most vulnerable," says Benjamin Jealous, head of the NAACP, another report sponsor. "They are most likely to live in 

high-rise apartments, lack air conditioning and other resources. Climate change is a civil rights issue." 
Says environmental hazards expert Michael McGeehin of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which was not part of the report: "This report does a nice job of 
laying out the risks and steps we can take in the face of changing climate. Every heat death is preventable."

Abstract 
The American Clean Energy and Security Act, as its title implies, provides a path to cleaner energy before we choke our planet in toxic gases and provides for the development of current (coal), past (nuclear power) and future (wind, solar and yet to be discovered) alternative energy sources. The most comprehensive study to date by the nation's leading scientists, "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," makes the case that global warming is already affecting our water resources, coastal areas, forests, fish and wildlife and much more. 

Full Text 
Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot. 
Today: Congress' cap-and-trade bill. 
Cal: You and I have seen a lot of bizarre happenings in Washington. We have heard about members of Congress who vote on legislation they have not read, but the last-minute crafting of the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill that recently passed the House barely gave lawmakers time to catch a glimpse of -- let alone read -- legislation that aims to upend this nation's economy. Even Carol Browner, the president's "energy czar," admitted on Fox News that she hadn't read the entire bill. This gives new meaning to the term "faith-based initiative." 
Bob: Let's get real. There isn't a Republican or Democrat in Congress who reads any bill more than a few pages. I mean, if they're not going to read intelligence reports ahead of the Iraq war, what makes you think they'll read the mind-numbing details of this thing? The American Clean Energy and Security Act, as its title implies, provides a path to cleaner energy before we choke our planet in toxic gases and provides for the development of current (coal), past (nuclear power) and future (wind, solar and yet to be discovered) alternative energy sources. Cap and trade is only a portion of this bill, which ultimately aims to wean us off foreign oil, something you and I have long agreed was crucial for national security. 
Cal: In a past column, we have agreed on the need to explore new energy sources. You believe this will help stem global warming -- which I think is fiction -- and I ... 
Bob: I'm sorry, but I have to interrupt. Cal, at some point you have got to get out of the Flat Earth Society so many of you conservatives buy into. This ship has sailed, and by many estimates, it'll be sailing on higher seas at the rate we're going. The most comprehensive study to date by the nation's leading scientists, "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," makes the case that global warming is already affecting our water resources, coastal areas, forests, fish and wildlife and much more. Conservatives scream about leaving a huge federal debt for our children and grandchildren. How about worrying about leaving them a planet that is still habitable? Debt can be paid off. Climate change could be irreversible. 
Cal: Are you done? I can trot out my own scientists to shout down the global warming alarmists, but lest this piece become hand-to-hand combat on climate change, let's stick to the energy issue. As I was saying, I'm for reducing American dependence on oil from countries that use our money to fund terrorism and oppress their people. We are both in accord on that. But this cap-and-trade bill is a jobs-killer. It would raise taxes and, I think, actually increase our dependence on foreign oil because the cost to businesses would mean less domestic exploration. And before you say it, those so-called green jobs that the president promises will have to be subsidized by Washington, because government doesn't create technology people want to buy. That's what the private sector does, but the private sector won't be able to compete with big government. 
Bob: Or perhaps now that the largest economy in the world is finally getting behind the green movement, the private money will follow. It's worth noting that since March, clean-energy companies have seen their stocks boom, by far outpacing the rest of the equities market. The Wilderhill Clean Energy Index, comprised of 51 companies, is up 72% since early March. With apologies to Tina Turner, what's government got to do with it? 
Cal: Everything, in fact. Environmentalists have a true believer in the White House and compliant Democrats behind the purse strings in Congress. The president wants to change the light bulbs in the White House to more energy-efficient ones. Why not go back to candles? Where have I seen this approach before? It was Jimmy Carter who told the country to save energy by turning down the thermostat in winter -- and to wear sweaters, of course. Lyndon Johnson turned out the lights in the White House at night (and the outdoor floodlights) to save energy. That was all symbolism while real solutions were ignored. America is about doing, not doing without, and moving forward, not retreating. 
Bob: Technology is not the enemy, Cal. You conservatives are scraping the bottom of the barrel if you have to criticize this president for using energy-efficient light bulbs! But let me take a few of your less-than-informed comments which I'm sure come from the Chamber of Commerce and conservative think tanks. First, the bill would not raise taxes. The bill provides permits for the amount of greenhouse gases business can emit, and 85% of those permits will be given away. Because electric utilities are among the largest producers of greenhouse gases -- and thus will receive a large share of the free permits -- their rates won't take a dramatic hit. 
Cal: OK, so perhaps it's not an actual tax increase, but tell that to Americans who would have less cash in their pockets as a result. People would pay more for energy because of this. Period. We can argue about how much, but if the government estimates consumers would pay -- let's make a guess -- $200 more each year, how many people reading this column believe that'd be the real number. I see no hands going up out there, Bob. 
Bob: And how many of those same people would rather let the planet turn into a pressure cooker? Huh. I actually see a few hands, but again, it's your cohorts in the Flat Earth Society. 
Cal: It's not like we're groping around in the dark. Spain has tried cap and trade. It has created jobs, but most of them are temporary and require large government subsidies. And Spain's unemployment rate did not decrease but went up to its present 18.1%. Why would America try something that could cause great damage to our economy -- now, of all times? 
Bob: The European Union established a cap-and-trade system in 2005. After a difficult start, 15 of the European countries in the program have seen carbon emissions fall for four straight years. The EU-15 have slashed carbon emissions 5% below 1990 levels and are on pace to cut 11.3% by 2012. A recent review, by GHK Consulting, of European companies that were forced to put caps on emissions has found that "power plants have become more efficient, companies have invested in new fleets of (energy-efficient) cars." 
Cal: The bottom line for many Americans will be: How will cap and trade affect me? The Congressional Budget Office has come up with preliminary figures on the cost. Their guess: $175 a family per year. Critics smell a skunk. The Heritage Foundation, for instance, said the cost will be closer to $3,000 per family after one factors in the hit to the larger economy. I foresee gas and electric prices increasing as domestic energy production declines with no discernable improvement in the climate. 
Bob: I'll take the non-partisan CBO's word for it over the conservative Heritage folks anytime. 
Cal: So is there any common ground? 
Bob: Of course. We agree that nuclear power plant construction -- which was halted in the 1970s -- should resume quickly. New technologies in nuclear power will make the plants safe. We don't agree on global warming, but we do agree on moving the United States away from dependence on foreign oil. The increase in alternative energy research and development in this bill would provide homegrown energy sources -- from solar to wind to new electric batteries for powering cars, to clean coal technology and drilling for abundant natural gas. Surely we can find common ground on those things. Besides, the Senate this week was beginning to take its turn with this legislation. Let's see what the sausage-grinder produces. 
Cal: That's a start. I wish we could start with these rather than the oppressive hand of government, but I'll join you in homegrown energy, including nuclear. And as for the Senate, perhaps we'll get a better piece of legislation. But my guess is that the sausage won't be palatable to the American people or economy -- and the last thing we need right now is decades of indigestion.

Abstract 
The donations cover various activities -- from a golf tournament that raises money for a lawmaker's non-profit to gifts to the alma mater of a powerful House committee chairman. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 6/12/2009: Joe Baca Jr., son of Rep. Joe Baca, D-Calif., is president of the Joe Baca Foundation. A chart in Monday's editions misidentified the foundation official. 
WASHINGTON -- On a mild evening last September, Citigroup lobbyists mingled with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn at a rooftop reception -- complete with miniature putting greens -- as the company hosted a party to honor the third most powerful Democrat in the House and raise money for one of his favorite golf charities. 
Health insurers and hospitals, meanwhile, are donating millions to help build an institute in Boston to celebrate the career of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is attempting to overhaul the nation's health care system. 
Despite a ban on gifts to lawmakers and limits on campaign contributions, lobbyists and groups that employ them can spend unlimited money to honor members of Congress or donate to non-profits connected to them or their relatives. The public -- until now -- had little insight into the scope of this largely hidden world of special-interest influence. 
Under ethics rules passed in 2007, lobbyists for the first time last year had to report any payment made for an event or to a group connected to a lawmaker and other top federal officials. 
USA TODAY undertook the first comprehensive analysis of the lobbying reports and found 2,759 payments, totaling $35.8 million, were made in 2008. The money went to honor 534 current and former lawmakers, almost 250 other federal officials and more than 100 groups, many of which count lawmakers among their members. The total cost is roughly equivalent to what the U.S. government spends to operate Yellowstone National Park each year. 
Most of the money -- about $28 million -- went to non-profit groups, some with direct ties to members of Congress. In two cases, USA TODAY found, the donations to non­profits associated with a member of Congress came in response to a personal appeal for funds from the lawmaker. 
"It's another example of the many pockets of a politician's coat," says Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation, a watchdog group. The spending amounts to an "end-run" around campaign-finance laws "that are designed to limit the appearance of undue influence," she says. 
The money came from companies, trade associations and labor groups that lobby Congress and the government on a range of issues, from seeking a share of last year's $700 billion financial bailout package to trying to shape the debate on climate change. 
The donations cover various activities -- from a golf tournament that raises money for a lawmaker's non-profit to gifts to the alma mater of a powerful House committee chairman. 
"You can still have a gala or something or the other for a charity and earn some favor with members of Congress, which is what the gift ban was put in place to avoid," says Dan Danner, CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business and a veteran Washington lobbyist. 
The spending demonstrates the subtle ways that special-interest groups try to sway lawmakers, without making "something as crass as a payoff," says Kenneth Gross, a former Federal Election Commission official. 
He credits Congress for mandating the disclosure of the gifts and giving the public another view of the relationships between lobbyists and lawmakers. 
Invitation to access 
The lobbying reports were required by Congress after former lobbyist Jack Abramoff admitted in 2006 that he provided gifts, including a luxury golf trip to Scotland, to then-representative Bob Ney and others in exchange for favors. It is illegal to provide gifts to federal authorities in exchange for official actions, and both Abramoff and Ney, an Ohio Republican, went to prison. 
What is more common -- and legal -- are donations such as the $40,000 AT&T gave in December to the Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, which researches Alzheimer's. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., founded the non-profit, which is named for his late mother, and he is the honorary chairman of its board. 
These are "not run-of-the-mill charities," says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group. "These gifts are another way to gain influence with lawmakers." 
Last year, the telecommunication industry gave more than $72,000 to non-profits and charities in honor of Rockefeller, who advocated legislation to provide legal immunity to phone companies that participated in the government's anti-terrorism eavesdropping program. The largest donation came from AT&T. At the time, Rockefeller chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee and helped broker a deal on the bill, which passed last year. 
Rockefeller oversees the telecom industry as chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. 
Claudia Jones, an AT&T spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
Interviews show the West Virginia Democrat made a direct appeal to another company for a donation to the institute. Consol Energy gave $25,000 to the institute in October 

after Rockefeller sent a fundraising letter to CEO J. Brett Harvey, says Thomas Hoffman, Consol's senior vice president. The company operates coal mines in West Virginia. 
"It would be foolish to think we don't take note of the fact when a member of Congress says, 'Hey, I think this is something you ought to support,' " Hoffman says. 
Rockefeller spokeswoman Jamie Smith declined to discuss the solicitation but says there is no connection between the gifts and the senator's official actions. 
"If some in Washington think giving to a cause Jay Rockefeller cares about will affect his policy views, they surely don't know him," she said in an e-mail. "His policies are based 

on the merits of an issue and on what's good for West Virginia and the country -- period." 

Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, the top Republican on the House energy committee, asked an energy company to donate to a foundation that bears his name. His daughter-in-law, 
Amy Barton, is the unpaid director. 
Utility giant Exelon gave $25,000 to the non-profit last June and $50,000 in 2006, according to federal records and interviews with company officials. 
Barton wrote to Exelon CEO John Rowe, seeking the money, says David Brown, Exelon's top lobbyist. The company is one of the nation's largest producers of nuclear energy. 

Barton has long advocated on the industry's behalf, pushing for the opening of a nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain, outside Las Vegas. 
Barton said he did nothing inappropriate. "There's no personal benefit," he said in an interview. "The money doesn't go to me." 
He said he was "very proud" of the foundation's work. The foundation, which funds non-profit groups in his congressional district, donated $375,000 for a $1.2 million Boys & 

Girls Club in Corsicana, Texas, says Sylvia Waters, a club director. "The bottom line is that there wouldn't be a Boys & Girls Club in Corsicana today if it wasn't for the Joe Barton Family Foundation," Barton said. 
Lobbyist ties remain Despite a pledge by congressional leaders to sever ties between lawmakers and special interests, the reports show lobbyists often give to non-profits associated with the lawmakers who regulate their industries. 
Health care groups, for instance, give millions to the planned Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston. Pharmaceutical giant Amgen wrote the biggest check -- $5 million in December -- to the institute, which will honor Kennedy's more than four decades in Congress and promote the study of the U.S. Senate. 
Aetna insurance company donated $50,000. 
Kennedy, who is battling brain cancer, chairs the Senate's health and education committee and is at work on comprehensive health care legislation. Aetna has engaged in 
private talks with Kennedy aides on the bill, Aetna spokesman Mohit Ghose says. 

Ghose says the donation was unrelated to those negotiations and instead "advances our goal of continuing to take a leadership role in public policy." 

Kelley Davenport, a spokeswoman for Amgen, says the donation reflected the company's interest in lauding Kennedy's long career and in helping "young people to become 
engaged in public service and public policy." 
Kennedy, the records show, was the most honored member of Congress, with a total of nearly $6 million. Most of the money went to the Kennedy institute. 
Kennedy spokeswoman Melissa Wagoner and institute trustee Paul Kirk say the Democratic senator has steered clear of potential conflicts of interest with his official duties by 

not soliciting donations. In total, the organization has collected more than $20 million, according to a January institute news release. 
"The principal reason fundraising is going so well is that there is an enormous outpouring of appreciation for Sen. Kennedy's public service," Kirk says. 
Amgen spent the most in honor of members of Congress last year, the analysis found. It was among 20 corporations and unions responsible for $17.6 million -- or nearly half -­
of the spending in honor of lawmakers and federal officials last year, the USA TODAY analysis shows. Those groups spent a total of $137.5 million to lobby Congress and federal agencies last year. 
Amgen also donated to the Frontier Foundation in honor of Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., who is on the House panel that regulates the drug industry. 
The foundation, which provides college scholarships and once was headed by Buyer's daughter, received $385,000 in donations from pharmaceutical companies from 2005 
through 2007, according to its IRS filings. 

Buyer, who has worked on health policy in Congress for years, helped kill a provision in 2007 opposed by drug companies and broadcasters that would have imposed a three-year ban on advertising new drugs, congressional records show. Consumer advocates, including the Consumers Union, pushed the measure, arguing that aggressive drug pitches unduly sway patients to seek treatment from drugs before their safety records have been established. 
During debate by a commerce subcommittee, Buyer co-sponsored an amendment that stripped the advertising ban from a larger bill overhauling the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
In an interview, Buyer says "there is no connection" between his legislative actions and donations to the foundation. "I'm not an officer. I'm not a board director," he says of his 
role in the non-profit. "Do I help the foundation? Yes, I do. Do I help other charity groups? Yes, I do." 

He referred other questions to foundation officials. 

The charity's IRS filing covering the year 2007, the most recent available, listed Buyer's daughter, Colleen, as its unpaid president. Stephanie Mattix, listed as the group's paid 
secretary/treasurer, is executive director of Buyer's political action committee, Storm Chasers, according to Federal Election Commission filings. 
Mattix and Buyer told USA TODAY that Colleen Buyer had left the group and referred questions to its president, Brenda Olthoff. Olthoff did not respond to e-mails and calls. 

Colleen Buyer did not return telephone calls. 

The National Association of Broadcasters contributed $25,000 in honor of Buyer to the foundation last year. Amgen donated $15,000. 
"I don't think there is a link between a specific vote on drug legislation and contributing to kids going to college in Indiana," says Dennis Wharton, the broadcasters' executive vice president. "We look at where we think it's a worthy cause." 
Davenport, Amgen's spokeswoman, says the gift matched the company's "philanthropic mission to improve education." 
'Putting and politics' 
The donations are a path for lobbyists and company executives to mingle in more intimate surroundings with lawmakers during weekend golf outings and invitation-only dinners. 
Last year, lobbyists and the companies that employ them gave more than $802,000 to non-profit groups in honor of Rep. Clyburn, the USA TODAY analysis shows. Those non­profits included the James E. Clyburn Research and Scholarship Foundation and the First Tee of Washington, D.C., which introduces minority and low-income children to golf. 
It was First Tee that benefited from a "Putting and Politics" reception for Clyburn and Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., on the rooftop of Citigroup's Washington offices in September. The company has received $45 billion in federal bailout money. 
Nick Calio, Citigroup's top lobbyist, attended the reception but declined to comment. Gretchen Hamm, the non-profit's executive director, says Citigroup has donated $75,000 over the past three years. 
Clyburn, an avid golfer, is a longtime supporter of First Tee. Two years ago, he inserted $3 million into a spending bill to expand the national program at Defense Department facilities. "Why shouldn't children of military families have access to this program as well?" Clyburn spokeswoman Kristie Greco asks. 
Each year, Clyburn presides over a golf tournament that raises money for the scholarship program that bears his name. The former schoolteacher created the charity more than 20 years ago to "help deserving students afford a college education" Greco says. It is managed by an independent board and "Congressman Clyburn does not solicit donations," she adds. 
But top executives and lobbyists from companies that contribute to the charity can join Clyburn for two days of golfing in South Carolina. Participants have included executives from Duke Energy and Dell, which donated more than $115,000 worth of computer equipment to students in Clyburn's program last year. 
"It's not unusual that our folks in government affairs would play golf with members of Congress and support these causes," says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, which gave $5,000 to Clyburn's foundation last year. "It's part of the political process, and it's well within the law."

Abstract 
Most recently: *Chevy Chase headlined this year's Earth Day festival on the National Mall in Washington. *Leonardo DiCaprio met with President Obama that week to discuss environmental issues. *Robert Redford held a news conference with members of Congress in December, urging the Interior Department not to lease land in Utah for oil and gas drilling. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Britain's Prince Charles, who launched a campaign to save the rainforest in late 2007, has enlisted Harrison Ford, Robin Williams and soccer legend Pele to 
advance his cause in a video. 
Charles unveiled his video Tuesday on MySpace and other social networking sites in an attempt to get "diverse communities to come together." 
Celebrities have long made their way to Washington to champion environmental issues. Most recently: 
*Chevy Chase headlined this year's Earth Day festival on the National Mall in Washington. 
*Leonardo DiCaprio met with President Obama that week to discuss environmental issues. 

*Robert Redford held a news conference with members of Congress in December, urging the Interior Department not to lease land in Utah for oil and gas drilling. 
Celebrities "have a bigger megaphone than we would ever have or ever be able to buy," says Julia Bovey, spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which 
counts DiCaprio, Redford and James Taylor among its trustees. "When we have celebrities ... talk about what we do and why it matters, we're able to reach hundreds of 
thousands, or even millions." 

Stars can even sway lawmakers to hold a hearing on an issue that may have otherwise never occurred, Bovey says. And stars say they hear stories through their travels that 

they can relay to policymakers. 
"It obviously brings a spotlight to a cause, but the spotlight will quickly go away if you don't walk the walk," says actor Matthew Modine, who spoke at the Earth Day event on 
April 19 about his charity Bicycle for a Day, which encourages people to improve the environment and their health. "If you don't practice what you preach, people will turn their 
backs from you immediately." 

Actress Ashley Judd testified before a House panel April 23, urging lawmakers to spend an additional $7 billion to help pay for damage to ecosystems and wildlife caused by 

climate change. 
"I understand that I have the opportunity to be seen and heard in perhaps a way that a more anonymous citizen does not," says Judd, who went to the Hill on behalf of 
Defenders of Wildlife. "I'm trusted with people's stories ... and I consider it a holy quest to take those stories to speak truth to power about these people's lives." 

Judd isn't the only boldface name in recent years who has testified on Capitol Hill on various environmental issues. 

Fight Club actor Edward Norton appeared before a House committee last May on making green homes for low-income families a priority. Brothers & Sisters star Rob Lowe 
testified in July 2007 about the potential of plug-in hybrid cars. 
Celebrities can be a mixed blessing, says Marc Morano, who runs climatedepot.com, a website with a skeptical view of global warming. 
A celebrity speaker "gives you an instant VIP speaker even though the speaker has no expertise on the subject matter," Morano says. "There's a real risk because it looks a bit 

vacuous." 
At worst, a celebrity spokesperson, he says, "just comes across as very uninformed ... a cheap publicity stunt." 
Meanwhile, the hand-over of power in Washington may attract more celebrities here to press their pet causes. 
Modine calls the new administration and its stances on the environment an "opportunity to move forward." Judd, who campaigned for Obama, also praises the new leadership 

but says she'll nevertheless press the administration on mountaintop coal mining. 
"Like most of America, many (celebrities) were quite swept up that we can change things," Bovey says. "That makes Washington an exciting, appealing place."

Abstract 
[...] a number of USCAP recommendations are now part of the draft bill: *Companies could buy offsets by investing in reforestation or renewable energy that could be used to meet emission targets. *Carbon polluters could "bank," or save allowances for use in future years. * The Environmental Protection Agency would create a reserve of allowances that would be made available if the price of the permits rose to "unexpectedly high levels" under the system known as cap and trade.

WASHINGTON -- After fighting each other for decades, environmentalists and industrial businesses are working together in Congress to clear the air -- literally -- through a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. 
While hundreds of groups are lobbying Congress on proposed climate change legislation, the 2-year-old U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) -- which has put rivals General Electric and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) on the same page -- is having more influence than most. 
Draft legislation that Democrats hope to advance next month is "modeled closely" on the recommendations of the group, according to a summary of the measure provided by its authors. USCAP was repeatedly touted by lawmakers in hearings on the legislation last week. 
"It's a remarkable dynamic," said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., a member of the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. "It is not lost on members of Congress that you have this coalition that touches all points of the economy." 
Thirty companies and non-profit organizations belong to the coalition, including Dow Chemical, Duke Energy, the Nature Conservancy and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Members say a united front by disparate groups will be key to approving energy policy -- particularly in the Senate, where 60 votes likely will be needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and win passage. 
"We have to construct a system that makes sense not just environmentally but economically," said Steve Cochran, director of the climate campaign for the Environmental Defense Fund, a USCAP member. "Doing it 'with these companies' rather than 'to these companies' makes some sense." 
Under the bill, the government would impose a limit on emissions -- the proposal calls for a 20% reduction from 2005 levels by 2020. Companies that exceed their pollution limit may purchase credits, or "allowances," from other companies that cut emissions by more than required. 
Over time, the cap is reduced, and companies must decide whether to invest in technology to cut emissions, purchase more power from renewable sources or buy additional allowances. Both sides get something: environmentalists, a defined cap on emissions; companies, a smooth transition and more certainty. 
"We are in that group shoulder to shoulder with several of the country's leading environmental groups," said Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Brian Hertzog. "There's a lot of similarities between what we're looking to advance and what that community is looking for." 
Significant questions remain, such as whether the government will initially distribute the allowances to companies for free, auction them off or do a combination of both. Also unresolved is how revenue collected by the government for the allowances would be spent. Even so, a number of USCAP recommendations are now part of the draft bill: 
*Companies could buy offsets by investing in reforestation or renewable energy that could be used to meet emission targets. 
*Carbon polluters could "bank," or save allowances for use in future years. 
* The Environmental Protection Agency would create a reserve of allowances that would be made available if the price of the permits rose to "unexpectedly high levels" under the system known as cap and trade. 
USCAP members argue the proposal must not result in a sudden spike in costs. The EPA estimates that an average household would pay an extra $98 to $140 annually for energy under the cap-and-trade system, but some Republicans say the price tag could be significantly higher. 
"Ultimately, it's the end user that is going to pay for this," said Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, an energy subcommittee member who said the companies involved with USCAP have had a "mixed" impact on the debate. "Those companies will simply be passing along those higher costs." 
USCAP may help sway moderate members of the House panel, said John Coequyt, a global-warming legislative expert with the Sierra Club, which is not a coalition member. Coequyt, who described the environmentalists in USCAP as "taking one for the team," predicted the effort will be more difficult in the Senate. 
The Sierra Club has not taken an official position on the draft bill. Though the group supports many of its provisions, including the timeline for cutting emissions, it would prefer stricter limitations on new coal plants, spokesman Josh Dorner said. 
"They negotiated a reasonably tough deal with the other groups in USCAP, and they brought it forward at a pretty tough time," Coequyt said. "On the other hand, the environmental groups probably signed up for something that they might not have been willing to sign up for if they were saying what they really felt."

Abstract

Full Text 
The worldwide economic slowdown is having an unexpected positive impact in the fight against global warming: Emissions of carbon dioxide are falling, records collected by governments show. 
From the United States to Europe to China, the global economic crisis has forced offices to close and factories to cut back. That means less use of fossil fuels such as coal to make energy. Fossil-fuel burning, which creates carbon dioxide, is the primary human contributor to global warming. 
A recession-driven drop in emissions "is good for the environment," says Emilie Mazzacurati of Point Carbon, an energy research company. "In the long term, that's not how we want to reduce emissions." 
As carbon dioxide builds in the atmosphere, it traps heat and warms the Earth. The result: melting glaciers, rising seas and fiercer droughts. 
The lower emissions are caused partly by milder weather -- which means less energy is needed for cooling and heating -- and by policies that promote energy efficiency, but experts agree that economic problems play a role. 
The emission decreases are unusual and in some cases unprecedented: 
*Carbon dioxide from U.S. power plants fell roughly 3% from 2007 to 2008, according to preliminary data from the Environmental Protection Agency analyzed by the Environmental Integrity Project. That's the biggest drop since 1995-96, the first two consecutive years for which data are publicly available. 
*Carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in 27 European nations in 2008 plummeted 6%, according to Point Carbon's analysis of data published last week by the European Commission. 
*Electricity production by Chinese power plants has fallen almost every month since September compared with the same months a year earlier, says Richard Morse, a Stanford University researcher. A drop in power generation translates to a drop in carbon-dioxide output. These are the first such drops in Chinese power production since the Chinese economic boom in the 1990s. 
European nations face a 2012 deadline to cut their emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, a global-warming treaty. The recession could make it easier for countries to meet their goals, says David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, but "I wouldn't recommend recession as a way to deal with this problem." 
Some experts fear lower emissions may make companies and governments less likely to spend money to cut carbon output. "There's a risk that it will push back needed investment into ... cleaner production," Mazzacurati says.

Nuclear inches back into energy spotlight: Utilities revive reactor plans

Abstract 
Unlike power plants fueled by coal and even cleaner natural gas, nuclear reactors emit none of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. Obama strongly favors capping global-warming emissions from fossil fuel plants, which would boost nuclear's prospects. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 3/31/2009: A map in Monday's editions incorrectly stated that license applications for new nuclear reactors have been filed for Hammett, Idaho; Blue Castle, Utah; Amarillo, Texas; and South Florida. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says applications are expected to be filed for those areas. The map also should have made clear that it displayed the percentage of power generated by nuclear reactors in each state. 
The nation's nuclear power industry -- stuck in a decades-long deep freeze -- is thawing. 
Utilities are poised to build a new generation of nuclear plants 30 years after the Three Mile Island accident, whose anniversary was Saturday, halted new reactor applications. The momentum is being driven by growing public acceptance of relatively clean nuclear energy to combat global warming. 
Several companies have taken significant steps that will likely lead to completion of four reactors by 2015 to 2018 and up to eight by 2020. All would be built next to existing nuclear plants. 
Southern Co. says it will begin digging an 86-foot-deep crater this June in Vogtle, Ga., to make way for two reactors after recently winning state approval, though it won't pour concrete until it gets a federal license, likely in 2011. At least five power companies have signed contracts with equipment vendors. And Florida and South Carolina residents this year began paying new utility fees to finance planned reactors. 
The steps signal that a nuclear renaissance anticipated for several years is finally taking shape. Seventeen companies have sought U.S. federal approval for 26 reactors since late 2007. All have enhanced safety features. 
"The resurgence of nuclear energy is underway," says Steve Kerekes of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group. 
Whether it will yield a flood of new reactors or a trickle will largely depend on the success -- or failure -- of the initial wave. 
Nuclear a 'better option' now? 
The industry believes it can avoid the billions in cost overruns and years of delays that marred nuclear construction in the 1970s and 1980s. Licensing has been streamlined. Utilities are seeking firmer costs and schedules. And designs are more detailed. 
Still, some hurdles are emerging. Some companies are submitting incomplete applications or seeking design changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), possibly delaying approval. At least two utilities recently said they're switching to different reactor models because they couldn't receive assurances on costs and the timetable. And since several models are new, problems could emerge as they're built in the USA for the first time. The type of reactor planned for Maryland is being built in Finland, where it's three years behind schedule and $2 billion over budget. 
"We're talking about a new generation of technology," says John Reed, CEO of Concentric Energy Advisors. "You have to demonstrate to (lenders) that you can make money with these." 
Nuclear plants are hugely expensive, and the credit crisis has all but sealed lenders' wallets. The success of the resurgence also hinges on companies' ability to obtain financing. 
Nuclear officials are taking comfort in some encouraging signals from the Obama administration. During his campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama seemed cool to nuclear energy, saying waste storage concerns must be solved before the nation builds new plants. Although the new administration has said Yucca Mountain northwest of Las Vegas is no longer a storage option for the waste, Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Congress this month that nuclear "has to be" part of "our energy future." Waste, he said, can be stored at reactor sites "for decades." 
Unlike power plants fueled by coal and even cleaner natural gas, nuclear reactors emit none of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. Obama strongly favors capping global-warming emissions from fossil fuel plants, which would boost nuclear's prospects. Renewable energy is popular but intermittent. 
Today, 104 reactors supply 20% of the nation's electricity. Just to hold that share, all 26 proposed reactors would have to be completed by 2030. And to meet global-warming goals, 42 reactors should be built the next two decades, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Reed says that's possible if the first wave goes well. A new Gallup Poll shows a record 59% of Americans favor nuclear energy. 
Here's the rub: Nuclear reactor costs have doubled in the past three years to as much as about $8 billion, Moody's Investors Service says. They're twice as expensive as coal-fired plants and triple the cost of natural-gas plants. Reactors also are far more complex, taking up to 10 years to license and build vs. a couple of years for gas-fired plants. 
Yet, nuclear plants are far less costly to operate, and the fuel, uranium, is cheaper than coal and natural gas. South Carolina Electric & Gas chose nuclear instead of natural gas to meet some of its power needs because it could produce electricity at retail rates of about 8 cents a kilowatt hour vs. about 10 cents with gas. That's after figuring in subsidies such as production tax credits and before adding potential fees on gas plants for emitting CO{-2}. 
"Nuclear came out to be a better option," says Stephen Byrne, nuclear chief for SCE&G, which plans two reactors near Columbia, S.C. "The cost of natural gas fluctuates pretty wildly." 
Trying to avoid past mistakes 
The industry is recovering from a harrowing past. After the Three Mile Island accident in central Pennsylvania -- which led to no deaths or known injuries, but caused a small radiation leak from the plant -- the NRC passed sweeping new safety rules. Inspectors forced utilities to rip out pipes and install back-up pumps or generators midconstruction. Since utilities didn't submit designs before building, each reactor was custom built, further burdening the NRC. 
Companies built plants so quickly to meet rising power demand that blueprints were only about 20% complete when construction began. Contractors redid work on the fly, causing delays. Double-digit interest rates drove up already swollen costs. 
Compounding the problem: The NRC first issued a license to build a reactor, then a separate license to operate it. Utilities that completed plants had to wait for an operating license before they could sell electricity and recoup their investments. 
Nationwide, state regulators denied utilities' petitions to recover $18 billion in cost overruns. Some went bankrupt. 
Under new rules, power companies can apply for one license to both build and operate a nuclear reactor, streamlining the review. Designs must be approved separately before construction begins. And power companies are using just five blueprints. Regulators hope they'll churn out cookie-cutter versions of each design. Yet, even as they seek licenses, only two of the five designs have been certified. 
"They're putting the cart before the horse," NRC Commissioner Gregory Jaczko says. "They should get the design done" before applying for a license. Also, he says, some reactor makers are proposing extensive modifications to their designs. Westinghouse, for instance, wants to make about 100 changes to its AP1000 reactor, says Vice President Ed Cummins. He says they're largely minor. 
Other key challenges: 
*On time, within budget. To avoid cost overruns, power companies want to lock in prices and put the onus on equipment vendors to pay added fees if a project is delayed. Vendors are reluctant to set prices because the reactors lack a track record, and it's impossible to predict the cost of labor and materials when construction starts in a few years. 
NRG, an independent power producer that's building two reactors in Texas, has signed a contract with Toshiba that nails down most costs, says Steven Winn, CEO of the NRG unit building the plant. That's possible, he says, because Toshiba owns 12% of the venture and has already built four of the same model units, called an ABWR, in Japan. 
Others are having mixed success at locking in terms. Exelon, for instance, recently said it was no longer going to use a General Electric Hitachi reactor because GE couldn't sufficiently guarantee fixed prices and a firm schedule. "We have to be careful and pragmatic" about risks, says GE Vice President Danny Roderick. 
*Elusive financing. With lenders hesitant to take chances on nuclear energy, 10 companies seek a total of $93 billion in federal loan guarantees for new nuclear plants. But only $18.5 billion is available -- enough to finance three or four projects. 
NEI President Marvin Fertel told Congress this month that independent power producers would likely abandon projects if the entire $93 billion is not funded, slowing the nuclear revival. 
Bill Wicker, spokesman for the Senate Energy committee, says guarantees are meant to bankroll only the maiden versions of new models. No more than another $18 billion is likely to be funded, he says. "It's not like a bottomless cup of coffee." 
Loan guarantees are less critical for regulated utilities, such as Southern and SCE&G, that have state clearances to recover some of their costs from ratepayers before construction is completed. In Florida, Progress Energy customers began paying an extra $14.53 a month in January to finance two reactors. Missouri is among states considering such cost-recovery legislation, but lawmakers are divided. Ameren says it won't build a new reactor without it. "You'd get laughed off Wall Street," says Senior Vice President Richard Mark. 
*Avoiding construction snafus. Manufacturers are trying to avoid the missteps of the first construction era. Three-dimensional computer images tell engineers precisely where pipes should go. GE and Westinghouse say 70% to 80% of their designs will be done before they break ground. And makers are increasingly building modular parts in the factory, cutting costs and minimizing mistakes on site. Westinghouse says 30% of its AP1000 reactor is modular. 
Still, "When you're building (a new model) for the first time, yes, there's risk," says Jone-Lin Wang of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The delays and cost overruns plaguing Areva's EPR unit in Finland were partly related to concrete that failed inspection. "We're quite confident we're learning from" the Finnish experience, says Michael Wallace, chairman of UniStar, the Constellation Energy unit building an EPR in Lusby, Md. 
*Tight supplies. Only one company, Japan Steel Works, builds the 600-ton steel forgings used to make reactor vessels. It can make only five or six a year. Southern, SCE&G, NRG and Constellation have spent tens of millions of dollars reserving such items. Those building reactors after the front-runners could face bottlenecks, Standard & Poor's says. But Japan Steel Works has said it's expanding its capacity by about a third, while others are entering the market. In the U.S., factories to make nuclear parts are being built in Virginia, Louisiana, Indiana and Tennessee. 
*Fewer workers. New reactors are likely to strain a pool of nuclear workers depleted by the construction hiatus. About 100,000 new workers would be needed to build and staff the 26 proposed reactors. Meantime, 35% of the current workforce is eligible to retire in five years. 
The NEI notes utilities have teamed with community colleges to train workers. Still, a likely shortage of specialized workers, such as nuclear welders, could drive up wages and construction costs, says consultant Steve Rus of Black & Veatch. 
Overall, Reed says the risk of delays and cost overruns is "far less" now. Yet, some companies are waiting before deciding to build. In Texas, Luminant says it will monitor the status of natural gas prices and carbon caps. Ameren wants to see if the first plants are successful. That's why the utility didn't want "to be in that first wave of plants," says Ameren nuclear executive Scott Bond.

Abstract 
Last year, the EPA changed its air quality standards for ground-level ozone from an average of 84 parts per billion to 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period, although the agency's scientific advisers had urged an even tougher standard of 60 to 70 parts per billion. 

Full Text 
For the first time, a large study shows the deadly effects of chronic exposure to ozone, one of the most widespread pollutants in the world and a key component of smog. The 
study appears in today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
Doctors have long known that ground-level ozone -- which is formed when sunlight interacts with pollution from tailpipes and coal-burning power plants -- can make asthma 
worse. This study, which followed nearly 450,000 Americans in 96 metropolitan areas for two decades, also shows that ozone increases deaths from respiratory diseases. 

This ground-level ozone has very different effects than the ozone layer high above the Earth, which helps filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation, says lead author Michael Jerrett, 

an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California-Berkeley. 
Although Jerrett found there was no safe level of ground-level ozone, some cities fare worse than others. People in Riverside, Calif., the highest ozone city, were 32% more 
likely to die in a given year of respiratory diseases compared with people in San Francisco, the city with lowest average annual ozone concentrations. 

Ozone pollution likely translates into thousands of additional deaths every year across the USA, Jerrett says. About 240,000 Americans a year die of respiratory illnesses. 
Controlling ozone -- one of the main greenhouse gases involved in global warming -- may both save lives and fight global climate change, Jerrett says. 
The study shows yet another way that air pollution can harm public health, says Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of national policy and advocacy for the American Lung 

Association. 

"It doesn't have to be a peak ozone day to be a problem," says Nolen, who wasn't involved with the new study. "If you're breathing it day in and day out over a longer period of 
time, the risk of premature death increases." 
The study also suggests the Environmental Protection Agency may need to reconsider its safety standard for ozone, Nolen says. Instead of looking at just the effect of being 

exposed to peak ozone levels, the agency may need to look at long-term exposure to lower levels of the gas. 

Last year, the EPA changed its air quality standards for ground-level ozone from an average of 84 parts per billion to 75 parts per billion over an eight-hour period, although the 
agency's scientific advisers had urged an even tougher standard of 60 to 70 parts per billion. 
One in three Americans lives in a city that's in violation of the EPA's current ozone standard, Jerrett says. 
President Obama's new EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, told USA TODAY last month that the agency should reconsider the ozone standard. "We need to go back to the basics here: 

science and the law," she said.

Abstract 
Presumably, someone making $180,000 a year has more discretionary income above the survival line than someone making $30,000 and thus is better able to withstand the pay cut. [...] a more equitable way to spread the pain would be to establish a minimum salary/income floor below which there will be no pay cuts, and above which there will be a sliding scale of reductions.

Concerning USA TODAY's article "Companies rethink coal plants," global warming is greatly exaggerated (News, Monday). 
The claim that scientists agree global warming is caused by human activity is simply untrue. 
The earth's climate is in a warming trend and carbon-dioxide levels are increasing, but there is no convincing evidence that one causes the other. 
There is also little argument that people are causing an increase in carbon dioxide. But the concentration of this trace gas makes up only 0.03% of the atmosphere. 
It is impossible for such trace amounts of any gas at these levels to affect world climate to the extent that we have been led to believe. 
This politically inspired and very poor science is now beginning to limit the construction of badly needed coal-fired power plants. 
It is imperative that the issue receives realistic scientific debate before further draining our economic and energy resources for no real gain.

Reprimand Holder 
Attorney General Eric Holder's assertion that the USA is a "nation of cowards" on matters of race should be rejected far more forcefully than it has been ("America is 'nation of 

cowards' on racial matters, Holder says," News, Feb. 19). 
Congress should attempt to remove or at least reprimand Holder for his statements. 
As attorney general, he should not use his position as a bully pulpit. 
I'm a Detroit resident. I think Holder should listen to a few of our city council meetings to see the sort of bile he is encouraging. 
People are using the cover of being an oppressed race to get away with the very thing they claim to want to change.

Adjust amount of pay cut based on employee income 
USA TODAY's article showcasing how companies turn to furloughs does a service by highlighting the benefits of keeping employees on board ("More companies turn to furloughs 

to save money, jobs," Cover story, Money, Thursday). 
But furloughs cut pay for each employee in the company by the same percentage, thus squeezing those at the bottom of the food chain harder than those at the top. 
Presumably, someone making $180,000 a year has more discretionary income above the survival line than someone making $30,000 and thus is better able to withstand the 

pay cut. 

Therefore a more equitable way to spread the pain would be to establish a minimum salary/income floor below which there will be no pay cuts, and above which there will be a sliding scale of reductions. The floor income and percentage of cuts in pay would vary with each company. But all employees would continue to work, although some may have reduced hours, and 
companies would be better prepared to spring back when the economy recovers. 
This plan might also lift the country's morale during a difficult era of shared sacrifice.

Downsizing government 
It is common for large corporations to hire efficiency firms to study their organizations and make recommendations on how to reorganize and downsize to eliminate duplication 

of effort, waste and abuse in order to gain better efficiency and profitability. 

The federal government is, in effect, the largest corporation in this country. I think it's time for the government to hire an efficiency firm to figure out where it can be downsized 
to eliminate the same problems that private firms might be facing.

Abstract 
The company cited "increasing environmental, legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding regulation of future greenhouse gas emissions" as part of the reason. *Last month, NV Energy announced it would delay the construction of a coal-burning power plant in eastern Nevada until it can install "clean coal" technology to bury the plant's carbon dioxide. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Even as demand for electricity rises, energy companies are delaying or scrapping plans for new coal-burning power plants because of the prospect of restrictions imposed by federal global warming legislation. 
Power use in the USA could grow 22% during the next 20 years, according to the Energy Department. To help keep the nation's laptops and TVs humming, dozens of new plants that burn coal -- by far the nation's largest source of electricity -- were in the works. 
President Obama and many members of Congress vow to cut U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the major "greenhouse gas" from industrial sources warming the Earth. Coal-burning power plants are the USA's single largest source of carbon dioxide. 
Proposed coal plants around the nation face difficulties: 
*Thursday, Alliant Energy dropped plans to build a coal-burning plant in central Iowa that would have been big enough to power nearly half a million homes and businesses. The company cited "increasing environmental, legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding regulation of future greenhouse gas emissions" as part of the reason. 
*Last month, NV Energy announced it would delay the construction of a coal-burning power plant in eastern Nevada until it can install "clean coal" technology to bury the plant's carbon dioxide. Such technology won't be widely available for a decade or more. "While uncertainty exists," NV Energy's Roberto Denis said of federal regulation, "we basically are standing still." 
*Last month, Southern Montana Electric Generation & Transmission Cooperative halted work on a coal-burning power plant near Great Falls, Mont. Instead it will build wind turbines and a plant that burns natural gas, even though the combination will not make as much power as the coal plant would have. 
*Also last month, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, ordered state regulators not to approve new coal-fired plants until "all feasible and prudent alternatives" had been considered. Five plants are planned. The state attorney general and Republican legislators are challenging Granholm's directive. 
*In December, Peabody Energy said it had dropped a plan announced eight years ago for a coal-burning plant in western Kentucky. Instead the company will build a plant to convert coal to natural gas, in part because it's easier to capture carbon dioxide for burial from such a plant, said Peabody's Vic Svec. 
Obama's election sharpened the trend. Last month, Lisa Jackson, Obama's chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency will reconsider a 2008 decision that the agency lacks the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants. Obama has asked Congress for legislation mandating carbon-dioxide cuts, but it's not clear whether such a bill will pass, let alone how strict it would be. 
"What you have right now is uncertainty," said Wayne Leonard, CEO of Entergy, a Fortune 500 power company. "When you look at the risks around the coal plant at this time, it's very hard to justify." 
Jackson said the nation can't afford to let power companies dangle indefinitely. "There needs to be some certainty," Jackson said in an interview with USA TODAY. "Without legislation to address (carbon dioxide), something's going to have to give." 
If there is less power from coal, the nation will have to turn to natural gas, which is subject to big price swings, or build nuclear plants, said Revis James of the Electric Power Research Institute, which is funded by the power industry. "Long term ... we're going to be facing some challenging scenarios," James said.

Abstract

Full Text 
To lift our economy and put Americans back to work, President Obama is making a major investment in clean energy. 
Clean energy is the best opportunity we have to create jobs today and launch the industries of tomorrow. It's also critical for our security -- to reduce our dangerous 
dependence on foreign oil -- and to save our planet from the potentially devastating effects of climate change. 
We have begun the transformation to a clean energy economy through the president's economic recovery plan. And to truly rise to this challenge, President Obama has pledged 

to invest $15 billion a year to develop and deploy the next generation of renewable energy technology here in America. 

As history has shown repeatedly with science funding, this investment will pay for itself many times over. Americans will save far more on their energy bills than we spend on 
research. 
At a time of economic crisis, this bold action is absolutely necessary. 
Meeting our energy challenge will require a partnership between government and private sector companies, but the government must lead. 
With a network of 17 national laboratories and researchers at 300 colleges and universities, the federal government knows how to do this work. Public investment in research 

has been critical to developing everything from hybrid-vehicle batteries to lifesaving cancer treatments. 
As we have in the past, we will work with the private sector to take breakthroughs on energy from the research lab to the manufacturing plant to the retail store. 
We will move with the greatest speed, transparency and accountability because we cannot afford to fail. We will post our progress on www.recovery.gov so you can know how 

your tax dollars are being spent. 

With these investments, we will unlock the true potential of solar and wind energy. We will develop advanced biofuels and learn to use coal in a clean way. We will make highly 
fuel-efficient cars and trucks. And those are just the technologies we already know about. 
This strategic investment in clean energy will unleash the innovations that will power our economy for years to come. 
Steven Chu is secretary of Energy and a co-winner of the Nobel Prize for physics.

Politics heats up global warming: Climate scientists are urged to get in game to aid understanding

Abstract 
First are direct effects: droughts, floods, heat waves. [...] are the economic cost of plans to cap emissions. 

Full Text 
Money and politics, the stuff of social science, now drive global warming, and climate science needs to get with it, a National Research Council report suggests. 
"Demand is growing for credible, understandable and useful information for responding to climate change," says the report, called Restructuring Federal Climate Research to Meet the Challenges of Climate Change. The report, released Thursday, calls for "transformation" of climate science to emphasize the climate's influence on food, economics and public health. 
Otherwise, there's lots of evidence that politicians will tackle such practical problems without scientists. 
In his speech to Congress last week, for example, President Obama asked his audience "to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change." The Senate and House had hearings last week that explored the economics of climate change. 
And the Center for Public Integrity reported that about 2,340 climate change lobbyists, advocating for everything from more nuclear reactors to money for saving coral reefs, have found employment since 2008. 
For the planet and its people, what's at stake is an expected rise of 6 degrees Fahrenheit in average global surface temperatures by 2100, described in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, if "greenhouse" gas emissions continue at current rates. Greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels such as coal, trap heat in the atmosphere and propel global warming. 
Containing them could be expensive. "People are wondering how much this is going to cost," says Peter Barnes, author of Who Owns the Sky?: Our Common Assets and the Future of Capitalism. "There are approaches out there that could benefit many people, or ones that could benefit just a few." 
Greenhouse gas emissions are surpassing the "business as usual" projections behind the estimated 6-degree increase, according to research presented by Stanford University's Christopher Field at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting last month in Chicago and last week at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing. 
A House Ways and Means Committee hearing discussed keeping emissions worldwide below levels needed to trigger a 2-degree rise, which poses "severe risks to natural systems and human health," says climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But Field warns that such an increase already may be locked in this century because of newly recognized effects: 
*Forest fires in drying tropical regions will release extra carbon dioxide. 
*Melting tundra in the warming Arctic releases methane, a greenhouse gas. 
*Warmer oceans are less able to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
"We're facing a very serious increase, almost certainly," Field says. 
Obama and his new Energy secretary, Nobel Prize winner Stephen Chu, have championed low-emission fuels, wind and solar power, advanced biofuels and clean coal, which is specially processed to reduce its carbon emissions. But Obama in his speech also called for a cap on carbon pollution. 
"That's the real story," Barnes says. "That's what the lobbyists are for." 
The research council report says, "Broadly speaking, there are two mechanisms by which climate change has a fundamental impact on the economy." First are direct effects: droughts, floods, heat waves. Second are the economic cost of plans to cap emissions. "There will be costs, and those costs will be borne by everyone," the report says. The problem is that "our knowledge of the economics of climate change is surprisingly incomplete and imprecise." 
Obama has called for setting up a cap on emissions and dividing the allowed emissions among the greenhouse-gas-releasing industries through the sale of permits. The anticipated revenue from those permits is $645 billion over 10 years. If the plan succeeds, Barnes predicts that industries and environmental groups will both want some of that money for their respective interests. He prefers giving voters monthly "stimulus checks" to offset the energy costs passed along by industries, "so taxpayers can see some benefits." 
TEXT OF INFO BOXES BEGINS HERE Fast growth from fossil to future fuels 
President Obama's call last week "to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy" encapsulated the hopes of a fast-growing energy industry aimed at alternatives to fossil fuels. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas today provide about 85% of energy in the USA. 
Wind power 
Windmills, such as these Colorado wind farm turbines, are the nation's fastest-growing renewable energy source, providing less than 1% of U.S. power but increasing the supply 177% from 2003 to 2007, the Energy Information Administration says. Wind varies, which makes power storage a priority in developing the technology. 
Solar power 
Small today but perhaps the most promising long-term renewable energy source. Nanotechnology advances promise better collection of the sun's energy. Solar power industry groups moved their 2009 October meeting to Anaheim, Calif., to accommodate 27,000 expected conventioneers, up from 12,500 in 2007. 
Nuclear power 
Nuclear reactors were not mentioned in Obama's speech, but they provide about 8% of power in the USA. They don't add to greenhouse gas emissions, and some utilities hope to increase the number of reactors. But questions about waste disposal, construction costs and weapons proliferation bedevil the technology.

Greenhouse gas villain rehabbed: Companies develop methods to repurpose carbon dioxide

Abstract 
CO{-2} emissions from vehicle tailpipes have helped spawn a multibillion-dollar ethanol industry as the nation fights global warming and strives to import less foreign oil. [...] he would prefer to capture CO{-2} from coal plants and store it underground -- technology that's at least a decade away -- and shift from gasoline-fueled cars to electric vehicles supplied by wind or solar energy. 

Full Text 
Carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is public enemy No. 1 to environmentalists. CO{-2} emissions from vehicle tailpipes have helped spawn a multibillion-dollar ethanol industry as the nation fights global warming and strives to import less foreign oil. 
But at least a handful of companies and scientists are turning that battle on its head: They're finding ways to recycle CO{-2} and turn it back into gasoline and other transportation fuels. 
While their projects are in the early stages, researchers say they've tested their technologies in the lab and are poised to unveil prototypes that could lead to commercial rollouts in as little as two years. If successful, such initiatives could reduce dependence on carbon-spewing, petroleum-based products, as well as renewable fuels such as corn ethanol that compete with food supplies. 
"Having a homegrown alternative to (oil) is an attractive proposition," says Jim Miller, a scientist at Sandia National Laboratories who's working on a CO{-2}-to-fuel project. 
Scientists demonstrated years ago that CO{-2} can be converted into liquid fuel by breaking it apart and combining the carbon atom with hydrogen. Those are the basic building blocks of hydrocarbons, such as oil and coal, and feed stocks such as corn and sugar cane. 
The problem: CO{-2} is very stable and can be split only under high temperature and pressure. That requires a lot of energy, which drives up costs. The start-ups are devising ways to unravel CO{-2} using less energy. 
Turbocharging their efforts: oil prices that were skyrocketing until recently, and a push in Congress to require utilities, oil refiners and others to pay fees for each ton of CO{-2} they spew. Under legislation anticipated by next year, the industries would eventually have to curtail their emissions. 
"There's just plentiful CO{-2}, and someone's going to be willing to supply it to us," says Derek McLeish, CEO of Carbon Sciences, one of the start-ups. 
Running ahead 
Carbon Sciences is furthest along in the CO{-2}-to-fuels quest. McLeish founded the company in 2006 as Zingerang, a mobile communications provider. But faced with a crowded wireless marketplace in 2007, he and other investors pivoted sharply from communications to carbon. They also changed the company's name, went public and raised $2.5 million. 
In June, company chief technology officer Naveed Aslam figured out a way to break down CO{-2} at low temperature and pressure. His secret? Biocatalysts. 
Although catalysts, such as enzymes and bacteria, can split CO{-2}, they're very expensive, and typically must be replaced after every reaction. Aslam invented a polymer shell that protects them so they can be recycled. The same technology can extract hydrogen from water, avoiding the need for energy-intensive hydrolysis. The carbon and hydrogen are joined to form methanol, which can be refined into gasoline or jet fuel. 
Aslam believes catalysts can be reused up to several million times but can't be certain until a prototype is completed this quarter. Costs should be competitive with ethanol, which now wholesales for about $1.65 a gallon, executives say. 
Many companies are working to convert the hydrocarbons in algae and plant waste into biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. But McLeish says, "Ours is the most direct path," and ultimately, quicker and cheaper. 
Carbon Sciences likely would license its technology to oil refiners, which emit large amounts of CO{-2} and have the expertise and infrastructure to produce gasoline, McLeish says. Other prospects include coal plants and concrete makers, which are big CO{-2} producers and will likely have to install technology to capture it. Although CO{-2} culled from such sources ultimately would be emitted through tailpipes, it would displace new oil, substantially reducing carbon emissions. McLeish expects a commercial deployment by 2011. 
David Doniger, policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, says such technology would be better for the environment than burning new fossil fuels. But he would prefer to capture CO{-2} from coal plants and store it underground -- technology that's at least a decade away -- and shift from gasoline-fueled cars to electric vehicles supplied by wind or solar energy. 
Other CO{-2}-to-fuel approaches: *Sunlight. Sandia lab researchers are tapping the sun's power to minimize energy use. They've invented a reactor containing a ceramic ring made of iron oxide and cobalt. A solar concentrator heats the ceramic material to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, forcing it to give up its oxygen. The ring then rotates to a colder chamber containing carbon dioxide. Having released its oxygen, the ceramic borrows oxygen atoms from the CO{-2}, leaving carbon monoxide only. The cycle repeats continuously. 
The same process removes oxygen from water to produce hydrogen. The carbon monoxide and hydrogen are joined to make a synthetic gas, which can be turned into methanol or gasoline. A prototype is scheduled to be ready late this month. 
*Wind. Morphic Technologies of Sweden has patented an enzyme to absorb CO{-2} from the air. Wind-turbine blades, coated with the enzyme, generate a huge air mass as they spin. CO{-2} sticks to the blades and is transported to the base of the turbine. There, excess energy from the wind turbines splits the CO{-2} and water into carbon and hydrogen. Since it's scraping CO{-2} from the air, Morphic could sell carbon credits to industries that must cut or offset emissions under expected greenhouse gas restraints, says CEO Martin Valfridsson. 
Ahmed Ghoniem, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering, says CO{-2}-to-fuels projects are technically feasible but face high hurdles. "Can you scale it up to produce a sufficient amount of (fuel) so you can build a business around it? It's challenging."

wraps up her week-long Asian trip. 
China literally changed Beijing's climate this week when it produced snow by seeding clouds with chemicals to help alleviate a three-month drought in northern China, the state-
run Xinhua News Agency reported. 

Clinton's focus will center on energy issues, as China now exceeds the U.S. as the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, a leading cause of 
climate change. 
On Saturday, Clinton will tour a thermal power plant, which has partnered with General Electric, that is 2 miles from Beijing's Olympic stadium, known as the Bird's Nest. 
The plant "is a showcase for cooperation between China and the U.S," says Jack Wen, president and CEO of GE Energy China. 

He says the plant fueled by natural gas is one of the cleanest in the country, which mostly uses coal-fired power plants. 
"The new team in Washington, D.C., is really starting to give the international community some hope in dealing with climate-change challenges," says Wu Changhua, the China 
director for The Climate Group, an independent advisory group. "It's crucial for the U.S. to start to demonstrate the leadership that's been missing for the past eight years." 

U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu co-produced a study released this month that urges Washington and Beijing to collaborate on climate change. "If these two countries cannot find ways to bridge the long-standing divide on this issue, there will literally be no solution," the report said. 
One dispute during the Bush administration involved the U.N.-backed Kyoto Protocol, which set binding targets for industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gases by 2012. China, which ratified the accord in 2002, insists that it be treated as a developing nation and held to a lower standard. The United States has not ratified the accord, citing economic worries and arguing that nations such as China should be held to the targets. 
"We are at a historic opportunity here," says Alex Westlake of ClearWorld Energy in Beijing, which supports renewable energy projects. "The benefits to both countries' jobs and economies will be tremendous. I hope the U.S. will offer an olive branch ... and recognize the good work that China has been doing." 
China's government and businesses have targeted renewable energy in recent years, from wind farms to pig farms. 
At the Haikou Agriculture & Industry & Trade Co., on Hainan Island, Tang Shanrong captures methane gas from manure at 16 of the firm's 40 pig farms. "The government encourages us to do this ... but it's difficult to make a quick profit," he says. 
Ma Zhuguo, a climate-change specialist at the government's Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, says, "The Chinese government has spent a lot of money and effort to reduce emissions in recent years. I think America itself should take more active measures to reduce emissions." 
Despite different perspectives between the U.S. and China, GE's Wen says, "Everybody agrees on the goal -- we need to figure out a way of cutting carbon to have a better world to live in."

Abstract 
The study says titanoboa (it means "titanic boa") was the largest non-marine vertebrate from the epoch following the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, and "greatly exceeds the largest verifiable body lengths" of the largest-known python (29.53 feet) or Eunectes, a species of which the anaconda is a member (22.97 feet).

Indiana Jones, take heart: A snake on the loose 58 million years ago would help anyone understand your phobia. 
Scientists have unearthed the fossilized remains of the largest snake ever discovered: a 42-foot behemoth weighing more than a ton, according to an analysis in today's issue of 
the journal Nature. By studying fossilized sections of the remains, scientists were able to estimate the size of the crocodile-consuming boa. 
The study says titanoboa (it means "titanic boa") was the largest non-marine vertebrate from the epoch following the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, and "greatly 

exceeds the largest verifiable body lengths" of the largest-known python (29.53 feet) or Eunectes, a species of which the anaconda is a member (22.97 feet). 

Titanoboa is a relative of the modern-day anaconda, a non-venomous snake inhabiting freshwater rivers in Central and South America and preying on carnivores it crushes with 
powerful muscles. A meal is satisfied with one long gulp. 
The vertebrae of titanoboa were found in a large coal mine in northeastern Colombia, an area the researchers report is the oldest-known rainforest in the Americas. 
Carlos Jaramillo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama has been studying in the coal mine for six years. 
"It's a fantastic viewing opportunity and perfect place to find fossils," he said Monday. 
When the botanist came across the fossils, he invited Jonathan Bloch, a curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Florida, to visit. Together, they excavated the 

remains and shipped them to the University of Florida. 
"I thought he had to be 100 feet long when I saw the vertebrae," Bloch said. 
Bloch said he immediately contacted Jason Head of the University of Toronto, a biologist and specialist in "the evolution of big snakes," and showed him the vertebrae during a 

video chat. 
"It was a moment," Head said. "The next thing I knew, I went down to Florida and we were starting our work." 
Head and David Polly of Indiana University determined the size using a ratio between the vertebral size and length of existing snakes. 
Why are today's snakes smaller? The report concludes that temperatures at the equator were higher (86-93.2 Fahrenheit) than today (82.4 Fahrenheit) and facilitated the large 

body sizes of air-breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependent on ambient environmental temperatures. 
"The Earth was globally warm then," Bloch said. "There was no ice at the poles, South or North. The remains of palm trees have been found there." 
So could global warming mean bigger snakes make a comeback? 
"We could try to scare everyone with that idea," Bloch said, "but in all honesty civilization would not let a snake reach this size again." 
Indiana Jones would be happy about that.

Abstract 
In touting their test flights, Kellner and other airline executives emphasize they're doing their part to address climate change by reducing the carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and particulates discharged from their jet engines. [...] in 2008 the big U.S. airlines burned about 19.6 billion gallons of jet fuel and paid an average price of $2.98 a gallon for it, according to estimates from the Air Transport Association, the trade group for U.S. carriers. 

Full Text 
HOUSTON -- Chickens can't fly very far. But chickens -- or the fatty parts left after processing -- could be powering jet flights across the country and around the world in the next few years. 
Or maybe it'll be algae, essentially pond scum, fueling them. Or jatropha, a smelly and poisonous subtropical plant with nicknames such as "black vomit nut" or "bellyache bush." Or liquid fuel converted from coal or natural gas, using a technology pioneered by Adolph Hitler's Nazi war machine. 
Airlines, airplane and engine makers, the fledgling synthetic and biofuels industry, the U.S. government, environmentalists and even the big oil companies are working together to develop alternative fuels from these and other sources. Their goal: to replace a significant portion of the 19 billion gallons of kerosene that U.S. carriers burn in their planes each year and to do it by the end of the next decade. If they succeed, airlines will reduce their carbon footprint -- and save big money that could possibly help hold down fares. 
The U.S. Air Force also is pushing development. By next year, it wants all of its planes certified to operate on a 50/50 mix of conventional jet fuel, known as Jet A, and alternative fuel. Air Force generals don't want their planes grounded by a geopolitical event that pushes oil prices through the stratosphere or stops the flow of foreign oil. 
The alternative fuel industry only now is beginning to move beyond the research-and-development stage into commercialization. Yet, enough progress is being made that it's safe to say it won't be long before Air Force pilots and commercial travelers will be flying in planes powered, in part or entirely, by synthetic or biofuels. 
"We're looking at five-year time horizons, not 20-year time horizons," says Continental Airlines CEO Larry Kellner. "This isn't going to happen in 2010, but it needs to happen before 2020." 
The International Air Transport Association, the trade group for airlines around the world, has a goal of replacing a quarter of airlines' oil-based fuel consumption with bio or synthetic alternatives by 2025 and a third of it by 2030. 
Earlier this month, Continental took a Boeing 737 up for the USA's first test flight of a jet burning a mixture of conventional jet fuel and biofuels. The test featured a 50/50 mix of Jet A and a biofuel in one engine. It was the fourth such test in the world in the last 12 months. It was the first using a plane with just two engines, and the first in which the alternative fuel was partially derived from algae. On Jan. 30, Japan Airlines will send up a jet using fuel that includes camelina, a weed sometimes called "false flax." 
In touting their test flights, Kellner and other airline executives emphasize they're doing their part to address climate change by reducing the carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and particulates discharged from their jet engines. 
Burning biofuel made from plants and even synthetic fuel made from liquefying coal and gas can cut a jet's carbon emissions. Although they emit carbon dioxide when burned, biofuels leave in the atmosphere only what the plants they're made from had absorbed. Synthetics also leave smaller carbon footprints than pure Jet A fuel. They also emit less nitrous oxide and particulate pollutants. 
What the airlines don't talk much about is the big money they could save by turning to alternative fuel. Results of the Houston flight are still being evaluated. But Continental test pilot Richard Jankowski reported that during the 80-minute flight, the plane's right engine burned noticeably less fuel than the left, which ran on pure Jet A. 
Burning less fuel translates into big dollar savings. 
For example, in 2008 the big U.S. airlines burned about 19.6 billion gallons of jet fuel and paid an average price of $2.98 a gallon for it, according to estimates from the Air Transport Association, the trade group for U.S. carriers. That's nearly $58 billion spent on fuel. A 5% reduction in fuel burned at last year's prices translates into $2.9 billion in savings. 
How big is that? U.S. airlines have reported net annual profits of $2.9 billion or more only six times in their history. Even at today's lower, and probably temporary, prices of about $1.51 a gallon, a 5% reduction in fuel consumption would generate about $1.5 billion in annual savings. 
Biofuels offer other potential savings. 
The European Union has pending legislation that would require airlines that fly there to pay through a pollution-allowances trading system if they emit too much greenhouse gas. Continental won't say how much it could save if burning alternative fuels can help it reduce its emissions and avoid paying European penalties. "We really haven't studied that yet," Kellner said before the test flight. 
But Barry Cohen, who heads the National Algae Association, a new trade group promoting algae production, says it's plenty. "It's in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year, per carrier, potentially," he says. Such penalties, on top of high fuel prices, threaten airlines' financial survival, he says. 
Closer to market 
Some alternative jet fuels are closer to market than others. Synthetic fuel already is tested and available. It's been around since the 1930s, when the Nazis began converting coal into gasoline using a method invented by German scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. Sasol, a South African company, began producing Fischer-Tropsch synfuels in the 1950s and beefed up production in the 1980s to help the nation cope with trade embargos for its former apartheid policy. 
Syntroleum, a firm based in Tulsa, supplied the Air Force with 100,000 gallons of synthetic fuel for flight testing in 2006. Beginning in 2016, the service plans to buy 400 million gallons of it annually -- enough to power a quarter of all its domestic U.S. flights in a year. 
The biofuel closest to market is animal fat, including that from chickens. 
Dynamic Fuels, a partnership between Syntroleum and meat-processing giant Tyson Foods of Arkansas, broke ground in October on a $138 million refining facility in Geismar, La. The plant will turn chicken fat, beef tallow, pork lard and grease into liquid fuel. It is expected to begin production in 2010 and turn out about 75 million gallons of fuel a year, says Ron Stinebaugh, Syntroleum's senior vice president of finance. 
Animal fat isn't the best long-term solution for deriving fuel from a renewable resource, says Jennifer Holmgren, head of the Renewable Energy and Chemicals business at UOP. Now a division of Honeywell, UOP developed most of the chemical processes used in refining today's petroleum fuels. Holmgren's unit is charged with doing the same thing for alternative fuels. 
"You aren't going to start raising animals for energy," Holmgren says. 
Better options are non-food crops, such as jatropha, camelina and algae, she says. Fuel from jatropha and camelina will be on the market within three to five years, she says. Fuel from algae is eight to 10 years away because research on it began later. 
There's not likely to be a single winner among the various alternative fuels that will be adopted for use by all the world's airlines, says Sebastien Remy, head of alternative fuel research for European airplane maker Airbus. "But there will be one specification for the quality of the fuels to come from these various alternative sources," he says. "The engines should not be able to tell the difference between conventional jet fuel and whatever alternative fuels airlines choose to use in the future." 
Which fuel is best for an airline may depend on location, he says. In Asia, camelina is abundant. In Australia, Mexico and parts of South America, where conditions for growing jatropha are ideal, it likely will be the primary source of alternative fuels, Remy says. In North America, synthetic fuel may make more sense because coal and natural gas are abundant. 
Longer term, algae may be what fuels the engines in U.S. airline jets. It can be produced in high volume, and the USA has plenty of space to grow it. 
"Jatropha and other grains will be on the market sooner, but only in the tens or hundreds of millions of gallons," says UOP's Holmgren. "Algae will be produced in the billions of gallons a little bit further down the road." 
Algae is among the fastest-growing organisms on Earth. It takes up little space relative to its production capacity. Some strains can go from incubator to harvest in 14 days. And it grows best in brackish water, either in ponds, in a high-tech greenhouse environment known as a bioreactor, or on "algae farms," where nutrient-filled water flows through miles of tubes winding around a few acres of land. 
"You get an awful lot of productivity out of 1 acre of algae when compared with 1 acre of just about any other crop," says William Thurmond, a bio-energy researcher affiliated with the National Algae Association. 
That kind of large-scale production is necessary to get the cost of algae fuel down enough to compete with conventional fuels. But it's doable, says Cohen of the National Algae Association. 
Three years ago, a gallon of algae fuel cost about $300. Today, it's $10 to $20 a gallon. Cohen says the cost of producing unrefined algae crude could be less than $1 a gallon in a few years as technical problems are solved and as production is ramped up to industrial levels. But that will require significant investment. 
Cohen, citing government estimates, says about $66 billion will be needed to meet demand by 2025. However, he says, that's far less than the $1 trillion invested in U.S. oil production, refining and distribution infrastructure. 
Tim Zenk, vice president at Sapphire Energy, the San Diego start-up that produced the algae fuel used in the Continental flight, says his company's investors are motivated in part by environmental concerns. 
But that's not the only reason. Investors led by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' Cascade Investments and by the Rockefeller Foundation's venture-capital arm funded Sapphire to the tune of $100 million because they also think algae production will be a great investment. 
"We think we'll get 3,000 gallons (of biocrude) a year per acre," Zenk says. "You're going to see very large scales of production."

A coalition of leading corporations and environmental groups plans to call today for aggressive reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, an initiative that eventually would raise electricity and gasoline prices. 
The group - which includes General Electric, ConocoPhillips, DuPont, Duke Energy and the Natural Resources Defense Council - will urge Congress to pass a law requiring emissions to be cut 80% by 2050, two people with direct knowledge of the plan say. They declined to be identified because the proposal won't be made public until today. 
The cuts are in line with targets advocated by President-elect Barack Obama. 
When it formed two years ago, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, which includes some of the USA's top industrial polluters, called for emissions reductions of 60% to 80% by 2050. The coalition today will lay out a far more detailed blueprint, seeking a 42% cut in emissions by 2030. 
The proposal comes despite the recession, which could make it difficult to pass costly climate-change legislation this year. But Kyle Danish, a partner in law and policy firm Van Ness Feldman, notes that caps on emissions likely would not begin for several years, after the economy recovers. Meanwhile, he says, businesses want to put their imprint on legislation that's likely to be passed by 2010. 
"They want to get in the game," Danish says. 
Under the group's proposed cap-and-trade system, utilities, oil companies and other manufacturers would have to acquire an allowance for every ton of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, that they emit. New power plants would have to buy their permits, while existing ones initially would get much of their allowances free. 
Over time, the cap would grow more stringent and allowances prices would rise, forcing utilities, for instance, to replace coal plants with wind farms. The costs are likely to be passed to consumers in higher electric bills or gasoline prices, for example. 
The proposal recommends a $10-a-ton minimum for a permit. To prevent CO2 permit prices from soaring, it calls for a store of credits to be generated by preserving forests; trees absorb CO2.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's environmental policies should be based on science, not interference from political appointees, President-elect Barack Obama's nominee to lead the 
Environmental Protection Agency told Senate lawmakers Wednesday. 
"Science will be the backbone of what EPA does," Lisa Jackson, the nominee, testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. She added that decisions by 
the chief environmental watchdog will "reflect the expert judgment of the agency's career scientists and independent advisers." 

Her comments follow repeated criticisms -- by the committee's chairwoman, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and advocacy groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists -- that the Bush administration had given assessments by government scientists a back seat to political judgments. Her statements also pointedly suggested that she intends to break with some controversial EPA decisions of the past eight years. 
At a wide-ranging confirmation hearing, Jackson won almost unanimous praise from lawmakers. Boxer said she hopes to "move quickly" to bring Jackson's nomination before 
the full Senate, where she could be confirmed as early as next week. 
Jackson said cutting emissions of chemicals that contribute to global warming and other types of air pollution will be among the Obama administration's top five environmental 
goals. The others, she said, are cleaning up hazardous waste sites, protecting water quality and dealing with toxic chemicals. 

"These five problems are tough, but so is our resolve to conquer them," Jackson said. 

The confirmation hearing served partly as a forum for Democratic lawmakers to batter the EPA's conduct during the Bush administration. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., 
called the agency "a disgrace to our country." Boxer said the agency "has hurt the American people, made them less safe." 
The panel's Republicans generally praised Jackson but criticized the new administration's plans to regulate carbon dioxide, linked to global warming. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., 

warned that such regulations could further damage an ailing economy. 
Jackson also said the Obama administration would: 
*Immediately assess hundreds of coal ash piles nationwide, following a pair of spills in Tennessee and Alabama. 
*Revisit controversial EPA rules, including a decision by outgoing Administrator Stephen Johnson that prevented California and other states from imposing their own limits on 

greenhouse gas emissions. 
*Bolster the government's commitment to children's health.

Abstract 
Environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) have urged Obama to move the United States to 100% renewable electricity from sources such as solar and wind power. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The Nobel Prize winner nominated to head the Energy Department said Tuesday that he would focus the department in part on global warming. The policy 
would be a sharp departure from the department's priorities during the Bush administration. 
"If we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate," physicist Steven Chu told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee during his confirmation hearing. 

Since 2004, Chu has headed the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which he redirected to focus on renewable energy. President-elect Barack Obama 

tapped Chu for Energy secretary last month. 
At the hearing, Chu, who often rides his bike to work, called for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the same time, he presented himself as a pragmatist 
who won't reject taking advantage of energy sources just because they are out of favor with environmentalists. 

New nuclear plants, continued reliance on coal-fired power plants and U.S. oil and gas drilling are all necessary, Chu said. Environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) have urged Obama to move the United States to 100% renewable electricity from sources such as solar and wind power. 
"We need all solutions," Chu said. "We need to make them as clean as possible as quickly as possible." 
The NRDC declined to comment, but one industry group took heart from Chu's statements. "We were encouraged by what we heard on nuclear and clean coal," said Keith 
McCoy of the National Association of Manufacturers. 

Chu seemed headed for an easy confirmation as early as next Tuesday, the day Obama will be inaugurated, said committee Chairman Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. Chu's qualifications drew praise from committee Democrats and Republicans alike. 
"It's great to have somebody of Dr. Chu's intelligence running the Energy Department," said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. 
On global warming, Chu said the U.S. should lead the way in cutting greenhouse gases. Chu, the son of Chinese immigrants, said he hopes that China -- the world's largest 
source of the main greenhouse gas -- will follow. 

President Bush cited inaction by China and India in his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 global-warming treaty adopted by nearly 200 nations but not the United States. 
The treaty exempted most developing nations, including China, from having to cut their global-warming emissions. 
"The United States should take the first step and hopefully the Chinese will immediately, very closely follow," Chu said. 
That drew a gentle rebuke from Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind. 
"That approach will not be enacted by the U.S. Congress," Bayh said. A climate treaty would have to be ratified by the Senate.

Abstract 
President Bush certainly has a penchant for protecting remote ocean ecosystems. His announcement Monday that he would set aside 195,280 square miles of Pacific Ocean in the Mariana Islands and elsewhere, combined with an ocean preserve he created near Hawaii in 2006, brings his total of protected waters above 300,000 square miles. 
That's an area bigger than Bush's home state of Texas. It's more than any person has set aside before and likely will for the foreseeable future. And it is, without doubt, a commendable effort to protect wide swaths of richly diverse aquatic life from commercial exploitation and waste dumping. 
The action two weeks before he leaves office does, however, underscore one of the unfortunate aspects of Bush's environmental policy. He is better at acting on behalf of the environment when there is no substantial business interest arguing the other side.

President Bush certainly has a penchant for protecting remote ocean ecosystems. His announcement Monday that he would set aside 195,280 square miles of Pacific Ocean in the Mariana Islands and elsewhere, combined with an ocean preserve he created near Hawaii in 2006, brings his total of protected waters above 300,000 square miles. 
That's an area bigger than Bush's home state of Texas. It's more than any person has set aside before and likely will for the foreseeable future. And it is, without doubt, a commendable effort to protect wide swaths of richly diverse aquatic life from commercial exploitation and waste dumping. 
The action two weeks before he leaves office does, however, underscore one of the unfortunate aspects of Bush's environmental policy. He is better at acting on behalf of the environment when there is no substantial business interest arguing the other side. 
Closer to home than the pristine waters off Guam, Bush's record is decidedly less favorable (though not as awful as some environmental groups assert). He has almost always sided with energy, automotive, timber and other financial interests in questions of how vigorously to protect the environment. 
For instance, Bush spent much of his administration resisting calls to take the threat of global warming seriously. When he came into office in 2001 he withdrew the United States from Kyoto Protocol on climate change. And he has largely ignored a 2007 Supreme Court ruling stating that the Environmental Protection Agency had to devise a plan to address the matter. 
Although Bush did move to impose tighter regulations on power plant and diesel fuel emissions, he has blocked efforts by states to enact air emissions standards more stringent than those of the federal government. 
Many of Bush's land use policies in the western part of the lower 48 states make sense only in a political context, as an effort to please a constituency of energy producers. He has pressed for greater logging in national forests and more accommodating regulations on coal mining. Several of his more benign environmental policies -- fuel efficiency standards on cars for instance, or more money for renewable fuels -- came only when Democrats claimed power on Capitol Hill or energy prices surged. 
It is in this context that Bush's conservation polices should be judged. While he deserves praise for his protection of the seas, it is impossible not to notice that by building an environmental legacy on remote ocean ecospheres he picked the easiest fights.

Falling prices extend to electricity: Lower construction costs reduce rates

Full Text 
After years of steep increases, costs to build power plants and transmission lines have started to fall, promising to temper electricity rate increases for consumers, according to a report out today. 
The development is notable because the nation is poised to build the biggest wave of plants in a generation to meet rising electricity demand, and capital costs make up 50% of utility rates, says Larry Makovich, a managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. CERA conducted the study. 
Construction costs have dipped 5% the past year and will likely drop an additional 7% to 10% next year, says Candida Scott, CERA's senior director of cost and technology. If the recession persists into 2010, further decreases are likely, she says. 
Behind the trend are plunging costs for raw materials such as steel and copper amid the global economic slump. Steel prices have tumbled nearly 30% in recent months, offsetting a sharp run-up earlier this year, Scott says. 
And as some utilities delay or cancel new plants, easing order backlogs, costs for equipment, labor, engineering and management are declining. While some utilities signed contracts for new generation at higher prices, others may wait for costs to fall. 
Nuclear plants have benefited most, with costs dropping 12% the past year, largely because they saw the sharpest increases. Since 2006, reactor construction expenses have soared to about $7 billion from about $3 billion. A big reason: Reactor vessels are supplied by just a few manufacturers. No nuclear reactor has been completed since the 1990s, but several dozen are being planned. 
Costs to build coal, wind and natural gas generators have risen slightly this year but recently have stabilized and are poised to fall, Scott says. 
"We're seeing some softening in the labor market that's bringing costs down" for some plant-upgrade projects, says Jason Cuevas, spokesman for Southern Co., one of the largest utilities. 
Consumers may be hard-pressed to notice any savings because power plant construction costs still have more than doubled since 2000, CERA says. A $1 billion plant in 2000 now costs $2.24 billion. 
Utility bills will likely increase 10% to 15% the next few years just to finance the new construction, Makovich says. But if expenses did not moderate, rates likely would jump about 20%, he says. 
After figuring in fuel cost increases, especially for coal, electricity bills likely will rise as much as 35% the next five years or so, Makovich says. Further increases are expected when Congress imposes fees on utilities' global-warming emissions. The recession should provide a brief reprieve. With natural gas prices falling and some utilities delaying projects, rates are dropping in some areas and should be fairly stable most of next year, Makovich says.

Abstract 
The nominees are: *Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, for Energy secretary. *Lisa Jackson, who headed New Jersey's environmental agency, for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief. *Nancy Sutley, Los Angeles' deputy mayor for environment, to be chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. *Carol Browner, President Clinton's EPA chief, to coordinate climate and energy issues across the government. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 12/17/2008: A story about President-elect Barack Obama's Cabinet in some editions Tuesday misstated who signed a climate-change treaty on behalf of the 
United States during the Clinton administration. It was Peter Burleigh, then the acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
As President-elect Barack Obama announced on Monday his choices for top officials to tackle global warming, the challenges they face were highlighted by the lack of progress 
at climate talks that ended last week. 

Representatives of nearly 200 nations met in Poland to work on a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that limited emissions of global-warming gases. Little headway was made, and talks ended Saturday. 
On Monday, Obama vowed to try to change that. 
"America will lead not just at the negotiating table -- we will lead, as we always have, through innovation and discovery," he said at a news conference in which he announced 
picks for energy and environmental posts. 

The nominees are: 
*Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, for Energy secretary. 
*Lisa Jackson, who headed New Jersey's environmental agency, for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief. 
*Nancy Sutley, Los Angeles' deputy mayor for environment, to be chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. 
*Carol Browner, President Clinton's EPA chief, to coordinate climate and energy issues across the government. 
"What the world does in the coming decade will have enormous consequences that will last for centuries," said Chu, who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
Expectations are high, both in the U.S. and around the world. At the climate talks, participants had studied the speech Obama gave to state officials just after Election Day 

about the need to act on global warming, said Robert Stavins, a Harvard University economist who attended the meeting. 
Many nations want the United States to "play a leadership role" in early 2009, Stavins said. "It's not a lot of time for the new administration to come up to speed." Adding 

urgency, nearly 200 nations will meet a year from now to write a new global warming treaty. Before those talks, Obama's advisers must work out how ambitious the treaty 
should be. 
The Clinton administration signed the 1997 treaty but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. 
The timing of the next session poses another challenge: For credibility's sake, the United States wants to take domestic action on global warming before the talks, said Myron 

Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank. 
Obama has said he wants to cut emissions of the gases that cause global warming -- which are produced by the burning of coal and gasoline -- by 80% by 2050. 
To do so, Obama will need Congress to pass a law. Democrats control both houses of Congress, but there is division within the Democratic Party over how to tackle climate 

change. 

"Congress is by no means in agreement," said Jonathan Pershing of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. "Getting 60 votes will be hard," referring to the 
number of senators needed to stop opponents from tying up legislation. 
The circumstances are the best they've been for passing legislation, said Steve Cochran of the Environmental Defense Fund, but the economic downturn makes the situation 

dicey. "It is very difficult to effect change when people are scared," he said. 

In a related appointment, the Associated Press reported that Obama will tap Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., this week to be his Interior secretary. The wire service cited an unnamed Democratic source who asked for anonymity to avoid pre-empting Obama's announcement.

Full Text 
With an environmentally-friendly Obama administration coming to power, a new green business coalition -- led by Nike, Starbucks, Levi Strauss, Sun Microsystems and 
Timberland -- is calling for stronger policies to slash global warming and to create a clean-energy economy. 
The coalition called BICEP, or Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy, includes consumer-product companies involved for years in business and environmental issues. 
BICEP officials say retailers, their supply chains and the larger economy will be hurt by global warming's potential effects. 
So BICEP is proposing more aggressive policies for: 
*Greenhouse gases. Tougher federal targets for greenhouse gas reduction, including 25% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. 
*Renewable energy. Federal regulations requiring that 20% of electricity come from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by 2020, and 30% by 2030. 

*Coal-fired plants. Federal laws limiting the building of new coal-fired power plants that do not capture carbon emissions. 
Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a coalition of environmental groups and large investors managing $7 trillion in assets, says she expects to see legislation using BICEP 
proposals. Lubber, a former Environmental Protection Agency official, says lawmakers need to hear that green energy "can be good for the economy." 

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the global industry for renewable energy will create millions of jobs as it grows from $148 billion today to $600 billion 
in 2020. 
Global warming "is of critical importance" to Starbucks and other companies, says Ben Packard, Starbucks vice president of global sustainability. 

Even small temperature changes will hurt agricultural regions worldwide. 
By 2010, Starbucks aims to cut energy use by 25% in its 15,000 worldwide stores, to make sure 50% of all store energy is renewable and to adopt green building standards for 
new stores. 

Sarah Severn, Nike's director of corporate social responsibility, says that Nike, among other green practices, has cut carbon emissions by 18% from 1998 to 2005 and has 
phased out SF6 global-warming gas from all Nike shoes with air-cushioning units.

Coal power plants may have to clean up their act: Ruling may force them to limit greenhouse gases

Abstract 
About 100 proposed coal-fired power plants in the USA may be required to limit their greenhouse gas emissions after the Environmental Protection Agency was blocked Thursday from issuing a permit for a proposed Utah plant without addressing the issue of global warming. 

Full Text 
About 100 proposed coal-fired power plants in the USA may be required to limit their greenhouse gas emissions after the Environmental Protection Agency was blocked Thursday from issuing a permit for a proposed Utah plant without addressing the issue of global warming. 
The EPA's appeals board said the agency didn't adequately justify its decision last year not to require controls for carbon dioxide emissions when it tentatively issued a permit for Deseret Power Electric Cooperative's planned coal plant near Vernal, Utah. 
The panel sent the case back to the EPA's regional office to determine whether CO{-2} constraints are required. It said it recognizes "this is an issue of national scope that has implications far beyond this" permit. 
The ruling has a far-reaching impact on dozens of coal-fired power plants awaiting permits. At the very least, it will delay by several months issuance of those permits, says Justin Hutt, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who represents utilities. 
And President-elect Barack Obama, who has pushed for aggressive limits on global warming, is likely to use the ruling as a springboard to mandate tougher controls on coal plants, says Sierra Club director Bruce Nilles. 
Coal plants are the single biggest culprit in global warming, accounting for about a third of CO{-2} emissions, the chief greenhouse gas. 
Currently, there are no federal limits on CO{-2} emissions by any industry. But last year the Supreme Court ruled that CO{-2} is a pollutant, paving the way for the EPA to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions -- something the Bush administration hasn't done. 
But the Sierra Club challenged the Utah permit, citing the high court's ruling and a law that says the best available technology must be used to limit any pollutant "subject to regulation." The environmental group argued that CO{-2} is regulated, noting emissions from power plants must be monitored and reported. 
The EPA disagreed, saying CO{-2} is not regulated because emissions are not constrained in any way. The appeals board rejected that narrow reading, as well as the agency's claim that it has no discretion to require CO{-2} controls. But it stopped short of ordering the EPA to impose them. 
In practice, however, the panel's ruling clears the way for the Obama administration to require cleaner technologies for coal plants. 
For example, an Obama EPA could require utilities to build more efficient plants that emit less CO{-2} or blend in cleaner-burning biomass with coal. 
"Now, on Day 1 (of an Obama administration) they can say every (plant) needs to have a CO{-2} limit," Nilles says. 
Longer-term, Congress is expected to impose caps on CO{-2} emissions, requiring companies to buy allowances for each ton of carbon they emit. Companies that exceed their limits could buy allowances from those that fall below them.

Energy: Economy may slow proposed investment in renewables 
Obama has advocated a dramatic makeover of the nation's energy infrastructure, calling for huge investments in renewable energy and hefty penalties for oil companies and 
utilities that emit global-warming gases. 
While analysts expect him to largely push forward with the cornerstones of his plan, they say the feeble economy and yawning budget deficit will likely force him to temper his 

proposals. 

Obama, for example, wants to spend $150 billion over 10 years to promote renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as biofuels, plug-in hybrids and clean-coal 
technology. The initiative, he says, will create 5 million new jobs. 
Tim Vandenberg of Washington Analysis says Obama will likely include a chunk of those expenditures in his economic stimulus plan to jump-start the economy. But the Wall 

Street bailout and big budget deficit likely will cause much of the proposed spending to be shelved, says Bruce Bullock, head of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern 

Methodist University. 
Obama also has said he wants to provide tax credits of $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a married couple to help offset higher gasoline and heating costs. Funding would 
come from a windfall tax on oil company profits. 

Vandenberg says the big drop in oil and gasoline prices since last summer likely has eliminated the need for relief. And oil giants are expected to report sharply lower profits 

next quarter. 
To combat global warming, Obama has aggressive targets to cut carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants, oil companies and other industries. He wants to slash emissions 
80% below 1990 levels by 2050, as leading scientists advocate, by setting strict limits and requiring companies to pay fees to emit CO{-2}. Businesses argue the costs would 
be back-breaking in a recession. 

Kyle Danish, a partner at Van Ness Feldman, a law and policy firm, expects Obama to stick to his target, noting other nations are seeking a significant U.S. commitment. But he 
says Obama likely will "ease into the program" in the early years to lighten the financial burden.

Labor: Unionization rules, raising minimum wage on the horizon 
The economy. The markets' meltdown. Taxes. Energy. They all got more attention in the campaign than labor policy. 
But make no mistake, organized labor spent hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of Obama and other Democratic candidates with one clear goal: passage of the Employee 

Free Choice Act, a measure that is likely to come up early in the new Congress. 
Currently, union representation elections must be held when 30% of a group of workers at a company sign cards calling for a vote. 

The EFCA would change that. Once 50% of the relevant workers sign cards, their work group would be unionized. Secret ballot votes no longer would be necessary. 

Union leaders see EFCA as the key to reversing their decades-long decline in membership and influence. "It will be the most important update to our outdated labor laws since 
the 1930s. There's no question about that," says Josh Goldstein, spokesman for the labor-backed American Rights at Work advocacy group. 
But James Sherk, a labor policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says EFCA would "spread unionization to industries such as retail," where unions are rare. 
"The consumer will pay higher costs if an industry gets organized. The employers simply pass on their costs to the consumers. And if consumers buy less, or don't buy at all, 

jobs, ultimately, will be lost," he says. 
Even without EFCA, wage rates likely will rise. Obama has said he wants to raise the federal minimum wage, which is scheduled to go to $7.25 from $6.55 an hour next July. 
In a note to clients, FBR Capital Markets analyst Andrew Parmentier warned that investors "will be surprised by the speed and degree to which the corporate agenda is replaced 

by 1970s-style economic populism." 
That worries some. 
"Obama has said he wants to raise (the minimum wage) to $9.50 an hour and to index it to inflation," Sherk says. "The problem is that raising the minimum wage reduces job 

creation."

Technology: Look for more government transparency 
Moments before delivering his victory speech, Barack Obama sent e-mail and text messages to millions of his supporters with an electronic thank-you note. 
Like no other presidential candidate has ever done, Obama used the Internet to raise cash, recruit volunteers and build loyalty. "He touched the citizenry and motivated them 

using current-generation tech tools," says Rob Enderle, tech analyst at Enderle Group. 

Obama has said he will name a chief technology officer tasked to increase government transparency. The new White House CTO will use webcasts, blogging and wikis to open 
insider politics to the electorate. 
The new White House CTO is expected to help shape policy on: 
*Tech jobs. Obama must balance the outsourcing of tech jobs and expansion of work visas for foreign tech specialists against vows to create jobs on U.S. soil. "The pressure 

from leading technology countries such as India and China will force the various factions of our government to work together to stay competitive in the world market," says 

Brian Swanson, president of software broker SRV Network. 
*Tech spending. Obama will direct spending of the U.S. government's $70 billion annual tech budget. Efficient spending could boost tech's big players and stir venture-capital 
investments. 

By "reinventing capital allocation," the new administration "will have a significant impact on innovation, growth and job creation," says Adam Greissman, CEO of Universal Data 

Interface. 
*Tech security. The Bush administration has done little to require major government contractors to vouch for the security of software coming from a chain of diverse suppliers 
under their control, says Alan Paller, research director at the Sans Institute. Obama could use the federal procurement process to force contractors to do a better job, and thus 
improve the nation's cyberdefenses, says Paller.

Health care: Administration must tackle issues one by one 

Economic woes, two wars and a growing budget deficit are likely to present stiff challenges to President-elect Obama's promises to expand health insurance coverage and 
reduce premium costs, policy experts say. 
While larger reform efforts may come later, many expect only scaled-down versions of the proposals to be taken up by Congress during the first half of 2009. 
"There are three or four things that have bipartisan support that would give the new president and Congress bragging rights that they are making some progress," says Robert 

Laszewski of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a consulting firm that advises insurers, doctors and hospitals. What is likely: 

*Expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which covers 6 million children but will expire on March 31. An additional 4 million children could be 
covered for $35 billion over five years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. 
*Aid packages for states or private employers. 
"The end of the year will be focused primarily on (economic) stimulus," says Dan Mendelson of Avalere Health , a private consulting firm in Washington, D.C. 

Additional funds for state Medicaid programs, which cover low-income adults and children, are possible, he says. Laszewski says Congress might also consider subsidies to help small businesses provide health insurance. 
*New rules and regulations on insurers. 
Obama wants to require insurers to take all applicants, regardless of their medical conditions. Congress may consider that and other rules, such as allowing the government to 
negotiate drug prices in Medicare, says Drew Altman of the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. 

*Trimming payments to insurers that offer alternatives to traditional Medicare. 

Such Medicare Advantage plans offer more benefits, but have been eyed for cuts by congressional Democrats because they cost more than traditional coverage. Savings could 
be used to offset projected payment cuts to doctors.

Agriculture: Farmers worry about trade deals 
The agriculture industry reacted cautiously to Barack Obama's victory, welcoming his support for farm subsidies but worried about his vow to renegotiate international trade 
deals could hurt farm exports. 
"His administration will be more favorable toward maintaining a domestic farm policy program," said American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman. "The trade issue 

may be a little problematic for us." 
Obama, an Illinois Democratic senator, has endorsed farm supports, with a $250,000 payment limit; implementing country-of-origin labeling on food products; promoting 
organic agriculture; and increasing conservation aid. He has said that he wants to renegotiate international trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. 

Obama has supported federal support for ethanol and biofuels production but has also said he is willing to take a second look at ethanol in light of tight world food supplies. The 
Renewable Fuels Association, which represents biofuels producers, cheered his win. 
Joel Newman, president of the American Feed Industry Association, said the organization agrees with Obama's stance on food safety and some energy issues but has some 

disagreements on ethanol, which the group feels shouldn't be reliant on government aid. 

"We're about 180 degrees apart right now" on trade, Newman says. In addition to creating a more stable financial and economic environment, Newman says his members want 
Obama to create a "more comprehensive energy policy." Energy prices are a big issue for the industry.

Abstract 
Texas and Colorado are among 27 states that have set enforceable standards for power production from energy sources such as wind and solar. On Nov. 4, voters in two more -­California and Missouri -- will have a say on renewable energy initiatives. That is great news for energy independence -- just not quite enough of it. 
Setting an aggressive national standard could dramatically accelerate the trend, as could tax incentives that would encourage homeowners to invest in generating their own power. 

Full Text 
In west Texas, where oil derricks might outnumber liberals, the notion of producing electricity from renewable sources such as wind is surprisingly popular. 
It started back in the mid-1990s, when Texans realized they had become net importers of fossil fuels, a blow to the state's wildcatter image. Worse yet, the state had some of the poorest air quality in the nation. 
In 1999 that led the state, under then-governor George W. Bush, to set power production targets for energy generation from renewables, which turned out to be mostly wind. The experiment went so well that in 2005, Texas upped its renewable goal again, this time vowing to produce enough clean power by 2015 to equal 10 large coal plants -- a target the state expects to surpass by the end of this year. 
Similarly, Colorado started with a goal of getting 10% of its energy from renewables, then the state upped it to 20% by 2020 when that goal was easily reached. Better yet, the state's utilities -- forced to look for new sources -- turned to homeowners who installed solar roof panels or other alternative energy generators. That's an extraordinarily efficient system because energy is wasted when electricity has to be delivered over vast distances. 
Texas and Colorado are among 27 states that have set enforceable standards for power production from energy sources such as wind and solar. On Nov. 4, voters in two more -­California and Missouri -- will have a say on renewable energy initiatives. That is great news for energy independence -- just not quite enough of it. 
Setting an aggressive national standard could dramatically accelerate the trend, as could tax incentives that would encourage homeowners to invest in generating their own power. 
Opponents say national standards, such as the 25% of power from renewable energy by 2025 supported by Barack Obama, are either unrealistic or best left to the states. John McCain supports renewable energy but has not proposed standards. 
Despite the success stories from Texas and Colorado, though, there are good reasons to embrace a national standard. Most of the 27 states have set standards only high enough to boost power from renewable sources to about 7% of production by 2020. 
That number could rise sharply if homeowners see profit in powering their homes with wind or solar energy, which tax deductions and the ability to sell energy to utilities could do. Prices for solar and wind equipment are likely to drop as rising demand lets the nascent industries in those fields achieve economies of scale. 
There are other incentives, as well. With the introduction of mass-produced plug-in cars scheduled for 2010, the nation's electrical grid is likely to take on an increased burden, pressing power prices upward. 
Meeting that demand with alternative energy not only would save consumers money, it also would mitigate global warming and enhance national security by reducing reliance on foreign oil. 
With oil and natural gas prices falling, national standards would help ensure that all the momentum toward renewables isn't thrown to the four winds.

Utilities shrink the role of coal: Power firms prepare for carbon reductions

Abstract 
Yet the new initiatives signal that a growing number of utilities are studying ways to shrink coal's role in their power mix as they face state mandates to reduce carbon emissions or increase renewable energy. 

Full Text 
The power industry is stepping up its shift away from coal-fired electricity amid global-warming concerns, as some utilities shut down generators early or terminate contracts to buy coal-based energy. 
So far, the trend involves just a handful of utilities that are generally closing older, smaller plants. Coal still generates half of U.S. electricity and about 30 new coal plants are under construction, the most in a generation. 
Yet the new initiatives signal that a growing number of utilities are studying ways to shrink coal's role in their power mix as they face state mandates to reduce carbon emissions or increase renewable energy. Coal is the No.1 CO{2} producer, and eventual U.S. carbon caps are expected. 
The trend "promises to grow" because of climate-change concerns, says Glenn Unterberger, a Philadelphia lawyer who advises utilities on environmental issues. 
*Colorado regulators have approved Xcel Energy's plan to shutter two small coal plants over the next four years. The utility plans to build a solar thermal plant and add new wind energy and natural-gas-fired power. 
"We are trying to help meet the governor's goal of reducing our CO{2} footprint," says Xcel spokesman Mark Stutz. Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter wants the state to slash carbon emissions 20% by 2020. Xcel, the USA's No.5 utility, hopes to shut down other coal generators, Stutz says. 
*Georgia Power is among several utilities that plan to convert a coal plant to a biomass generator that burns wood chips. 
Biomass has up to 50% less energy than coal, but the conversion is cost-efficient partly because Georgia Power plans to sell renewable energy credits to utilities in other states that have clean energy quotas. It also wants to diversify its fuel mix and is concerned about potential U.S. limits on CO{2} emissions, says spokeswoman Carol Boatright. 
DTE Energy Services plans to convert a coal plant in Cassville, Wis., to biomass next year. And Logansport Municipal Utilities in Indiana is studying a similar switch because coal prices have doubled this year, says Paul Hartman, superintendent. 
*Minnesota Power is unwinding a contract to buy coal power from a North Dakota supplier and will instead build a wind farm in that state. By 2025, Minnesota utilities must get 25% of power from clean sources and are encouraged to cut their CO{2} emissions 30%. 
Coal is expected to play a key role in the USA's energy future if a cost-effective way to capture and store plant CO{-2} emissions is developed. Yet about 70 planned coal plants have been canceled since last year on fears of global-warming legislation. The plant closings mark a new twist. To combat global warming, "we're going to have to start turning over the fleet" of existing plants, says Sierra Club's Bruce Nilles.

Abstract 
Environment Evangelicals less worried about global climate change Most respondents to the Baylor Religion Survey agree that "if we do not change things dramatically," global climate change will be "a disaster" (67%); coal, oil and natural gas will be exhausted (70%); and most plant and animal life will be destroyed (57%).

God is punishing us. 
Guardian angels protect us. 
The Earth is in grave danger. 
So finds Baylor University's newest survey on Americans' religious beliefs and practices. 
The survey, to be released today, is based on interviews with 1,700 adults conducted in fall 2007. Among the highlights: 
Environment 
Evangelicals less worried about global climate change 
Most respondents to the Baylor Religion Survey agree that "if we do not change things dramatically," global climate change will be "a disaster" (67%); coal, oil and natural gas 

will be exhausted (70%); and most plant and animal life will be destroyed (57%). 

But evangelical Protestants are significantly less likely (55%) than other religious groups to be alarmed about global climate change or to forecast destruction of life unless 
changes are made (49%). 
While 56% of U.S. adults say the government is not spending enough to improve and protect the environment, fewer evangelicals do -- 41%, says Baylor sociologist F. Carson 

Mencken. 

Indeed, evangelicals are at least twice as likely as any other major religious group to say the government is already spending too much. Most likely to say spending is too little: 
Jews, 81%, and people with no religious affiliation, 79%. 
"So much for the myth of the evangelical environmental movement," Mencken says. "This is not to say that evangelicals are anti-environment, but their support for 

environmental issues is not as strong as other religious traditions." 

Environmentalism has been controversial among evangelicals. When the National Association of Evangelicals launched a "Call to Action" on climate change in 2006, some 
religious conservatives, led by James Dobson of Focus on the Family, strongly opposed it. 
Gender and politics 
Are women suited for politics? Americans are deeply divided 
The survey reveals deep divisions over women's roles in society, splits that may play out in the November elections. 
For example, 33% of Americans say "Most men are better suited emotionally for politics than most women." But 44% of evangelical Protestants agree, more than other 

Christians and markedly higher than Jews (29%), other religions (23%), and those with no religion (14%). 

Baylor's data were gathered in 2007, when Sen. Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, but long before Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was named to the Republican 
vice presidential ticket, putting motherhood and gender in the spotlight. Palin is a mother of five, including an infant with Down syndrome. 
Both Republican candidates are evangelical Protestants (John McCain is Baptist and Palin non-denominational). Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is a mainline 

Protestant (United Church of Christ), whose running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, is Roman Catholic. 
The survey also finds: 
*41% say a preschooler suffers if the mother works (54% of evangelicals say so, nearly double for other groups). 

*31% say "it's God's will that women care for children" (48% for evangelicals). 
Will these views shape votes? 
"People may hold these social values, but they don't always translate at the polls," says Lauren Winner, assistant professor of Christian spirituality at Duke University. "While a 
conservative view of gender roles is a piece of an evangelical worldview, it's not the most important plank for people -- abortion is. 
"People can spin Palin's contravention of traditional roles -- a nursing mother possibly in the White House -- by latching on to her clear pro-life stance." 
Tragedy and evil 
Dealing with evil: 
Candidates disagree 
God either causes or allows "major tragedies to occur as a warning to sinners," say 20% of U.S. adults. 
While 43% say most evil is caused by the devil, 47% disagree -- a statistical tie. 
But most (68%) would not say human nature is basically evil. 
So where does evil dwell -- in the devil or in mankind? The Baylor survey allows for overlapping views; it finds 36% strongly agree with both statements. 
"Those who believe God causes or allows bad things to happen did not speak in terms of tragedies being God's fault," says Baylor sociologist Christopher Bader. 
Bader says people told him that "tragedies are our fault. We have sinned as a nation and God has stood aside and allowed terrible things to happen." 
At his Saddleback Civil Forum on the Presidency, the Rev. Rick Warren asked the presidential candidates: "Does evil exist?" Both candidates said yes. 
Sen. Barack Obama said it is "God's task" to "erase evil from the world" but "we can be soldiers in that process." 
Sen. John McCain said, "Evil must be defeated," and linked it entirely to "the transcendent challenge of the 21st century -- radical Islamic extremism."

Abstract 
Record-high prices for gasoline, heating and electricity and growing concern about global warming have pushed energy issues to the forefront of the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama says he is open to a bipartisan proposal in the Senate that would lift the moratorium on drilling in a small portion of the 1.76 billion-acre Outer Continental Shelf, the sloping undersea region between the continent and the deep ocean around the USA, if the move came in conjunction with aggressive commitments to new clean energy technologies and efficiency. 

Full Text 
Record-high prices for gasoline, heating and electricity and growing concern about global warming have pushed energy issues to the forefront of the 2008 presidential 
campaign. 
Not since the gas lines of the 1970s has energy loomed so large as it does in the race between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama, says Kenneth Medlock, an 
energy expert at Rice University. And it's an issue that is unlikely to fade between now and November. 

While the candidates agree on a few energy-policy issues, such as not drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they are far apart on others. McCain, for instance, is more supportive of offshore drilling and strongly favors nuclear power. Obama envisions a bigger role for government in the nation's energy future, seeking to invest billions in new technology while mandating stronger fuel-efficiency and alternative-energy standards. McCain wants to rely more heavily on existing laws and market forces. 
Both candidates are far more willing than President Bush to tackle global warming by imposing new fees on greenhouse gas emissions. 
Consumers, who are reeling from high energy costs, will be watching to see how any action might hit their wallets. 
"The prices are completely outrageous," says Amanda Browning, 31, of Detroit. Browning, a single mom who is at home taking care of her two children and 87-year-old 

grandfather, says it's not just about cost. She's concerned about energy's impact on the environment and the USA's reliance on foreign oil. 

No matter who wins, there is likely to be far more action on energy policy than in the past few presidencies as high prices and concerns about global warming push the issue to 
the top of many lawmakers' to-do lists, says Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at the Stanford Financial Group. 
"Something is certain to happen next year," Valliere says. 

Oil drilling 
Both candidates have softened their positions 
High energy prices have forced both candidates to soften their positions on oil-drilling restrictions, but they continue to disagree on the key issue of drilling offshore. 
Obama says oil companies need to focus on drilling in areas already leased to the oil and gas companies and supports more drilling within areas, such as in parts of the Gulf of 

Mexico, where exploration and production is already permitted. 
Obama says he is open to a bipartisan proposal in the Senate that would lift the moratorium on drilling in a small portion of the 1.76 billion-acre Outer Continental Shelf, the 

sloping undersea region between the continent and the deep ocean around the USA, if the move came in conjunction with aggressive commitments to new clean energy 
technologies and efficiency. Obama argues that drilling in the area is not an answer to reduce prices in the short-term or to promote long-term energy independence. 
McCain advocates a complete lifting of the ban on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
Congress imposed a moratorium on drilling in new offshore areas in 1981. It is hard to know how big an impact drilling in the OCS would have on energy costs, says Bruce 

Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. It's unknown how much oil and natural gas is there, how accessible it is or how easy it would 
be to hook up to pipelines, he says. 
Neither candidate supports opening up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. 

Electricity McCain wants to build 45 nuclear power plants 
McCain is far more bullish than Obama on conventional electricity generation, especially nuclear power, as a way to meet soaring energy needs. McCain wants to build 45 nuclear plants which emit none of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming by 2030. That's ambitious. Until recently, no company had filed an application for a reactor since the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown. 
"We are at a national security exposure due to imported oil, and (McCain) would love to see nuclear power as part of the climate approach," says McCain senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin. 
Some experts are skeptical. 
"It's not going to happen," says Robert Kaufmann, director of the school of public and international affairs at Boston University. He says it's simply too tough to get permits to build nuclear reactors, largely due to safety and waste-storage concerns. 
McCain also favors big subsidies to help the nuclear industry achieve his goal. Even conservative groups says that conflicts with his opposition to subsidies for ethanol. 
"He's picking favorites," says Kenneth Green, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. 
Obama, by contrast, says that before the nation builds a new generation of nuclear reactors, issues such as the security of nuclear fuel and where to store waste must be solved. Some say he's paying lip service to a vital energy source. 
"He's putting so many caveats on it, he's saying in effect we're going to do nothing," says Deborah-Wince Smith, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a group of CEOs, university presidents and labor leaders. McCain, meanwhile, favors Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a repository for nuclear waste; Obama does not, saying he wants to study alternatives. The Department of Energy has chosen Yucca, but concerns about costs and hazards such as earthquakes have stalled plans. 
The candidates also differ on coal, which supplies 50% of U.S. electricity but accounts for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions, the chief greenhouse gas. Both want to develop technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal plants. McCain, though, says the U.S. should continue to build coal plants meantime. Obama says new coal plants must be designed to permit retrofitting of carbon-capture devices when the technology is available in a decade or more. 
Global warming Similar strategies, but Obama's more aggressive To combat global warming, both Obama and McCain want to impose new constraints and fees on companies that emit carbon dioxide. But Obama's plan is more aggressive. Under a so-called cap-and-trade system, utilities, oil companies and other polluting industries would get a limited number of allowances from the federal government to spew 
carbon dioxide. Utilities that fall below their cap by switching from coal to renewable energy, for instance, could sell permits to those that exceed their limits. The cap would 
grow more stringent over the years. 
Obama wants to reduce emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 the amount the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international monitoring group, says is 
needed to prevent a worrisome rise in global temperatures late this century. 

McCain was one of the first Republicans to break with his party several years ago and introduce cap-and-trade legislation. But now he's calling for more modest carbon dioxide reduction than Obama: 66% below 1990 levels by 2050. 
"It has to be a policy that can get through the Senate" without dampening economic growth, McCain senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin says. 
A bill that recently fizzled in the Senate would have required a 71% cut in carbon emissions by 2050. It would have raised electricity rates 45% in some areas and boosted 
gasoline prices 25 cents a gallon under some forecasts. 

"We need to get to at least an 80% reduction if you're serious about avoiding the worst impacts of climate change," says David Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
But Tim Profeta, director of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy at Duke University, says the two candidates' goals are roughly similar. A big difference, though, is that 
Obama wants polluters to pay for permits; he would use the revenue for clean-energy research. McCain wants to give away most permits so consumers don't get socked with 
higher energy prices. 

Price relief 
Obama wants tax credits paid for by oil companies 
McCain and Obama have deep differences on delivering relief to U.S. consumers slammed by the rapid rise in energy costs. 
Obama advocates tax credits of $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a married couple making up to $150,000 to help offset higher costs for gasoline, heating and other costs. 

The rebates, which would go to approximately 150 million Americans, would be paid for with a windfall tax on oil company profits. McCain is opposed to a windfall tax, arguing it 
would discourage investment. 

Last summer, when the average price of gasoline rose to more than $4 a gallon, the candidates called for different remedies. 
McCain during the summer supported the temporary repeal of the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents per gallon as prices at the pump broke records. That proposal is tabled for 
now as the summer driving season has ended. Obama is opposed to the repeal of the federal gasoline tax, arguing it doesn't provide much relief to consumers and reduces a 
key source of funding for roads and other infrastructure. 

Obama advocated taking oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help reduce prices. He proposed the removal of 70 million barrels, or about 10% of the amount of oil in 
the SPR, to be replaced within 12 months. 

Cars McCain backs big fines on carmakers with low mpgs 
Each candidate would use tax credits to promote higher-mileage automobiles. Obama would require manufacturers to meet higher mileage requirements, while McCain would increase the punishment for automakers that fail to meet the current mileage standard, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. 
CAFE is the average miles per gallon of a manufacturer's entire fleet manufactured in the USA. 
Obama proposes increasing the U.S. fuel-economy standard by 4% per year in perpetuity. The increases would lead to 49.5 miles per gallon by 2025, up from the current 25. 
"Technologically, it's feasible," Matthew Auer, an environmental expert at Indiana University, says of Obama's proposal. Obama backs a $7,000 tax credit for alternative vehicles such as plug-in hybrids and would mandate that all new cars be able to run on alternative fuels, such as biofuels. 
McCain backs raising the penalties for violating the existing CAFE standard but does not support increasing the miles-per-gallon requirement. 
A number of European automakers, such as Volkswagen and Porsche, pay millions in fines each year for not complying with CAFE. McCain advocates making the penalties high enough that it will be worth it to the companies to comply. 
McCain also proposes a $5,000 tax credit for a zero-carbon-emission car, such as cars that are battery-powered. He does not advocate mandating that all cars run on alternative fuels. 
Renewable energy 
Candidates split over subsidies for innovation 
Everyone loves renewable energy, and Obama and McCain are no exceptions. Obama, though, has a more aggressive plan for expanding the role of renewables, while McCain espouses a more market-based approach. 
Obama proposes spending $150 billion over 10 years for development of wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable energy, including fuels like cellulosic ethanol, made from grasses and plant waste. That, he says, would create 5 million jobs. 
McCain is less precise, proposing a tax credit for companies doing research on renewables equal to 10% of their employees' wages. 
Obama also favors a national standard requiring utilities to get 10% of their electricity from renewable power by 2012 and 25% by 2025. He also would require the U.S. to use 60 billion gallons a year of cellulosic ethanol by 2030. 
McCain opposes quotas for the percentage of electricity from renewable sources, preferring to let industry decide how to comply with a cap he'd impose on greenhouse gas emissions. (See "Global warming.") 
The candidates also disagree on subsidies. 
Obama supports current multibillion-dollar subsidies for ethanol but also backs a tariff on sugar cane-based ethanol that makes it more difficult and costly to import from Brazil. 
McCain opposes ethanol subsidies and the tariff. "His view is $4 gasoline is incentive enough," his senior adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin says.

Abstract 
Compressed air Facilities put stored air to work when wind dies Wind farms are sprouting across the country as wind energy costs become competitive with those of coal-fired power plants. In December, Nanosolar opened a factory in San Jose that's capable of pumping out 430 megawatts of solar capacity a year, nearly the size of an average coal-fired power plant. 

Full Text 
The nation is turning to alternative energy as never before amid concerns about global warming and runaway fossil-fuel prices. 
Wind and solar power, for example, each grew 45% last year, while the U.S. consumed 633,000 barrels of ethanol a day in June, up 43% from a year earlier. 
But alternative energy has not broken into the mainstream because of myriad roadblocks. Solar energy, for example, is expensive. Wind power is available only when the wind 

blows. 

But hundreds of companies are working to overcome the obstacles. Through June, venture capital investments in alternative energy companies this year totaled $980 million, up 
92% from a year earlier, says Dow Jones VentureSource. Here are four technologies that show promise: 
Compressed air 
Facilities put stored air to work when wind dies 
Wind farms are sprouting across the country as wind energy costs become competitive with those of coal-fired power plants. But there's a rub: no wind, no electricity. 
Batteries can store electricity generated by wind for use on a day when the wind doesn't blow. But they're expensive. 
PSEG Global, a sister company of a New Jersey utility, says it has the answer. It recently teamed with energy storage pioneer Michael Nakhamkin to market compressed-air 

technology. 

Here's how it works: During off-peak hours, wind turbines compress air that's stored in underground caverns or in more expensive above-ground tanks. The air is released at 
peak periods to run turbines and generate power when gusts flag. 
The nation's only compressed-air generator was built in Alabama in 1991. PSEG says it has improved on the technology and hopes to deploy it with power providers. 
PSEG says its advanced system can transform the industry. It's about half the price of batteries, partly because it uses off-the-shelf power-industry parts rather than customized 

compressed-air gear. 
The technology is more than 25% cheaper than current systems, says Stephen Byrd, president of PSEG Energy Holdings. 
Also, it can generate electricity in five minutes, vs. current systems that take 20 minutes. That's vital if the wind suddenly stops blowing. "It really is likely to further enable the 

growth of renewable" energy, Byrd says. 

While the system is largely designed to supplement intermittent wind or solar power, it can be used to stockpile cheap electricity at night and use it midday when the grid is 
strained. 
Energy consultant Stow Walker says it sounds promising, but finding suitable underground storage can be challenging. 
Thin-film solar panels 
Printing process cuts down on the cost of silicon, a key material 
Here's one way to bring down the price of solar energy: make churning out solar panels as easy as printing a newspaper. 
That's precisely what start-up Nanosolar has done. The company says it's poised to be the first among dozens of manufacturers to make solar competitive in price with 

conventional electricity. 
While solar-system costs have fallen, they're still about 20 cents to 30 cents per kilowatt hour, or more than twice the price of electricity from your local utility. 
That's largely because traditional solar-system makers use expensive silicon as a semiconductor to generate electricity from sunlight. 

Thin-film makers have pushed down costs by using a tiny fraction of the semiconductor. But most still employ a slow and expensive condensation method to attach the semiconductor onto a base. Yet with production volumes rising, solar energy generally is expected to be competitive with grid electricity in 2010 or after. 
Nanosolar, a Northern California company, says it can achieve that next year because of its printing process. 
It embeds tiny semiconductor particles in ink, then coats a layer of it onto mile-long rolls of aluminum foil, which is later cut into solar panels. The company says it can turn out 
panels at a rate of 100 feet a minute, 20 times faster than typical thin-film makers at a tenth of the cost. 

"It's all about higher throughput," to more cost-efficiently leverage fixed labor and equipment costs, Nanosolar CEO Martin Roscheisen says. 

In December, Nanosolar opened a factory in San Jose that's capable of pumping out 430 megawatts of solar capacity a year, nearly the size of an average coal-fired power plant. 
It plans to produce huge solar panels for cities and other utility-scale users this year and target businesses and homes next year. 
Consultant Paul Maycock of Photovoltaic Energy Systems says Nanosolar's systems "could be one of the more exciting products" in solar energy's history. 
But he says the company has not delivered the production volumes it promised a few years ago. Roscheisen would not discuss its output, noting Nanosolar is private. 
E-Coal 
No greenhouse gas in coal substitute 
Imagine an electricity source that kind of looks like coal and packs all of coal's energy punch but is cheaper and produces no greenhouse gas emissions. 
That's what Seattle-based NewEarth Renewable Energy says it developed with E-Coal. It's biomass made from plants or other organic waste and heated to boost its energy 

content. 
"We can produce (clean) fuels that are pound-for-pound replacements for coal," NewEarth CEO Ahava Amen says. 
In 2004, after making a small fortune in cosmetics, Amen and some former associates reunited to tackle global warming. 
They hunted for a substitute for coal, the biggest greenhouse gas producer. Biomass emits carbon dioxide when burned but absorbs the same amount in its lifetime. Yet it yields 

a third to half of coal's energy, raising fuel costs and limiting the size of current biomass power plants. NewEarth boosts its energy content by placing the biomass in an oxygen-

deprived chamber and heating it to 250 degrees. 
The resulting solid is condensed, and unwanted gases and moisture are removed. The heating process was invented decades ago, but Amen says NewEarth has made it cost-
efficient. It's using as its feedstock a fast-growing plant, Nile reed. 

Because the energy value equals coal's, he says, there's no need to spend millions to upgrade plant boilers. Plus, he says, E-Coal costs 5% to 40% less than regular coal. Initially, a utility likely would blend a small amount of E-Coal with its coal. But Amen says a plant's entire fuel stock can be replaced. He says he's negotiating with dozens of utilities. 
Larry Joseph, former U.S. Energy Department official and investor in the company, says utilities are very cautious and want clear evidence they're not going to harm their 
equipment. 
Algenol: 
Company uses algae to make ethanol more eco-friendly 

Corn-based ethanol is getting slammed for straining the world's food supply and contributing to global warming by encouraging the plowing of grasslands. 
Cellulosic ethanol, a more eco-friendly version derived from switch grass or wood chips, is several years away. Maryland-based Algenol says it can solve the problems by making 
ethanol from algae, starting next year. 

The start-up recently agreed to license its technology to BioFields, which plans to build an $850 million saltwater algae farm in Mexico's Sonoran Desert and churn out 100 

million gallons of ethanol the first year. It will sell the gasoline substitute to Mexico's state-run oil monopoly. 
A handful of companies are working on turning the abundant marine organism into biodiesel. That requires growing algae and killing them to extract their oil, a time-consuming 
and expensive process. 

Algenol adds enzymes to the organisms to enhance their normally limited ability to convert sugar into ethanol, a waste product. To maximize ethanol production, the algae are placed in regions with abundant sunlight and grown in 50-foot long tubes filled with seawater. Ethanol is captured as a gas in the bottle and condensed to a liquid. Since algae aren't destroyed, the same ones keep yielding ethanol, holding down costs. 
Algenol CEO Paul Woods says production costs are half those of corn-based ethanol, and the fuel will wholesale for $1 less than gasoline. His goal: Woods wants to build 20 plants in sunny areas such as Texas and Florida to generate 20 billion gallons of ethanol by 2020. "We don't have any limitations, because we're not competing with the food supply," Woods says. 
Philip Pienkos, of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, says Algenol's goal is "definitely doable." But he says there will still be a need for fuels with higher energy content 
than ethanol.

Bid to weaken species act deserves to be shot down

Abstract 
If the agencies didn't see a problem, there would be no reason to trigger the automatic review now required by Fish and Wildlife or the National Marine Fisheries Service. *Prevent the May listing of the polar bear as endangered from being used as a reason to block big projects that might contribute to global warming. 

Full Text 
The thick woods along Virginia's broad James River, about halfway between the Chesapeake Bay and Richmond, sustain important nesting grounds for the bald eagle. So imagine the alarm in the early 1990s when Fish and Wildlife Service officials found that several eagles had been electrocuted on Dominion Virginia Power distribution lines. 
Given that the national bird was on the Endangered Species List, immediate action had to be taken. The utility installed $20 plastic contraptions that prevented the eagles from roosting in spots where they'd come into contact with hot wires. 
That relatively simple solution, combined with hundreds of similar actions taken around the USA when highways or bridges were built near nesting areas, led to the bald eagle being taken off the endangered list last year. 
Now, in its waning months, the Bush administration has decided that the red tape involved in preserving the eagles and other species is too much to bear. To "improve" the 35­year-old Endangered Species Act, the Interior Department has proposed new regulations that would: 
*Allow federal agencies to decide for themselves whether their actions would endanger protected species. If the agencies didn't see a problem, there would be no reason to trigger the automatic review now required by Fish and Wildlife or the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
*Prevent the May listing of the polar bear as endangered from being used as a reason to block big projects that might contribute to global warming. 
The second of these proposals is less disturbing than the first. The notion that environmental groups could halt federal projects in the USA over melting arctic sea ice is a stretch. Global warming policy should be set by the White House and Congress, not by lawyers squabbling over polar bears. 
But the plan to remove automatic review by fish and wildlife experts is truly alarming. It's one of several regulations the lame-duck Bush administration is trying to push through to reward its backers and tie the hands of its successors. 
In this case, it's ludicrous to expect that federal agencies that build dams and roads will seriously search out impediments to their projects. Even small children can cite the fox-and-henhouse parable. 
To illustrate the conflict of interest, environmental groups point to this recent incident: In December, the Bureau of Indian Affairs concluded that its coal-fired power plant, the Desert Rock Energy Project in New Mexico, posed no threat to endangered species. Fish and Wildlife, conducting its mandatory review, discovered two endangered fish and one bird. 
To be sure, the Endangered Species Act isn't perfect, and it hasn't always been applied with common sense (remember the snail darter?). Developers have some good reasons to detest it. Even so, the Bush administration is calling a trick play in the fourth quarter, attempting to win a change that failed to get through a Republican-controlled Congress only three years ago. 
A 30-day comment period on the proposed changes ends Sept. 15. Bird watchers might want to weigh in before then.

Coal king Peabody cleans up: As profits rise, company pushes 'clean coal' strategy

Abstract 
The scene repeated around the clock here at the world's largest coal mine, Peabody Energy's North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Powder River Basin underscores both the abundance and the grimy nature of the USA's most plentiful energy resource. While coal-fired power plants generate half of U.S. electricity, coal is the biggest carbon dioxide producer, accounting for 40% of worldwide emissions. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 8/20/2008: Peabody Energy has coal-trading offices in London and Beijing. A story about the company on Tuesday incorrectly identified the location of the Beijing office. 
WRIGHT, Wyo. A mammoth shovel scrapes about 70 tons of coal shards off a 60-foot-high black wall like ice cream from a long, deep vat. 
The power shovel's boom pirouettes and dumps its load into a truck bed with a resounding thud, kicking up a haze of black dust. Four scoops later, the outsized truck think 12­foot-tall tires brimming with a fresh dark mound, rolls off. Without missing a beat, the shovel dives back into the bounty, releasing its next load just as another truck backs in. 
The scene repeated around the clock here at the world's largest coal mine, Peabody Energy's North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Powder River Basin underscores both the abundance and the grimy nature of the USA's most plentiful energy resource. 
As oil and natural-gas prices remain high and lawmakers agonize over whether to drill for oil in environmentally sensitive areas, coal looms as an antidote still relatively cheap despite recent price surges because of a boom in exports. 
While coal-fired power plants generate half of U.S. electricity, coal is the biggest carbon dioxide producer, accounting for 40% of worldwide emissions. CO{-2} is the chief culprit in global warming. To environmentalists, coal is public enemy No. 1. 
Peabody, the world's largest coal company, sits squarely at the vortex of these countervailing forces. 
Until recently, it was a bright spot in a bear market, its shares up more than 40% the first half of the year. Falling oil and natural gas prices have pushed them down about 30% since early July, but shares are still up about 700% since 2003. Peabody closed at $57.09 Monday, up 1 cent. 
Pointing to robust overseas sales, analyst David Khani of Friedman Billings Ramsey predicts shares will more than double in a year. Foreign markets deliver more than half of Peabody's profits, up from 1% in 2003. 
In the USA, Peabody is perhaps the staunchest opponent of stringent regulations to cap greenhouse gas emissions even as stalwarts such as ExxonMobil and American Electric Power have softened their stances. 
A bill to curb global-warming gases fizzled in Congress in June, partly because of opposition from Peabody and the coal industry. It would have forced utilities and others to buy permits to emit carbon, passing the costs to consumers and boosting electric rates up to 45% by 2020. 
About 30 coal-fired power plants are under construction around the country, the most in a generation. Peabody, along with partners, is building a $3 billion, 1,600-megawatt coal generator in Illinois, the biggest U.S. coal plant in 25 years. 
Peabody is "the large, unrelenting, unrepentant poster child for the coal industry," says Sierra Club director Bruce Nilles. 
Yet the likelihood of climate-change legislation after a new president takes office has prompted U.S. utilities to cancel or delay about 60 coal plants the past year. That has injected at least a sliver of uncertainty into the coal industry's future: Some experts say its prospects are bleak if technology to capture CO{-2} at coal plants and store it underground preventing its release through the smokestack proves too expensive for utilities. 
In an interview at Peabody's St. Louis headquarters, in his corner office facing the gleaming Gateway Arch, CEO Gregory Boyce shrugs off any worries. He says coal is just too plentiful to be cast aside, especially with power demand soaring. He notes Peabody's coal has 50% more energy value than Exxon's oil reserves, and the USA has 27% of the world's coal, a 200-year supply. 
"It's a good time to be Peabody," says Boyce, an affable man who speaks in a confident baritone. "There's not enough natural gas. There's not enough renewables (such as wind and solar energy) to go around. So I'm not concerned that coal is going to disappear. For us not to use that resource, we are just shooting ourselves in the foot." 
Boyce dismisses the Sierra Club's criticism. He says Peabody backs climate-change regulation, but only after carbon-storage technology is developed; it could take at least 10 years. Otherwise, he says, consumers will be socked with added costs without any benefits. 
"The U.S. economy is not healthy," he says. "The cost of electricity has only just begun to rise. Therefore, we ought to be prudent in how we go about regulation." 
David Hawkins, climate-center director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls that "a self-defeating position" aimed at squashing regulation. Utilities, he says, won't deploy costly carbon-capture technology unless they face high fees to emit CO{-2}. 
Boyce laments that the Bush administration recently scuttled a big demonstration project to sequester CO{-2} called FutureGen because of its $2 billion cost. Peabody is one of 12 companies that had agreed to chip in $30 million each to FutureGen. Although Nilles says Peabody could have funded the entire project if it wished, Peabody's position is that developing such costly new technology is too risky for any one company to take on alone. 
Far from phasing out coal, Boyce wants to expand use of "clean coal" to solve the energy crisis. "Clean coal" would be scrubbed free of CO{-2} thanks to carbon-capture technology. Peabody kicked in about $9 million this year to an ad campaign touting "clean coal." Boyce is leading a push for coal that's turned into a liquid with part of its CO{-2} captured in the process to replace gasoline for vehicles and gasified coal to supplant natural gas, though environmentalists criticize the initiatives. 
"We wonder why we pay $4-plus for gasoline," says Boyce, moments before holding up a half-inch-long bottle filled with colorless liquid coal. "Coal has to be a big centerpiece of our energy strategy because it's our major reserve base. 
"There's a perception out there that coal is dirty, and we have to change that," he adds, noting that coal plants already have cut emissions of some pollutants and boosted efficiency to slash CO{-2} discharges. "Black is the new green." 
The company was plodding along when Boyce joined as president and chief operating officer in 2003. U.S. coal demand was rising 1.3% a year, and Peabody stock was mired at about $7, adjusting for splits. 
Boyce, 53, a lifelong mining executive who previously headed international coal giant Rio Tinto in London, decided to tap a ravenous appetite for coal in developing economies such as China and India. At Peabody, he led mine acquisitions in Australia, a major supplier to Asia, and opened trading offices in London and Berlin. Today, Peabody is the only 
U.S. coal company with overseas mines. 
"I was thinking I need to get a big part of the business that's growing 8% a year vs. relying on the U.S. market growing 1% to 2%," Boyce says. 
That's paying off big time. China built 96,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants last year, the equivalent of all of Britain's coal plants. The country is putting up coal plants at the rate of one every other week. India plans to build 75,000 megawatts of coal power by 2012. 
Buoyed by foreign sales, Peabody recently said it expects per-share earnings of $2.50 to $3 in 2008, nearly double last year's results, on the production of about 230 million tons of coal, equivalent to 20% of the U.S. total. Its coal fuels 10% of U.S. electricity and 2% of worldwide power. It's also benefiting from a tripling in the price of coal to make steel. 
Yet the torrid global market is squeezing the U.S. as mining companies divert coal to countries willing to pay much higher prices. U.S. coal exports should jump 39% in 2008 to 82 million tons, says Stifel Nicolaus analyst Paul Forward. 
That, in turn, has tightened supplies. Prices for Appalachian coal have jumped from $45 to more than $100 a ton since last year. Citing soaring coal costs, dozens of utilities recently announced electricity rate increases of up to 30%. 
Most of the exports are from Eastern mines, such as those in the Appalachians, that sell coal with higher energy content and are closer to Gulf of Mexico ports. 
About 65% of Peabody's output and 40% of U.S. production is from the more productive Powder River Basin, a virtual Saudi Arabia of coal. Prices there are far lower, about $12 a ton, partly due to the coal's lower energy content. Also, coal can be extracted more easily from seams as thick as 100 feet vs. typical 3-foot seams in Appalachia. 
Yet even Powder River coal is riding the export wave, with some heading to Europe and Asia and prices up 50% since last year. Peabody is also sending a growing portion of the region's coal to Eastern utilities to replace foreign-bound Appalachian coal. 
The supply crunch is delaying shipments, forcing utilities to scramble to keep coal-fired plants running. "We're having to work very hard to get our coal delivered," says Vince Stroud, head of regulated fuels for Duke Energy. 
If the shortage persists into next year as expected, utility inventories will likely fall so low they might have to scale back coal generation, replacing it with pricier natural gas, says Seth Schwartz, a principal at consulting firm Energy Ventures Analysis. Alternatively, he says, utilities will face another steep price increase up to 70% for coal, further pushing up power prices. 
Boyce makes no apologies for the exports, saying utilities "are competing on a global basis to buy that coal, and they've never had to do that before." 
Perhaps no mine is better suited to meet surging demand than the 80-square-mile North Antelope Rochelle. It's an other-worldly moonscape gouged with 180-foot-deep pits, some flanked by football-field-length walls of coal, others already shorn bare. 
Despite its size, the mine grinds along with assembly-line efficiency. After workers set off explosives to form a pit, a skyscraper-high shovel called a dragline removes the rocks and dirt covering the coal. Coal production is so high that several trucks typically queue up at garagelike structures where coal is unloaded and crushed into smaller bits. 
From there, small piles are whisked on plastic-enclosed conveyors to towering silver silos, where coal is briefly stored until it's plopped onto open-car freight trains crawling at about 1.5 miles per hour. About 20 trains a day roll in on two lines, each toting away about 12,000 tons of coal. 
After years of minimal capital outlays, Peabody recently spent about $200 million to ratchet up production. Expenditures include a larger dragline, a 3.5-mile-long conveyor to minimize fuel-hogging truck trips, and a new train-loading facility that blends various grades of coal from different silos, providing utilities with more customized mixes. 
In a room lined with PCs and video screens, new software tells dispatchers precisely where trucks are so they can be routed efficiently, and warns of low tire pressure or worn brakes. Workers seem unfazed by coal's role in the global-warming debate. 
"We're mining something that's helping the whole country," says supervisor Lyle Ramsey, 60, as he surveys a pit. "It bothers me that people don't understand what's going on."

As energy demands grow, nuclear deserves new look

Abstract 
The nation's energy problem is so serious that every reasonable solution should be pursued, including conservation and efficiency, renewable sources such as wind and solar, cleaner ways to burn coal, and offshore and Alaskan drilling for more secure oil supplies. 

Full Text 
Access to the North Anna nuclear plant in central Virginia is granted by guards with automatic weapons. The plant's two reactors sit inside twin domes of 4 1/2-foot thick concrete lined with sheet steel and reinforced with miles of steel rebar as thick as a baseball bat. Most of the 40-foot-deep spent-fuel pool lies below ground, minimizing the target for any attacker. Computer modeling says a Boeing 767 hitting a reactor dome or a pool wall would fail to make a hole. 
The control room belies the Homer Simpson stereotype. Operators who spend two years getting licensed to do their jobs watch a wall of gauges and are in turn watched by supervisors, who are in turn watched by inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On the grounds outside, radioactive waste is stored in concrete vaults and rows of 115-ton steel canisters. 
It's not that nothing could go wrong here, but the safety and security risks seem less ominous and more manageable than opponents of nuclear power make them out to be. The nation's nuclear plants have worked without a serious accident for almost 30 years, since the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania nearly killed the industry but spurred changes in the way plants are designed and run. 
Now nuclear is getting a new look -- utilities have submitted 11 applications for 18 new reactors, though no company has committed to building yet -- and for good reason. Nuclear power, which already produces about 20% of the nation's electricity at 104 plants, offers potentially enormous amounts of 24/7 energy at a time when demand is rising. A coming shift to plug-in hybrids and electric cars will only increase the need. Nuclear also offers major help in reducing global warming because, unlike coal-burning plants, atomic power emits little or no greenhouse gases. Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore once derided nuclear energy but now says it's clean and reliable. 
Remaining nuclear skeptics -- including Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama -- insist that safety and waste disposal issues be resolved before the nation builds more nuclear plants. That seems like a disingenuous prescription for deferring new plants indefinitely. 
At the same time, though, nuclear cheerleaders such as Republican presidential candidate John McCain, who has called for building 45 plants by 2030, are overlooking nuclear's more serious problem. At as much as $12 billion apiece, the plants are breathtakingly expensive to build, and even with substantial government subsidies, utilities are wary. 
Only one or two companies in the world can make the huge pressure vessels and other special components for nuclear plants, and there's a shortage of the skilled nuclear workers necessary to build and operate them. None of this disqualifies nuclear, but it should temper overly optimistic projections of how big a contribution nuclear can make. 
The nation's energy problem is so serious that every reasonable solution should be pursued, including conservation and efficiency, renewable sources such as wind and solar, cleaner ways to burn coal, and offshore and Alaskan drilling for more secure oil supplies. Assuming that utilities can make the finances work, nuclear is an important and proven part of the mix.

Full Text 
Five years after the worst blackout in U.S. history, the nation's electrical system is far better equipped to prevent another big outage, but significant shortcomings remain, federal officials, grid operators and consultants agree. 
Since the blackout on Aug. 14, 2003, which affected 50 million people in the Northeast, Midwest and part of Canada, federal regulators have approved standards for upkeep of the power grid. And utilities have new systems to monitor the network. 
"I can definitively say the events that led to the 2003 blackout are much less likely to occur," says Rick Sergel, head of the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), which enforces the new rules. 
But there are still concerns: 
*The USA still doesn't have enough power plants and transmission lines to meet surging demand for electricity, which strains the grid, says Branko Terzic, an energy adviser for Deloitte Services and a former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member. Utilities have canceled plans for dozens of coal plants amid global-warming concerns; environmentalists have opposed new transmission lines. 
*While new computer systems better monitor network glitches, "The grid doesn't have a brain" that "makes sense of it in a holistic way" and responds, says Roland Schoettle, CEO of Optimal Technologies. 
*Joseph Kelliher, FERC chairman, says cyberterrorism is a threat and that his agency needs authority to prevent it without publicizing its measures. 
The 2003 outage began when several transmission lines owned by FirstEnergy in Ohio automatically shut down because they came too close to trees. That caused electricity to be rerouted to other transmission lines, which, in turn, overloaded and failed. Since power plants and high-voltage lines must be in balance, the failures caused a ripple effect that shut down generators and lines across eight states. A computer bug kept FirstEnergy from identifying the problem. 
In 2005, Congress gave FERC new authority to set standards that, among other things, require utilities to trim trees to prevent them from contacting power lines, and to ensure that operators are trained and certified. NERC can fine companies up to $1million per day per violation. 
Also, new computers let regional grid operators monitor small changes in power flow. The Midwest Independent System Operator and PJM Interconnection, which oversee regional grids, say systems predict the results of line failures and stop outages by adjusting power. FirstEnergy spent $20 million on computers.

Hamilton's record-breaking performance in Major League Baseball's All-Star Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium last week is a living testament to the fact that people who struggled with drugs in the past can change their lives in a positive way ("It's not just a comeback for Hamilton," From the Press Box, Sports, July 15).

I couldn't believe the shallow, narrow-minded response President Bush had regarding our failed economy: "It's been a difficult time for many American families" ("Signs of a growing crisis," Cover story, News, Wednesday). 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke said, "The economy continues to face numerous difficulties." A fourth-grader could have concluded that. 
Instead of stating the obvious about our abysmal economy, why not come up with some solutions to get it back on track, such as cutting back on foreign aid to Israel and Egypt 
or ending these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are just a few ways we could at least curb our government spending. 

Bush needs to get a new group of economic advisers who can steer this country on a new path, instead of the dismal one that we are on that is leading to economic oblivion.

Don't just blame Bush 
Like a lot of misguided citizens, USA TODAY reader Jeff Crider faults President Bush for the nation's energy problems. Stand in line as everyone bashes Bush for any reason 

("Drilling is a step back," Letters, Thursday). 
The letter was written with the belief that oil is a major contributor to global warming, which many disagree on, and it suggested alternative sources of energy as the answer. 
This is partially correct. We do need to develop long-term alternative energy sources, and in the meantime, our national need for oil is evident. We can start research on 

hydrogen power, erect nuclear power stations, mine our abundant resources for coal and drill for the oil that we will need during the interim. 

Oil is important to people living in the Midwest who cannot or do not have mass transit. The automobile is crucial in that part of the country, and cars can't run on electricity 
alone.

Ballplayer back on track 
Texas Rangers Josh Hamilton is the new golden boy of baseball. Hamilton's record-breaking performance in Major League Baseball's All-Star Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium 

last week is a living testament to the fact that people who struggled with drugs in the past can change their lives in a positive way ("It's not just a comeback for Hamilton," 

From the Press Box, Sports, July 15). 
A few years ago, Hamilton, who developed an addiction to alcohol and drugs, was at a low point in his life when he was suspended from baseball for nearly two seasons. Instead 
of giving in to the downward spiral of drug addiction, he made an effort to turn around his life. After eight stints in rehab, Hamilton was finally able to kick his addiction and 
return to baseball. Although he didn't win the Home Run Derby crown, battling and defeating the monster of addiction makes him a winner. 

Hamilton didn't have to deal with his demons behind bars. Instead, his addiction was treated as a medical problem, which helped him get his life back on track. Hamilton's story 
sends a powerful message to society. Drug addicts can become productive citizens, if given the chance. 
But Hamilton's case is the exception, not the rule. We need to give individuals who are struggling with addiction to drugs or alcohol the treatment they need instead of a jail cell. 
Maybe then we can give other would-be stars a second chance to make good on their potential.

WASHINGTON -- In May 1998, at the urging of the state's coal industry, the Illinois Legislature passed a bill condemning the Kyoto global warming treaty and forbidding state efforts to regulate greenhouse gases. 
Barack Obama voted "aye." 
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee now calls climate change "one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation," and proposes cutting carbon emissions 
80% by 2050. But as a state senator, from 1997 to 2004, he usually supported bills sought by coal interests, according to legislative records and interviews. 

Obama is not the only politician whose public stance has shifted on global warming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says has been caused chiefly by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, who now backs limits on carbon emissions, was among 95 U.S. senators who voted in 1997 to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, an emissions reduction scheme that had been negotiated by then-vice president Al Gore. 
Still, Obama, who touts his independence from special interests, made a point of embracing the coal industry as part of his quest for statewide office. When he ran for U.S. 
Senate in 2004, he was flanked by mineworkers to proclaim that "there's always going to be a role for coal" in Illinois. 
"He understands how important coal is to the state of Illinois and to the Midwest," said Illinois state Rep. Dan Reitz, a Democrat and former coal miner who sponsored the anti-
Kyoto language and campaigned for Obama during the West Virginia primary. 

Employees of coal companies and electric utilities have contributed $539,597 to Obama's U.S. Senate and presidential campaign, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCain, whose energy plan calls for taxpayers to invest $2 billion in "clean coal" research that includes technology to capture carbon emissions, has received $402,365 from coal and utility interests during the same period, since 2004 to the current campaign, according to the center. 
Straddling two worlds 
The Obama campaign did not respond to questions about his support for the coal industry, except to address his 1998 Kyoto vote. The campaign said in a statement that the 

Kyoto treaty did not have "meaningful and achievable emissions targets," and that Obama "did not believe that state agencies in Illinois should unilaterally take steps to 
implement a global policy on their own." 
The statement said Obama supports investing in technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal burning. 
Meg Boyle, global warming policy specialist for Greenpeace, called those technologies risky and expensive. She said they can't "deliver in time to avoid the most dangerous 

impacts of climate change." 
"He's definitely trying to straddle two politically irreconcilable objectives: taking decisive action against global warming while keeping a healthy coal industry," said Frank 

O'Donnell, president of the non-partisan Clean Air Watch. "Obama's record certainly suggests that environmentalists aren't going to be calling the shots in his administration 
without input from industry." 
Obama's other votes on coal in the state Senate included: 
*In 1997, he voted to divert sales taxes to a fund for grants to help reopening closed coal mines and "incentives to attract new businesses that use coal." 
*In 2001, Obama voted for legislation that offered $3.5billion in loan guarantees to build coal-fired power plants with no ability to control carbon emissions. 
*In 2003, he voted to allow $300 million in taxpayer-backed bonds to build or expand coal-fired power plants. 
"You know, I am a strong supporter, I think, of downstate coal interests and our need to prop up and improve the outputs downstate," Obama said on the Senate floor before 

voting on the 2001 bill. 
A mixed reaction 

Obama's overall environmental record was exemplary, said Gene Karpinski, president of the Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters, which spent $400,000 to help Obama in the 2004 U.S. Senate primary. 
In one of his first acts in the U.S. Senate, Obama bucked Illinois' energy industry and voted to kill a Bush administration air-pollution proposal opposed by environmentalists. "When forced to chose between the coal industry and the broader public interest, he chose clean air," said Jack Darin, head of the Illinois chapter of the Sierra Club. 
Environmentalists were less pleased, though, when Obama voted for a 2005 energy bill opposed by McCain and most Democrats. Obama said he liked the bill's support for renewable energy. The bill contained $9 billion in coal subsidies, according to Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the bill "significantly weakens environmental protections." 
Obama also drew criticism for sponsoring a bill in January 2007 to devote $8 billion in subsidies to a technology to convert coal to liquid fuel. The Sierra Club says liquid coal "releases almost double the global warming emissions per gallon as regular gasoline." 
As the presidential campaign was well underway in June 2007, the Obama campaign issued a clarification: He would not support liquid coal processes unless they emit a fifth less carbon than conventional fuels. 
"When you're running for president and you've got environmentalists biting your head off every day, that's to be expected," said Phil Gonet, head of the Illinois Coal Association. "We're still optimistic that he may be helpful at some point in the future."

Abstract 
The large number of affected acres is increasing the risk of large fires as the Northern Rockies enters the fire season, said George Weldon, deputy director of fire, aviation and air for the U.S. Forest Service's Northern Region. 

Full Text 
Amy Gannon, hatchet in hand, sliced a slab of bark from a lodgepole pine tree near Wolf Creek, Mont., and quickly spotted a mountain pine beetle larva no bigger than her pinkie fingernail. 
"This tree's done for," said Gannon, an entomologist with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. 
As wildfires roar through tinder-dry forests in California, the mountain pine beetle is silently killing even more trees -- hundreds of thousands of acres of towering trees, mostly 
lodgepole pine, according to Robert Mangold, director of Forest Health Protection for the U.S. Forest Service. 

An epidemic of this magnitude hasn't been seen in the Mountain West in 25 years, he said. 
In 2007, the beetles were blamed for killing 3.9million acres of trees in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, Mangold said. 
By comparison, the fires in California had burned 640,847 acres as of July 14 this year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. An average of 3.4million acres has 

burned nationally each year since 2003, according to the center. 

The current pine beetle infestation is the worst since 1981, when 4.7million acres of trees were infected, Mangold said. He blames the outbreak on a perfect storm of drought, 
large stands of old trees and, possibly, warmer temperatures because of climate change. 
"It's shocking," said Jeff Witcosky, an entomologist for the U.S. Forest Service in Lakewood, Colo. "We talk about the grieving process." 
While the impact has been enormous, Mangold said, the mountain pine beetle is a native insect that, along with fire, does play a role in the regeneration of lodgepole pines. 
The pines have a hard cone that won't open without a hot fire, he said. When the cones open, they dump out seed, creating a thick forest of trees of the same age. When the 

trees hit 80 to 90 years old, they weaken and become susceptible to the mountain pine beetle. The beetles kill the trees, creating more dry fuel for those fires, he said. 

This month, the adult beetles are emerging from trees and looking for hosts they can bore into to mate and lay eggs, Gannon said. The beetles feed on the inner bark, severing the tree's circulation, she said. The large number of affected acres is increasing the risk of large fires as the Northern Rockies enters the fire season, said George Weldon, deputy director of fire, aviation and 
air for the U.S. Forest Service's Northern Region. 
"When there's red needles on the trees, those trees are a lot more flammable," he said. 
After the needles fall off, the fire risk is reduced, but if the dead trees are not harvested, they create even more fuel for fires, he said. 
Signs of bigger problems 
The Northern Region of the Forest Service is spending $15 million a year to reduce hazardous fuels around communities, including trees felled by the beetle, Weldon said. The 

region is made up of Montana, northern Idaho and North Dakota. 
Jesse Logan, a forest ecologist in Emigrant, Mont., sees evidence of a bigger problem in the beetle infestation than fire: global warming. 
"This is one of the canary-in-the-coal-mine warning signs," he said. 
The beetles are now moving into higher elevations, where bitter winter temperatures used to keep them at bay, Logan said. 
Once there, the bugs are attacking species besides lodgepole with new vigor, such as whitebark pines around Yellowstone National Park and the jack pine in British Columbia, 

Canada, he said. 
"It's like a new invasive species," Logan said. 

The whitebark pine produces seeds that are a critical staple in the diet of grizzly bears, Logan said. Fewer pines of all kinds also means less shade cover for cool-water mountain 
streams where trout thrive, he said. 
The trees also hold snow in place, slowing mountain run-off so water is available for irrigation deeper into the summer. 
Mangold agrees warming temperatures are playing a role in the current outbreak. 

"But the forests are in a state where we'd have this kind of epidemic probably with or without these temperatures," he said. 
Gordy Sanders, resource manager for Pyramid Mountain Lumber in Seeley Lake, Mont., which produces boards from logs, said the infestation is "devastating the countryside." 
Anyone who owns standing timber is losing aesthetic land value, he said. 

Slowing the spread 

To ward off the pests, chemicals that mimic those produced by the beetles, causing them to pass the trees because they sense they are full of other beetles, are sometimes 
applied to high-value trees around campgrounds and homes, but the treatments are expensive, said Ken Gibson, an entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service in Missoula, Mont. 
Forestry practices, such as thinning thick stands of pure species of trees, can also slow the spread, he said. 
"We don't have to sit around and watch trees die," he said.

Abstract 
Obama trumps McCain with a plan to require utilities to produce 25% of their electricity with solar, wind, biomass or other renewable energy sources by 2025. John McCain and Barack Obama on energy policies: *Windfall profits tax McCain: no Obama: yes *Expanded offshore drilling McCain: yes Obama: no *Alaska refuge drilling McCain: no Obama: no *Gas tax holiday McCain: yes Obama: no *More nuclear plants McCain: yes Obama: yes *Tax breaks for solar, etc. 

Full Text 
For years, Washington has been so feckless in reacting to the energy crisis that it's sometimes hard to believe the nation's elected officials grasp the threat. By importing nearly 60% of the oil we use, we don't just leave ourselves vulnerable to higher prices and lower living standards, we prop up oil-rich nations that include some of our fiercest enemies. 
In response, the nation has done almost nothing. Presidents have generally offered up warmed-over and incomplete solutions. Republicans say drill; Democrats say conserve. Congress hasn't done much more than hold hearings that sometimes look like show trials, hoping to score political points. 
So it's reassuring that the two presidential candidates appear to take the energy crisis seriously and have ambitious ideas for attacking it. Sen. John McCain calls energy policy "one of (the) great questions" of this campaign, and Sen. Barack Obama says it's "one of the greatest challenges that this generation of Americans will ever face." 
That's not exactly surprising since to say otherwise in an era of $4 gasoline seems foolish. Nor is either candidate above a little pandering. McCain backs a gasoline tax holiday that would save consumers virtually nothing, and Obama supports a windfall profits tax on Big Oil that is more an expression of pique than productive policy. And while both have worthwhile proposals, each rules out too many useful solutions. Getting the USA past its dependence on foreign oil will require many fixes. 
If you roll McCain's and Obama's proposals together, though, they add up to a credible energy plan. Some examples: 
*Offshore drilling. McCain trumps Obama by calling for more offshore drilling to increase U.S. supplies. Obama complains that it wouldn't cut pump prices now and might eventually add only a small amount to world supplies, which is true but misses the point. Increasing U.S. supply and cutting imports while the nation shifts away from oil is a worthwhile goal. 
*Renewable electricity. Obama trumps McCain with a plan to require utilities to produce 25% of their electricity with solar, wind, biomass or other renewable energy sources by 2025. This is a smart approach that sets a necessary target but leaves it to the industry to figure out how to meet it. 
*Tax incentives for solar, wind, etc. Tax breaks have been a useful way to nurse alternative fuels into the marketplace. McCain opposed them until changing his position recently to join Obama in support. Imagine what might happen, for instance, if it made economic sense for people to install solar panels on their homes, as happens now in Germany, thanks to subsidies. 
*More nuclear power. McCain's call for 45 new nuclear plants by 2030 is a daunting, possibly unrealistic goal, and Obama doesn't want any more plants until there's an acceptable way to secure the waste. But both men acknowledge that nuclear power should be a growing part of the equation. They're right. 
*Government funding. If spending billions of dollars on energy research could solve the energy crisis, we wouldn't be having this conversation, since that's already been done. Obama would spend about $15 billion a year. McCain wants much less, chiefly for coal. There's a role for this kind of spending, especially for coal, where the challenge is using America's enormous supply without worsening global warming. The questions are how much to spend and where to focus. Setting mandates and providing tax incentives while pressuring industry to work out solutions seems like a more efficient approach. 
*$300 million battery prize. Obama derides this as a gimmick, but McCain's idea for developing a radically better battery for powering a new generation of cars strikes us as smarter than more bureaucratic approaches. Like the X-Prize that helped propel the first civilian aircraft into space, a reward can leverage huge private investment. The idea would be better, though, if it focused on building radically more fuel-efficient cars regardless of the technology. 
It won't be hard to improve on the energy record of President Bush and his predecessors, but for the next president, standing still won't be an option. Whoever wins will benefit from stealing an idea or two from his opponent.

I'm for McCain, but not the GOP: The Republicans go awry -- and disgrace 'conservatism' -- when it comes to Big Oil.

Abstract 
I support John McCain for president. But that doesn't mean I support the Republican Party. Had the GOP nominated anyone else this year, I'd be struggling to rationalize a vote for the Democrats in November. I back McCain because we need integrity, experience and courage in our next president. I view the Democrats' candidate, Barack Obama, as a Ferrari without an engine, wonderfully shiny but with nothing under the hood.

support John McCain for president. But that doesn't mean I support the Republican Party. Had the GOP nominated anyone else this year, I'd be struggling to rationalize a vote for the Democrats in November. I back McCain because we need integrity, experience and courage in our next president. I view the Democrats' candidate, Barack Obama, as a Ferrari without an engine, wonderfully shiny but with nothing under the hood. 
Even so -- like many Americans -- I'm disgusted with both political parties. The Republicans have abandoned their principles while the Democrats have abandoned their senses. I believe that the Republicans get it right more often on foreign policy and security while the Democrats show more decency on domestic matters. Were it not for their alarming weakness on defense, I'd lean toward the Democrats now -- not least because of the Republican Party's slavish relationship with the energy industry. 
Among swing voters -- who'll decide this year's election -- I'm not alone in my disgust. As the fuel-cost crisis brakes our economy and plays havoc with family budgets, the Republican Party is determined to reward the very corporations that created this situation. Although it was in part a political stunt, the recent effort by congressional Democrats to hold energy companies responsible for the markets they dominate and to restrict unwarranted subsidies to Big Oil resonated with me. 
Exploiting ANWR 
Our longstanding avoidance of a responsible energy policy is, of course, a bipartisan disgrace. That said, the Bush administration has been, first and foremost, an oilman's administration. I'm infuriated by the Republicans' Manchurian-candidate response to every complaint about Big Oil's culpability in this energy crisis: "Drill ANWR!" Just open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for exploitation. 
This is as dishonest as money politics gets. First, it would take a decade, at least, to get ANWR oil flowing. Second, we'd get -- at most -- a two-year-equivalent supply out of a ravaged wilderness. Third, current laws would allow Big Oil to sell ANWR petroleum on the global market -- it could go into Chinese tanks as easily as into our own. 
But the even bigger scandal behind the "Drill ANWR!" mantra is that this administration has already issued a deluge of oil-and-gas development leases on public lands. According to the Interior Department numbers, industry already has the rights to 44 million acres. There aren't enough drilling rigs, heavy-equipment pools or operators to begin to cover the territory already given away. 
The oil and gas companies are getting all the papers signed that they can before a new administration takes office. Such leases are virtually impossible to revoke. Wherever they don't have the gear to drill or pipelines in place, those companies quickly carve roads across virgin lands: Once the roads are in, the ecological damage is underway, and there's no reverse gear. 
You don't hear much about this scandal because legislators from both parties back the giveaways (just follow the money). From New Mexico, up along the western slope of the Rockies, through Wyoming and Montana, our natural heritage is being ravaged for the future profits of the same corporations gouging American consumers today -- and that land is your land. 
I can't understand why conservatives aren't for conservation. You don't have to be an Al Gore acolyte to value America's landscape. We all should seek to be good stewards of the environment. How did the party of Teddy Roosevelt become the party of Bush-Cheney? 
This isn't about global-warming hysteria. This is just about being responsible citizens who do the right thing by our natural heritage and by one another. Clean air and a clean conscience make a pretty good platform. 
Compromise needed 
Yes, we need to make intelligent compromises. We need energy. Even so, industry must be accountable. We need new refineries, but Big Oil refrains from serious efforts to build them because limited refinery capacity is a handy excuse for maintaining high gas prices when they otherwise would fall. Offshore drilling -- coordinated with the states, as McCain proposes -- makes sense, but energy developers want to drill closer in because it's cheaper (kiss your beach goodbye). And yes, Virginia, there is clean coal-burning technology (developed at taxpayer expense), but power providers refuse to build non-polluting plants because of the set-up costs. 
Instead, we're told by march-in-step legislators that the only way to fix our energy woes is to sign over America's remaining wilderness to oil and gas multinationals. This is a lie so big that it echoes from the Rockies to the Arctic Circle. 
That's one more reason why I back McCain for president: He opposes the Republican establishment's eagerness to sign off on the wanton destruction of ANWR. He has the guts to take on Big Energy. He wants to reward innovators, not price-gougers. He has the honesty to state that non-polluting nuclear power will be part of the answer. He believes in sensible, sturdy conservation policies that balance our needs and our legacy. An outdoorsman from Arizona, McCain has long stood apart from his party in his defense of conservation measures, while Obama, from Southside Chicago, discovered environmentalism only when a national campaign made it convenient to be green. 
What else do I want in the next administration? A foreign policy that recognizes we really do have mortal enemies who must be resisted. A domestic policy that doesn't kneel to extremists on either end of the political spectrum. The reduction of pork-barrel spending, government waste and the deficit. And the recognition that capitalism is by far the best system -- but that capitalism needs adult supervision. 
I don't trust either party to deliver. But I trust John McCain.

Energy is spent to protect birds from threat of power lines

Abstract

Scientists are increasingly concerned about the number of birds killed by running into power lines and wind turbines, said Al Manville, a senior wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, but there are reports of success in preventing such incidents -- at least in the case of the power lines. 
More lines and turbines are planned in coming years, which could put several species of birds at risk, Manville said. 

"We've got to address our carbon footprint and deal with climate change," he said, "but we want to make sure, in the process, we don't create new problems." 
If a project taking place in the Dakotas is successful, researchers say, it could hold implications throughout the Central Flyway, a major bird migration route that stretches from 
the Dakotas to Texas. 

The study, underway near Coleharbor, N.D., by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Western Area Power Administration, involves placing "diverters" on power lines where 
large numbers of birds fly between two local lakes. The coil-like diverters are often brightly colored and designed to spin or move in the wind. They give birds a visual cue to 
avoid the line. 

To test the efficiency of the diverters, biologists collect and count the corpses of fallen birds beneath power lines. In 2006, before the diverters were in place, 429 dead birds 
were counted, said Misti Schriner, a biologist with the Western Area Power Administration. 

After the devices were put in place, 344 dead birds were collected in 2007. 
"I do believe there will be a decline," Schriner said. Final results won't be in for several months. Schriner noted that about 20% of the dead birds collected in this project were 
American coots, a common water bird. In central Nebraska, there are concerns about endangered whooping cranes and other species colliding with power lines near the Platte 
River, said Brad Mellema, director of the Iain Nicolson Audubon Center at the Rowe Sanctuary. 

Only about 260 whooping cranes -- enormous white birds with wingspans of up to 7 feet -- exist in the Central Flyway, he said. Diverters have been put on lines for about a 

year, and Mellema expects to learn more about their effectiveness in coming months. 
Researchers in San Joaquin County, Calif., are encouraged by a 60% reduction in bird fatalities after power lines were equipped with diverters, said Marcus Yee, whose findings 
were released in January. 

In Northern California, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found more than 1,000 raptors were killed annually by wind-power facilities there. The area includes one 

of the nation's largest concentrations of wind turbines in the Altamont Pass region. 
In West Virginia, more than 2,000 bats were killed in a seven-month period in an area with 44 wind turbines, according to the GAO report. Bats are the primary predator of 
many insects, including some crop-damaging bugs, said Mike Duran, a vertebrate zoologist with the Nature Conservancy. 

It was difficult for scientists to draw conclusions about wind power's impact on wildlife because deaths of birds and other wildlife vary greatly from one region to another, the 
GAO report states. 

Current research is important, because "birds play a key role in the ecosystem," said Greg Butcher, director of bird conservation at the National Audubon Society. 
"They serve as the canary in the coal mine," he said. "We find that if humans are doing things in the environment that are bad for birds, it's a good sign they're doing things 
that are bad for humans as well."

Abstract 
In Virginia, Potomac Edison, citing high coal and natural gas prices, plans to raise rates 29% on July 1, pushing an average monthly residential bill from about $70 to $90.

Here's a shocker: Electricity bills are heading up. Way up. 
Utilities across the USA are raising power prices up to 29%, mostly to pay for soaring fuel costs, but also to build new plants and refurbish an aging power grid. 
Even more dramatic rate increases are ahead. The mounting electric bills will further squeeze households struggling with spiraling gasoline prices. 
"Consumers now face a tough reality on electricity," says Mark Cooper of Consumer Federation of America. 
The increases come after rising fuel prices already have driven up utility bills nearly 30% in the past five years, the sharpest jump since the 1970s energy crisis. Fuel costs are again the main culprit. In Virginia, Potomac Edison, citing high coal and natural gas prices, plans to raise rates 29% on July 1, pushing an average monthly residential bill from about $70 to $90. AmerenUE, Missouri's largest utility, recently asked for its first rate increase in 20 years, a 12.1% boost, mostly to cover higher fuel costs. Customers of Public Service Co. of Oklahoma were socked with a 25% rise on June 1. 
The price of coal, which fires half of U.S. power plants, has doubled since last year, largely because of surging energy use in countries such as China and India. Natural gas prices are up nearly 50% on high U.S. demand. In California, drought has forced Pacific Gas & Electric to replace cheap hydroelectric power with natural gas, helping to prompt it to seek 13% rate increases. 
The cost to build a power plant has also gone up, more than doubling since 2000. South Carolina Electric & Gas wants to boost rates 37% by 2019 to cover its share of two nuclear reactors costing $10 billion. 
Some utilities are seeking several increases. In New York City, Con Edison, which raised rates 4.7% in April, seeks increases of 5% in each of the next three years to fund $5.5 billion in equipment after a 2006 Queens blackout. That's on top of an anticipated 13% rate increase this summer for higher fuel charges. "We must make sure that our system has the highest reliability," Con Ed spokesman Michael Clendenin says. 
Queens Assemblyman Michael Gianaris says Con Ed wasted funds on new plants elsewhere and urges regulators to reject the proposal. "I say not one penny more until reforms are done," he says. 
Expect bigger rate shocks if federal legislation, anticipated by 2010, passes and forces coal-fired generators to pay fees to emit global-warming gases. American Electric Power, the largest coal-fired generator, will have to raise rates 115% to pay higher fuel costs, build new plants and recover global-warming fees, says Hugh Wynne of Bernstein Research. Wynne says regulators could temper increases by trimming profits.

Alabama Stretching 631 miles from the Georgia state line to the Gulf of Mexico, the just-launched Alabama Scenic River Trail lets kayakers, canoers and motorboaters glide through 
scenic portions of nine lakes, seven rivers, two creeks and the USA's second-largest river delta. A flotilla will gather at Montgomery's Riverwalk for the June 6 dedication, and Paddle Alabama hosts group trips on portions of the trail through mid-July. 800-252-2262; alabamascenicrivertrail.com -- Laura Bly Arkansas Once part of two-time governor Winthrop Rockefeller's homestead and model cattle farm, the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute atop Petit Jean Mountain near Morrilton now 
welcomes individuals as well as groups. Guests can fish at Lake Abby, take in an art class or learn to cook with ingredients plucked from a demonstration garden that resembles what the mountain looked like when Rockefeller arrived in 1953. 866-972-7778; uawri.org -- Laura Bly 
Alaska Hikers, campers and cruise day-trippers can go farther into the Chugach National Forest southeast of Anchorage, thanks to "Whistle Stop" service on the Alaska Railroad. Cars can't reach iceberg-dotted Spencer Lake (with shutter-clicking views of the Spencer Glacier), but tourists now can, via a train that allows riders to hop on and off in the wilderness and take a new trail to the lake. Trains can be boarded at Anchorage, Portage, Girdwood and Whittier. Once in the back country, keep an eye out for brown bears and moose. 800-544-0552; alaskarailroad.com

XVI style for Alfred I. du Pont in 1910, boasts a world-class art collection and formal gardens modeled after those at Versailles. It's named for the French city from which the du Ponts emigrated and later made a fortune in chemicals. Alfred was on such uneasy terms with his family that it's said the estate's perimeter walls topped with glass shards were meant to keep them out. 302-651-6912; nemours mansion.org

-- Laura Bly Hawaii It has been a rocky ride for the Hawaii Superferry. Since late last summer, the ferry has launched, canceled and relaunched its inter-island passenger and vehicle service in the wake of local protests and high 
winter seas that earned it the nickname "barf barge." But the 866-seat Alakai recently added a second Honolulu-Maui trip four days a week, and its summer one-way promotional rate of $49 per passenger is competitive with advance-purchase airline fares. 877-443-3779; hawaiisuperferry.com -- Laura Bly Idaho 
The Famous Potatoes state is swingin' with the addition of two new courses to the Idaho Golf Trail.

The drilling boosted U.S. natural gas production 3% last year, helping reduce residential natural gas prices for heating and other uses 5.4%, the Energy Information Administration says. 

Full Text 
FORT WORTH -- Pastor Elvis Bowman of the Greater Mount Tabor Christian Center, an aging, homespun church in a low-income neighborhood here, has a new title: energy mogul. 
By letting Chesapeake Energy drill wells and pump natural gas from beneath its 50 acres, the church has pocketed tens of thousands of dollars and stands to clear tens of thousands more in royalties each month after drilling begins. The money will help pay for a new $8 million church and performance center, a $12 million mixed-use development nearby and a slate of community programs to help the less fortunate. 
"It's been an unexpected treasure," says Bowman, a preacher with a gravelly voice and infectious cackle. "I know without a doubt it was divine." 
In this sprawling city and surrounding area, companies are siphoning natural gas from under homes, churches, schools and golf courses in an urban drilling frenzy that's showering property owners with unexpected windfalls. The initiative takes another leap in a few months when drilling begins in Fort Worth's revitalized downtown. 
The region, the nation's most active drilling basin, is the epicenter of a natural gas boom rippling across the USA. Companies are boring wells in the unlikeliest of places, transforming large swaths of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, the Rockies, and, most recently, rural Pennsylvania. They're building a vast network of pipelines to transport the gas to population centers, tanks to store the surplus and terminals to house liquefied natural gas (LNG) from overseas. 
Much of the infrastructure is springing up in the Gulf of Mexico, which hasn't seen such a building flurry in decades, says Russell Braziel, managing director of Bentek Energy. In Texas, "They're drilling like banshees and finding gas like banshees," he says. "This is fabulous for the consumer." 
The drilling boosted U.S. natural gas production 3% last year, helping reduce residential natural gas prices for heating and other uses 5.4%, the Energy Information Administration says. 
Natural gas heats about half of U.S. homes and fuels 20% of U.S. power plants. It's also a feedstock for products such as plastics, fertilizer, antifreeze and fabrics. 
With oil prices soaring and coal losing favor amid concerns about global warming, natural gas has emerged as the fuel of choice in the USA. 
Natural gas prices have risen sharply in recent years. But the drilling boom, at least for now, is tempering consumers' costs as oil prices march toward $130 a barrel. The benchmark spot price of natural gas is about $11 for 1,000 cubic feet. That's far less expensive than oil, even allowing that it takes about 6,000 cubic feet of gas to match a barrel of oil's energy output, measured in British thermal units (Btu). 
Driving the U.S. appetite for gas is the power industry. Coal fires 50% of power plants, but it's the largest emitter of global-warming gases. 
Most utilities are turning to natural gas generators that emit half as much carbon dioxide, are relatively inexpensive to build and can be finished quickly. Natural gas use by the power industry grew 10% last year. 
The surging demand, along with 2005 hurricanes that shut down production facilities in the Gulf, helped push up prices in recent years. Since 2002, natural gas prices have more than tripled. 
Here's the good news: The rising prices have enticed companies to unearth new supplies, moderating price hikes. Analyst Robert Ineson of Cambridge Energy Research Associates expects natural gas prices to fall to $8 per 1,000 cubic feet later this year and hover at about $7 through 2012. 
Several years ago, with recoverable natural gas reserves being depleted in traditional fields such as the Gulf, the industry started scrambling. Companies such as Sempra Energy began planning terminals to accept LNG from overseas. 
At the same time, as natural gas prices crept past $6 per 1,000 cubic feet, it became economical for companies to develop new drilling methods to extract gas deeply embedded in formations of shale rock. Rigs drill down about 7,000 feet, then make a right angle and bore horizontally up to 5,000 feet, exposing about 10 times as much rock. Workers free trapped gas by pumping in water to form cracks in the shale and sand to hold the fissures open, letting gas flow up. 
"It's made millions of acres productive," says Chesapeake Energy spokesman Jim Gipson. 
In Fort Worth, horizontal drilling has allowed rigs to be placed up to a mile from neighborhoods where gas will be tapped. Nearly 1,000 wells have been drilled in the city, the heart of a 5,000-square-mile basin, known as the Barnett Shale, that skirts Dallas. Like mini-Eiffel Towers, the 130-foot-tall latticework rigs can occasionally be spotted around town, emitting an airplane-engine hum punctuated by screeches and periodic clouds of smoke. More common are the 6-foot-high wellheads that remain after drilling is done in about 30 days. Billboards exhort commuters to "Explore the Barnett Shale." 
"I've never seen a development of this magnitude in an urban area," says Larry Dale, CEO of Dale Resources, a production company that leases property in Fort Worth for 
Chesapeake. 
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport sports five rigs after leasing the right to drill on its 18,000 acres for $186 million plus royalties. The city of Fort Worth expects to rake in 
about $1 billion in the next 20 years for leasing its property. Property owners these days typically get a signing bonus of at least $17,000 per acre and 25% of monthly revenue. 

"It has, indeed, floated everyone's boat higher," says Fort Worth Mayor Mike Moncrief. 
Across town, the Barnett Shale -- which surrenders 3 billion cubic feet of gas a day, 5% of U.S. consumption -- inevitably seeps into conversations. As Pastor Bowman concludes 

a visit with Maureen and R.V. Castle, who live across the street in a small clapboard house, Maureen exclaims, "I want to see that hole in the ground so I can see that (new) 
church going up!" 
Denise and Lloyd Stephens, who leased the mineral rights under their southwest Fort Worth house, plan to invest the $4,200 signing bonus into their direct-sales nutrition 

business. The $150 or so they expect to earn in monthly royalties will help pay their property taxes. "We were thrilled," Denise says. "This was pennies from heaven. God put shale below us." 
Not everyone's happy 
The drilling has also rankled some. Two wells were drilled about 600 feet from the backyard of Brenda and Gary Hogan. "Twenty-four hours a day you've got noise and bright 
lights," as well as a parade of trucks that deliver and pick up water, Brenda says. 

The rigs are gone now, but when the Hogans look past their backyard to a once-bucolic pasture, they see two round green tanks that separate the gas from water. Noting they 

earned just a $550 signing leasing bonus and expect about $50 a month in royalties, Gary adds, "It's not worth it." 
Elsewhere, companies are borrowing Texas drilling techniques to tap an even bigger potential bounty in an Appalachian Mountain rock called the Marcellus Shale. Since 2004, 
about 35 companies have spent $4billion drilling in a region encompassing Pennsylvania, western New York, Ohio and West Virginia, at first with little success. 

In the past six months, Range Resources, the No.1 player in the area, has hit 10 good wells in Pennsylvania, revitalizing the effort, says Range CEO John Pinkerton. Bonuses to lease land from farmers and others in the largely rural area have risen to $2,500 an acre from $300 in February, says Tom Murphy of the Penn State cooperative extension. Penn State geologists estimate the Marcellus contains at least 100 trillion cubic feet of gas in a 53,000-square-mile area, about four times the Barnett basin's and enough to supply the USA for about five years. 
The Marcellus is especially valuable because it's in the Northeast, where a pipeline bottleneck has constrained supplies and nudged up natural gas prices. 
To distribute all the new reserves, the industry is ramping up construction of pipelines to ferry gas to population centers. Last year, a record 14.5 billion cubic feet of pipeline 
capacity was added in the USA, the EIA says. Much of it transports gas from Texas to a Louisiana hub where it's dispersed to the Southeast, Northeast and Midwest. 
Kinder Morgan, Sempra Energy and ConocoPhillips are building a $5 billion, 1,679-mile line from the Rocky Mountains basin in Colorado to Clarington, Ohio. 
It's the largest pipeline project in the continental USA in the past 25 years. The Rockies Express, slated to be fully operating early next year, will largely carry gas to New York 

and other Northeast markets. 
The increased flow will likely come at the expense of Western residents. As production ramped up in the Rockies last year without a similar increase in pipeline capacity, natural 

gas prices in Colorado fell as low as a nickel per 1,000 cubic feet, enough gas to heat an average house for two days. That led to a 20% drop in heating bills for customers of 
Xcel Energy, says spokesman Mark Stutz. But the opening of new pipelines has pushed local prices higher, and the Rockies Express could mean another 35% surge next winter. 
Gaps in demand that can't be met by domestic reserves are supposed to be filled by LNG imports. In countries with plentiful supplies, such as Qatar and Angola, natural gas is 

chilled to minus 260 degrees, turning it into a liquid that's shipped overseas in tankers in 1/600th of the space. Shipments go to terminals in Asia, Europe and the USA that store the liquid in huge stainless-steel tanks, then convert it back to gas that's pumped into pipelines. The USA has long had four terminals, and LNG makes up 3% of U.S. gas supplies. 
Foreseeing depleted domestic reserves, companies a few years ago planned a flurry of new LNG ports. Four opened recently and three more are slated by the end of 2009. 
Another 40 or so have been proposed; only a handful are expected to be built. 
Changed outlook 

Several years ago, EIA expected LNG to make up 20% of U.S. gas supplies by 2025. But that forecast has been halved, and little LNG is being delivered. 
Terminals are at 50% capacity and expected to remain there for several years, partly because high building costs have discouraged construction of overseas liquefaction 
facilities, Ineson says. Also, producers are shipping most LNG to Asia and Europe, where customers are paying up to double U.S. rates. 

The situation can partly be blamed on the domestic plenty. Abundant U.S. supplies should continue to temper prices and make it tough to attract LNG imports, says analyst Bob 

Linden of Pace Energy. 
The low prices are also deterring energy giants from planning enough LNG production plants overseas, Ineson says. That could lead to a crunch, and higher prices, by 2013, 
when U.S. thirst for natural gas is likely to outpace domestic stock and there won't be enough LNG to bridge the gap. 

"The surprise is that LNG is not turning out to be as big as we expected," Ineson says. "But domestic supply is turning out to be better." TEXT WITHIN GRAPHIC BEGINS HERE Open for drilling Drill sites Can be as close as 600 feet from the nearest dwelling,

Wells Drilled by attaching a multi-head drill bit to 31-foot lengths of steel pipe, about 4.5 inches in diameter. Average vertical drill depth in the Barnett Shale is 8,000 feet, or 1.5 miles. Bending the pipe As the well bore approaches a shale layer containing natural gas, the direction of the drill bit is gradually changed by steering it from the rig's control center. The underground drill pipe can turn because it flexes under its own tremendous weight. It takes 500 to 600 feet for a drill to make a 90-degree turn. On-site production How natural gas drill sites are set up and operated: Access road and pad are constructed on 2 to 5 acres of land; drilling rig is moved in and assembled. 3 to 4 weeks: Well is drilled in 24­hour-per-day operation; drilling rig is disassembled and moved to next location. 1 week: Water mixed with sand is pumped into the well pipe under high pressure. The shale layer is fractured, or cracked; sand keeps the cracks open, releasing more gas. 1 to 3 weeks: Production valves, storage tanks and access pipelines connecting to larger 
transmission systems are installed, area landscaped, fenced and monitored. After 20 to 30 years of operation: Well is permanently sealed and the equipment removed, and the land is available for other uses. 5,000 feet 500 feet New techniques allow companies to drill a vertical well, bore horizontally and crack shale to extract natural gas nearly a mile away. Now companies can economically drill for natural gas with fewer holes and reduced environmental harm from previously inaccessible locations, such as far below the Dallas/Fort Worth airport.

WASHINGTON -- John McCain heads to the Pacific Northwest today to propose a climate-change plan, addressing an issue integral to his presidential bid in a region that could be crucial. 
The Arizona senator, who often cites climate change as a policy difference with President Bush, plans to renew support for a "cap-and-trade" system that "sets clear limits on all greenhouse gases, while also allowing the sale of rights to excess emissions," according to excerpts of his speech released Sunday. 
McCain is scheduled to speak at a wind power facility in Portland, Ore. "The facts of global warming demand our urgent attention, especially in Washington," McCain says in the prepared remarks. 
McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate, plans to propose a series of goals for reduction of carbon emissions, ending at 60% below 1990 levels by the year 2050. 
A cap-and-trade system would "change the dynamic of our energy economy," McCain says in the prepared remarks. It would encourage industry to adopt or develop cleaner forms of energy, such as wind, solar, nuclear and "clean coal." 
After a day in Oregon, McCain also is scheduled to discuss the environment Tuesday in Washington state. Those states are among those "being discussed as target states" for the fall campaign, said Tucker Bounds, a McCain campaign spokesman. 
A native of Oregon, Bounds said voters there like politicians who work with members of the other party. "They tend to be more independent, much more in the framework of John McCain," he said. 
The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, is challenging McCain's credentials as an environmentalist. It developed a list of McCain supporters who have lobbied for oil companies or run companies that have been cited for pollution. DNC Chairman Howard Dean said in a statement that McCain would "appoint right-wing judges bent on gutting environmental regulations." 
As a senator, McCain has long backed cap-and-trade legislation. The idea is that companies that exceed emissions caps could buy credits from those that pollute less, giving them time to develop cleaner technologies without cutting production. 
Bush has warned that government-imposed restrictions would hurt the U.S. economy. The administration has sponsored meetings among the world's major polluters to work out voluntary plans to reduce heat-trapping emissions. 
During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, McCain talked about his differences with the Bush administration, citing climate change along with increases in federal spending and "the failed strategy that was employed in the war in Iraq." Democrats have repeatedly tried to link McCain to the unpopular Republican president. 
Bush and McCain do agree on some environmental and energy items. Both support the increased use of nuclear power. Both also say any global climate-change agreement should include China and India, major polluters as well as international economic competitors. 
In the prepared remarks, McCain says that if China and India refuse to participate in an international solution to global warming, he would work with other governments to impose some sort of "cost equalization mechanism" on those nations. 
Environmental organizations said McCain deserves credit for his cap-and-trade proposals, but some called them inadequate in face of the threats posed by global warming. One group, the League of Conservation Voters, said McCain has a congressional career score of 24% on environmental issues. In a statement, Gene Karpinski, the group's president, said it appears that McCain "hopes to use global warming and the environment to distance himself from the Bush administration," but given McCain's record, "that distance can be measured in inches."

China leaves U.S. in dust as the No. 1 CO2 offender

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- China has overtaken the USA to become the world's No. l industrial source of carbon dioxide, the most important global-warming pollutant, according to a 
scientific study to be published today. 
The study and two others -- one recently published and another coming -- agree that China's carbon-dioxide emissions surpassed those in the USA in 2006. That's decades 
earlier than had been predicted by the International Energy Agency four years ago. 

All three studies examine emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal. Energy usage is the most significant man-made source of carbon dioxide, 

which accumulates in the atmosphere and traps heat. 
Unless China sharply cuts its emissions, "the situation is pretty bleak," says Richard Carson of the University of California, co-author of a study in today's Journal of 
Environmental Economics and Management. "There's a lot less time to do something than people previously thought." 

China's total emissions in 2006 roughly tied U.S. emissions, according to another study in the April 24 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. But China's monthly production of carbon dioxide overtook the USA's in mid-2006, the study says. "Nobody could anticipate the rate of growth that's taken place in the last six or eight years in China," says Gregg Marland of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the authors of that study. 
Predictions about when China would overtake the USA were wrong because of China's "shocking" growth in energy-hungry industries, including cement and steel production, says Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researcher Mark Levine. 
Levine and a co-worker at the laboratory produced a study that will appear in July's issue of Annual Review of Environment and Resources. It is available online now. 
Carson and Levine said they aren't aware of any similar studies published in academic journals. The Dutch government and the International Energy Agency said last year that 
China had surpassed the USA in carbon-dioxide emissions. 

Each group relied on different methods and data sources, among them the United Nations, the Chinese environmental agency and the U.S. Geological Survey. 

Earlier in his administration, President Bush cited Chinese emissions as one reason to end U.S. participation in a treaty to curb global warming by developed nations. China is 
not a party to the treaty. 
The ascension of China to No. 1 polluter makes it more likely that global-warming legislation in Congress will include protection for U.S. industries, says Robert Stavins of 

Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. For example, Congress could impose import penalties on nations that haven't taken steps to control emissions. 
Such "a provision could lead to a trade war" with China, Stavins says. 
China's new status might provide fodder to opponents of U.S. attempts to address global warming, says Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Select Committee on 

Energy Independence and Global Warming. 
Instead, he says, it should add "to the urgency of the United States becoming a leader."

The Sheboygan (Wis.) Press, in an editorial: "Much of the debate this Earth Day centers on whether global warming is real or not. Many scientists ... maintain that man is causing the atmosphere to heat up, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels -- coal for power plants and gasoline in cars and trucks. ... Other scientists ... say the earth is merely going through a normal cycle. ... Eventually, the cycle will shift to one of global cooling. While Earth Day is as good a time as any to continue the global warming debate, fact is, you don't have to subscribe to the global warming theory in order to take steps to preserve the environment. The idea that what can be good for the air we breathe and the water we drink is also good for our pocketbook is a sound one. ... Using energy efficient electrical appliances reduces ... the monthly electric bill. ... Eventual use of alternative and renewable sources of energy (will) reduce dependence on foreign oil and can boost the U.S. economy." 
Orlando Sentinel, in an editorial: "How much impact can one American household have by switching from incandescent to compact fluorescent light bulbs when China is bringing two coal-fired electric plants on line every week? It's the age-old question posed in the face of so many seemingly impossible situations, whether it is in fighting poverty, combating homelessness ... or even just voting: What can one person do? ... If being a responsible steward of the earth is the right thing to do, it is worth doing for its own sake. There isn't a religion or major philosophy on the planet that teaches right action is required only if the outcome can be known in advance." 
Nancy Spence, Colorado state senator, for The Denver Post: "Now that climate change is on magazine covers and being debated by presidential candidates, the question is what kind of policy both Republicans and Democrats will support. It will have to be a policy that actually cuts the carbon pollution that is believed to contribute to climate change and creates new opportunities for workers and businesses. ... Bipartisan leaders are coming forward to cut pollution that may contribute to global warming. ... America's Climate Security Act, which would create a national cap-and-trade system (on greenhouse emissions) ... is something Republicans and Democrats alike can support on Earth Day and throughout the years ahead." 
The Oregonian, in an editorial: "Greenwashing, like its cousin whitewashing, is a form of deception. ... 2008 ... may be remembered as the election cycle that turned greenwashing into a campaign survival strategy. Suddenly, as never before, candidates of all political stripes are uttering words such as 'hybrids,' 'renewable.' ... This rhetoric, much of it insincere, reflects a powerful shift. ... Growing numbers of Americans, and not just on the political left, are increasingly concerned about global warming. ... Thus the challenge for us ... lies in distinguishing the sincerely green candidates from the ... fakes. Global warming isn't the only crushing issue, of course, but it's a big one, requiring voters to weigh some tough questions." 
Bill Maher, for The Huffington Post: "New Rule: From now on, Earth Day really must be a year-round thing. And in honor of this Earth Day, starting Monday supermarket clerks must stop putting the big bottle of detergent with a handle on it in a plastic bag. I don't mean to tell you how to do your job, but you see that handle you just lifted the detergent with? I can use that same handle to carry the detergent to my car. And stop putting my liquor in a smaller paper sack before you put it in the big paper sack with my other stuff. What, are you afraid my groceries will think less of me if they see I've been drinking? Trust me, the broccoli doesn't care. ... Americans throw out 100 billion plastic bags a year, and they all take a thousand years to decompose. Your children's children's children's children will never know you, but they'll know you once bought batteries at the 99 cent store because the bag will still be caught in the tree. Except there won't be trees."

Abstract 
BBC's Natural History Unit has begun filming Frozen Planet, a sequel of sorts to last year's 11-episode hit Earth, exploring the wildlife and extremely sparse human populations of Antarctica and the Arctic Circle. 

Full Text 
Correction ran 4/10/2008: A story Wednesday on the BBC project Frozen Planet misstated the natural habitat of the polar bear. Polar bears live in the Arctic. 
The makers of Planet Earth are diving into their next expedition: the icy reaches of the North and South poles. 
BBC's Natural History Unit has begun filming Frozen Planet, a sequel of sorts to last year's 11-episode hit Earth, exploring the wildlife and extremely sparse human populations 

of Antarctica and the Arctic Circle. The eight-hour project will take more than two years to complete and is estimated to cost more than $16 million. 
But don't set your DVRs: It will arrive on the U.K.'s BBC in fall 2011 and won't surface on the Discovery Channel until spring 2012. 
In working on Earth, says series producer Vanessa Berlowitz, it became clear this type of habitat bore closer scrutiny. "Normal wildlife film crews struggled to follow them 

because it's really quite dangerous," she says. 
And global warming threatens to erode the environment, making the polar quest more urgent, Berlowitz says. Even during the three to four years it took to film Planet Earth, 

"there was such dramatic change in each of the locations we were working in, the ice was so diminished, we could see that this was a habitat in crisis, and this might be our last chance to see it," she says. Discovery Channel president John Ford says the project will offer an extraordinarily detailed look at habits and animals in regions that few have seen. "We're focusing on the 
greatest wilderness left on Earth where really many people just can't live." 
Ford says the effects of melting ice on habitats there might prove "the canary in the coal mine to tell us whether we're heading for trouble elsewhere on the planet." 
Already, the team has filmed a population of eider ducks flying over the ice near Alaska, searching for feeding holes, and in Antarctica, they've followed polar bears in hunting 

season. 

Producers are using an advanced version of an Axsys Cineflex, a helicopter-mounted high-definition camera used in Earth that withstands extreme cold temperatures up to 30 below zero and remains steady and films at long ranges without disturbing wildlife. The special will air in four consecutive two-hour Sunday installments. It will include an hour exploring each of the four seasons, using time-lapse photography; an hour on 
humans at the poles, both ancient civilizations and explorers now "wearing flip-flops and living in greenhouses," Berlowitz says. A final hour will go behind the scenes to show how the film was made. 
But the project has its challenges. 
"We thought Planet Earth was hard, but this is like another league," she says. Papua New Guinea at least had its indigenous populations, but "the kinds of places we want to go, 
there's absolutely nothing there. It's like the early explorers -- every shot is mounting a massive expedition." 

Cameras will go under the ice, to polar caves in high mountain ranges and to active volcanoes in Antarctica. Filmmakers gained rare access to remote regions of Russia, and 

NASA satellite imagery will offer a detailed look at both poles. 
Planet Earth, which followed 2002 special Blue Planet, was a big success, averaging about 6 million viewers on its initial Discovery run. The channel says 65 million U.S. viewers 
saw some part of the special, which will next be repeated in October. BBC has sold 2 million DVDs in the USA, and Discovery's version sold 600,000, the top-selling title in the 
channel's history.

Abstract 
Low-cost, long-life lithium batteries are seen as essential for accelerated development of alternative-power vehicles, ranging from the now-familiar gasoline-electric hybrids that double normal fuel economy to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles that use no petroleum. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) -- still in the prototype stage and not on sale -- would bridge the gap, running on battery power at least a few miles before requiring help from the gasoline engine. 

Full Text 
NEW YORK -- Mercedes-Benz says it will have a demonstration fleet of practical, if small, electric vehicles on the road in two to three years. 
They're expected to run 80 miles or more on lithium-ion batteries the German automaker is developing. Regular production could begin a few years later. 
The announcement follows its declaration earlier this month that it will be first in the U.S. market with a gasoline-electric hybrid using a lithium battery pack. 
Together they suggest significant progress in lithium battery development -- a breakthrough, Mercedes unabashedly says. 
Lithium batteries, common in cellphones and laptop computers, are significantly more powerful for their size and weight than other types of batteries. But scaling up for auto 

use introduces new challenges. 

Low-cost, long-life lithium batteries are seen as essential for accelerated development of alternative-power vehicles, ranging from the now-familiar gasoline-electric hybrids that 
double normal fuel economy to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles that use no petroleum. 
As automakers compete to make such models more practical, using their own interpretations of Mercedes' backpack-size lithium battery, costs should drop. That would mean 

you might be able, sooner and cheaper than expected, to buy a car that gets extraordinary mileage, and perhaps directly uses no gasoline at all. 

The first-to-market Mercedes hybrid using lithium-ion batteries will be a gasoline-electric version of its S-class sedan in 2009. Its V-6 gasoline engine, helped by an electric 
motor, will feel like a V-8 but use less fuel. 
A key hurdle to using auto-scale lithium batteries is that they require careful temperature management and monitoring of the charge in each individual cell. 
Mercedes says it has solved those issues for the hybrid batteries and hopes to say the same soon for a different version needed for its pure electric car based on its Smart brand 

of tiny two-seaters. 

"Our plan in the next two to three years is to have a test fleet of Smart electric vehicles," Mercedes engineer and Vice President Herbert Kohler, who heads advanced powertrain 
operations, said in an interview at the auto show here. He said it would take several years to be sure the setup is right for mass production. 
"To show a demonstration fleet is easy. To do series production is a different matter," says Thomas Weber, member of the Mercedes board of management who's in charge of 

research and development. 

Even though Mercedes expects to be first with hybrids using lithium-ion batteries, General Motors aims to be first to field a showroom-ready pure electric vehicle using lithium. 
Its Chevrolet Volt two-seater is planned for late 2010 or 2011, priced about $35,000. 
Unlike gas-electric hybrids, electric cars such as Volt and the Smart will be propelled entirely by an electric motor running on batteries. They can be recharged by plugging into 

an outlet for six hours or more. 

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) -- still in the prototype stage and not on sale -- would bridge the gap, running on battery power at least a few miles before requiring 
help from the gasoline engine. 
Lithium batteries' extra storage capacity would allow PHEVs to go farther before needing help from their gasoline engines. PHEVs, like electric cars, can be recharged by 

plugging into an electric outlet. 

PHEVs and electric cars need more robust lithium batteries than conventional hybrids, because the batteries undergo a more severe duty cycle, charged to the brim then nearly 
drained. 
Even as it pushes ahead on the electric Smart cars, Mercedes says it isn't sure rechargeable batteries cut pollution or energy use. "You have to produce the energy" for 

recharging, and that might come from inefficient, higher-polluting sources, Kohler cautions. 
The benefit of plug-ins has been oversold, he says: "It is a very good marketing argument for the energy supply side. EPRI did that very well." 

EPRI is the Electric Power Research Institute. It published a study last July, paid for mainly by utilities that sell electricity, showing that PHEVs overall and over time are an environmental benefit. The same analysis, however, projects that in 2010, rechargeable vehicles' use of utilities' power could create from 1% to 11% more greenhouse gases than would be created by conventional hybrids. 
Greenhouse gases collectively are blamed by many for global warming. 
Toyota Motor is expanding lithium battery development and production, but also has concerns. At the Detroit auto show in January, Toyota President Katsuaki Wantanabe said: "We must address the energy challenges surrounding the use of advanced vehicles. Is the power grid we use produced by coal, or wind?" 
The government says that 2.4% of U.S. electricity is generated by wind and other non-polluting renewable sources, while 49% comes from coal-burning generators. The data do not specify how much of the coal-fired power comes from coal plants with or without the most sophisticated emissions controls. 
Meanwhile, work on lithium batteries for advanced electric vehicles continues. 
Mercedes says the key to practical auto-scale lithium batteries is a combination of technologies that the car company says address cooling, the batteries' Achilles' heel. Mercedes taps the vehicle's air conditioning system for chilled liquid to regulate the battery pack's temperature and uses special components within the battery pack to draw heat from the cells. Kohler says Mercedes considers cooling mandatory to safe and reliable long-term use of lithium batteries, whether in a hybrid or a pure electric car. 
Mercedes' lithium batteries will come from a new factory in France, operated by JCS. That's a joint venture between U.S. components supplier Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft. 
Demand could cut the cost and hasten development of the promising batteries, but predicting demand for battery-reliant cars depends on a key question, Weber says: "How cheaply can we bring the technology?"

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
On Monday, Lt. Gov. David Paterson became New York's first black governor ("Paterson takes office as N.Y. governor," Nationline, News, Monday). 
Paterson is working to get New York back on track and move former governor Elliot Spitzer and the New York Legislature's proposal on income tax to conclusion. He also, 
however, must begin to fund the critical needs of the state's public education system and, more important, the state's special education programs and services. 
Paterson has the opportunity to address the greatest civil rights issue of our time -- the inequities in public education for New York and our nation's students with disabilities. 
Paterson can be New York's "education governor" in 2008. 
Who knows where this amazing man, the nation's first legally blind governor, can go from the governor's office. 
I think the nation's 6 million children with disabilities and their parents would like to find out.

Energy solutions 
USA TODAY's editorial "Pleading is not a policy" argued that confronting our nation's energy challenges requires a suite of policy actions, including "additional domestic oil and 

gas production in Alaska and U.S. coastal waters," and "greater investment in energy technologies"(March 13). I couldn't agree more. 

Indeed, as so many American families and small-business owners struggle with record-high energy prices, we must continue to work aggressively to diversify the energy options 
available to us. 
But I strongly disagree with USA TODAY's suggestion that the Bush administration's strategy has amounted to little more than fruitless pleading to the Organization of Petroleum 

Exporting Countries. Under President Bush's leadership, we have put in place a series of federal policies to break our dependence on fossil fuels, improve our energy efficiency 
and harness the power of alternative fuels and renewable energy technologies. 
Since the start of this administration, the federal government has spent more than $12 billion to research, develop and promote alternative energy sources. 

Over the past year alone, the Energy Department has announced more than $1 billion of investments to spur the growth of a robust, sustainable biofuels industry. 
The federal government continues to make critical investments in solar and wind power, hydrogen fuel cell technologies, plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as cutting-edge clean-
coal plants and the advanced nuclear power technologies that must be part of our energy mix. The list could go on and on. 

This work has been underway for years and must continue. After all, the United States' energy challenges have been decades in the making and will not be solved overnight. 

Our national strategy is not merely a reaction to high oil prices. It's a committed policy that seeks to address two of the most fundamental challenges we face: improving our 
energy security and addressing global climate change. 
Today's high energy prices only underscore the urgency of these efforts.

Abstract 
Scientists have tied climate change to the release of heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases into the atmosphere, fueled by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal. A new Office of Sustainability has opened at the school -- similar offices are up and running or coming online at many others -- and the school's new student center is the first to receive the LEED Gold designation from the U.S. Green Building Council for exemplary environmental design and construction.

A youthquake of activism is hitting college campuses as students -- armed with cellphones, lots of contacts and political savvy -- tackle global warming. 
Plans have begun at campuses across the nation to implement initiatives discussed in "Focus the Nation," a national teach-in on the climate that took place in late January. 
Almost 2,000 schools and faith and civic institutions, and about 75 national and state political leaders were part of the event. Organizers say about 1 million people participated. 
"This is not a protest movement. It's an engagement movement," says Eban Goodstein, the economics professor at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore., who founded the 

non-profit organization, also called Focus the Nation, in 2006 to spearhead climate activism. 

At the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, "everyone's looking at what's our next step," says junior Katelyn McCormick. "People are planning campaigns. Freshmen are really excited." McCormick was among the students who gathered in Washington, D.C., in November for Powershift 2007, the first national youth summit on the climate crisis. At a special 
congressional hearing chaired by U.S. Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., McCormick spoke about how schoolchildren in West Virginia are affected by proximity to a coal-mining operation. 
Scientists have tied climate change to the release of heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases into the atmosphere, fueled by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal. 
"Global warming, environmental injustices and social injustices are so closely tied together that you can't separate one from another," McCormick says. "I definitely have found 
my passion and plan to make this part of my life." 

Lindsay Clark, a 2007 graduate, works at the Office of Sustainability at the University of Utah, which fosters eco-friendly programs. She says she is helping the school become a 
"net zero water campus" by recycling water and increasing its use of renewable energy. The school has an extensive energy-retrofitting program, which includes energy-efficient 
light bulbs and low-flow water fixtures. 

As a follow-up to the national event, Clark and other students met with Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, and pressed him to support the Higher Education Sustainability Act, which is 

now being considered by Congress. That legislation would require campuses to go green in their use of energy, materials and facilities. 
At the University of Vermont, more than 85 people took part in Focus the Nation, says Samir Doshi, a doctoral student. A new Office of Sustainability has opened at the school -­similar offices are up and running or coming online at many others -- and the school's new student center is the first to receive the LEED Gold designation from the U.S. Green 
Building Council for exemplary environmental design and construction. 

"A lot of people, when they talk about global warming, there's a lot of gloom and doom. We wanted to make it something positive," Doshi says. 
Many professors and faculty members embraced the teach-in, weaving discussions into their class schedules and taking part in panels. 
Goodstein and other activists see faculty involvement as a partnership between old-guard activists from the 1960s and the new "self-broadcasting" generation. 
"You've got the old-school people in the movement who fought in the civil rights movement. And you've got these instinctually brilliant young people who know how to organize, 

who know how to broadcast, because they already organize every day when they look for friends (on Facebook or MySpace)," says Garett Brennan, spokesman for Focus the 
Nation. 
Students also have used some more offbeat approaches. 

At the University of Missouri, northward relocation of hop crops because of warmer climates inspired a "Save the Ales" night at a local brew pub. 
"If you tell them that over the next 30 years the price of beer will really go up because of climate change, they stop and listen," says Lindsey Berger, a Missouri junior. "That's 
one thing that will grab their attention." 

'Project Slingshot' takes aim at solutions 
Focus the Nation is offering three "Project Slingshot" grants of up to $10,000 for the best green ideas in each of three categories. They must be ones that the applicants can "slingshot" into reality." The deadline for e-mail submissions is Saturday. The contest categories: 
*Outdoor fanatics protecting the places we love to play: Projects should be inspired by the need to protect outdoor spaces such as rivers, oceans and mountains. 
*Innovators challenging our expectations: Projects should challenge the status quo with new and creative thinking and include an action element to bring new thinking into action. 
*Artists inspiring our communities: Projects should use the arts to increase awareness of or change thinking about global warming solutions. 
Applicants should submit their ideas by Saturday.

The three winners will be announced on Earth Day, April 22.

It may not have the panache of a Toyota Prius or the sizzle of the Academy Awards bid to "go green." 
But the USA is quietly opening a more significant front this week in the battle against global warming by targeting its biggest source: power plants. 
A Wisconsin coal-fired power plant operated by We Energies is scheduled to launch a pilot project to capture a portion of the carbon dioxide produced as the coal is burned. It 

will be the first time a U.S. power plant has corralled CO2, the main greenhouse gas, before it floats out of the smokestack. 
Power plants produce nearly 40% of U.S. carbon emissions; the bulk of that is from coal plants. 
The project is a small step on a long road. Alstom, the technology provider, will capture just 3% of the carbon and will immediately release it rather than storing it underground. 

Carbon storage is widely deemed the biggest hurdle in the worldwide effort to reduce power plant CO2 emissions. 
Yet, the pilot program shows that even though the Bush administration recently canceled the clean coal plant called FutureGen, industry is forging ahead, if in a more 

scattershot style, to strike at the single biggest source of carbon discharges. The Pleasant Prairie, Wis., trial is one of a series of carbon-capture projects Alstom and others are 
planning at power plants around the nation in the next decade. 
The year-long effort, estimated to cost at least $10 million, is being funded by We Energies, Alstom, the Electric Power Research Institute and 35 companies. 
"It's a necessary first step," says Robert Hilton, head of business development for Alstom's global environmental business. 
Clean coal plants are viewed as vital to fighting global warming. Gas-fired plants emit far less carbon than coal, but natural gas prices are volatile. Wind and solar power are 

intermittent. Nuclear reactors are emissions-free but pricey and could take many years to build. Despite recent price increases, coal is fairly cheap and abundant. 
At the Wisconsin plant, Alstom has built a 90-foot-high addition criss-crossed by huge pipes and heat exchangers to capture the carbon, using a process called chilled ammonia. 

After coal is burned in a boiler, ammonium carbonate absorbs about 90% of the resulting CO2 to form ammonium bicarbonate, a solid and liquid. The carbon will then be separated under high pressure and released into the air as a gas. Chilling the carbon and other flue gases eliminates contaminants, such as sulfur dioxide, and permits a much greater amount of carbon to be absorbed, Hilton says. That means 
the carbon capture uses far less electricity, freeing the power for the grid. 
One concern about ammonia is its volatility. "You don't want it coming up the stack," says Howard Herzog, principal research engineer for the MIT Energy and Environment lab. 
Hilton says scrubbers will prevent any ammonia from escaping. 
The Wisconsin pilot program will be followed by similar but larger trials by Alstom at American Electric Power plants in West Virginia and Oklahoma. Those projects will store 

CO2 underground or pump it to oil fields to boost output. 
Alstom has said carbon capture and storage should be widely available by 2019. 
By capturing CO2 after it is produced, Alstom's technology can be used with hundreds of today's traditional pulverized coal plants, Hilton says. General Electric and Siemens are 

developing technology for a new type of plant that turns coal into synthetic gases, filtering out the CO2 before the gases are burned, a simpler process. 
Such plants are 20% cheaper than traditional coal plants, assuming both types add carbon capture and storage, says MIT professor John Deutch. 
The FutureGen plant, scheduled to be built in Mattoon, Ill., would have used gasification technology. The Department of Energy canceled it last month, citing construction costs 

that would have pushed its price tag to nearly $2 billion, most of which the DOE would have funded. Instead, the DOE says it will help fund several smaller gasification plants 

spearheaded by the power industry around the country. 
Deutch says only the federal government can oversee the challenging task of burying carbon in rock formations. Researchers must ensure that the carbon doesn't contaminate 
water supplies, and officials must determine who is liable if the CO2 leaks to neighboring properties, he says. 

Hilton, however, thinks Deutch is underestimating private efforts. "Sometimes government programs prolong a product coming to market," he says.

Abstract 
If large numbers of plug-in hybrids were being recharged with power from the least-sophisticated coal plants, "There is a possibility for significant increases of soot and mercury," says a report by environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council. 

Full Text 
The expected introduction of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles could cut U.S. gasoline use but could increase deadly air pollution in some areas, two reports say. 
That's because a plug-in's lower tailpipe emissions may be offset by smokestack emissions from the utility generating plants supplying electricity to recharge the big batteries that allow plug-ins to run up to 40 miles without kicking on their gasoline engines. Plug-ins, called PHEVs, are partly powered, in effect, by the fuel used to generate the electricity. 
About 49% of U.S. electricity is generated using coal, so in some regions a plug-in running on its batteries is nearly the equivalent of a coal-burning vehicle. The trade-off is one that even plug-in backers acknowledge. It could undercut the appeal of vehicles that appear capable of using no gasoline in town and hitting 50 to 100 mpg overall fuel economy. 
If large numbers of plug-in hybrids were being recharged with power from the least-sophisticated coal plants, "There is a possibility for significant increases of soot and mercury," says a report by environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council. Soot particles can make it hard to breathe, especially for asthmatics. Mercury is toxic. 
"Plug-in hybrids are perhaps not good for all areas," says Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based advocacy group. In "states that are heavily coal, that equation doesn't work out very well for the environment." 
After PHEVs drain their stored energy, they operate like conventional hybrids, triggering their gasoline engines to help drive the wheels and recharge the batteries. Conventionals can't be plugged in; their batteries are recharged only while driving. 
The longer a plug-in is designed to operate on just the batteries, the less gasoline it uses, but the more electricity it needs to recharge the larger batteries. 
Thus, the better the PHEV -- that is, the longer it goes just on its batteries -- the greater the charge required and the more the pollution that might result from an electric utility's power generation. 
Learner calls PHEVs "really important emerging technology -- where the cleaner technologies are used to charge them." 
Sulfur dioxide also may be an issue 
A study by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency found plug-ins also could result in more sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. SO2 is toxic in large amounts and is a component of corrosive acid rain. 
The Minnesota study found that use of PHEVs would lower most emissions compared with other vehicles, but that resulting SO2 emissions would be more than double those from gasoline vehicles and about three or four times greater than from driving a regular hybrid. Exactly how much depends on how far the PHEV can run on battery power alone. 
The Minnesota study also found that PHEVs would emit more carbon dioxide (CO2) than driving a conventional hybrid. CO2 is a greenhouse gas thought to contribute to global warming. 
The Minnesota numbers are striking because they predict the big jump in SO2 even if 40% of the state's electricity were generated by wind power, not coal or other polluting fuels. About 4% of the state's electricity now is from wind, according to state officials. 
The state's PHEV study concludes: "Alternative vehicles offer benefits, but no single technology currently stands out as a clear choice." 
The NRDC calculus shows that a plug-in charged from a power plant burning the dirtiest type of coal still has an overall pollution level less than a conventional gasoline car. But it would produce 11% more greenhouse gas emissions than a regular, non-plug-in hybrid, according to Luke Tonachel, vehicles analyst at the NRDC and co-author of the group's report on plug-ins. The report was produced jointly with the non-profit Electric Power Research Institute. 
He says, however, that charging a plug-in with electricity from renewable resources -- wind or water, for instance -- cuts overall greenhouse gas emissions to as low as a conventional gasoline car getting 74 mpg. No current gasoline car does that. 
The NRDC and Minnesota studies were published last year but have yet to trigger alarms. PHEVs still are experimental; their possible threat is distant. 
"It seems a little premature to think of it being a problem -- but there are a lot of issues we should have been thinking of sooner," says Charles Griffith, auto project director at the Ecology Center, an environmental non-profit based in Michigan. He cites as an example debate over use of land to grow crops for ethanol fuel vs. for food. 
Even so, Griffith says, "The scenario where there are so many plug-in hybrids plugged into the (electric power) grid that you'll see a change in air quality just doesn't sound true to me." 
Plug-ins may be on streets soon 
Automakers say PHEVs could be on the streets in significant numbers within five years. Prototypes being tested by car companies suggest they should be able to go up to 40 miles on battery power, which could enable them to deliver average mileage in the neighborhood of 100 mpg in general driving. 
The first plug-in vehicle in production, however, is likely to be General Motors' Chevrolet Volt, which is not a hybrid. Due in 2010 or 2011,Volt runs entirely on battery power. Like PHEVs, its battery pack can be recharged by plugging into a normal outlet, using electricity from a utility generating plant. A small gasoline engine recharges Volt's batteries when an outlet isn't handy, but unlike in a hybrid, that engine never directly powers the car. GM could sell 60,000 or more a year, forecasts consultant J.D. Power and Associates, if the price is $30,000 or less. 
GM said at the Detroit auto show in January that it also will produce a plug-in hybrid version of its Saturn Vue SUV near the same time Volt is to launch. 
Toyota Motor and Ford Motor each showed a prototype plug-in hybrid at auto shows this year and will test the designs. "It will come," says Toyota's Jaycie Chitwood, senior planner at the automaker's advanced technologies unit in the USA. "It's more a question of 'when' than 'if.'" 
Ford's Greg Frenette, chief engineer of zero-emission vehicles, says it should take no more than five years to decide if plug-ins can be made reliable and inexpensive enough. 
The U.S. Energy Department is backing PHEVs. 
In January it offered $30 million for projects to "deliver up to 40 miles of electric range without recharging" and to make plug-ins "cost-competitive by 2014 and ready for commercialization by 2016." 
"We look at plug-in hybrids as the next generation of hybrids. They run cleaner, they save oil and they can save consumers money at the pump," NRDC's Tonachel says. But, he says, "Until our oldest power plants are replaced or upgraded, there could be increases in local particulate matter and ozone." 
Three plug-ins coming soon 
Chevy Volt: Concept car at the Detroit auto show in 2007 may be the first plug-in to go into production, in 2010 or 2011. 
Toyota Prius PHEV: The plug-in hybrid will go about 7 miles on battery power alone before switching to gas-electric hybrid mode. 
Ford Escape: The hybrid plug-in can get over 100 mpg. Ford says that careful drivers could stay on battery power for 30 miles.

Study debunks 'global cooling' concern of '70s

Abstract 
Skeptics have argued that climate change is cyclical, not fueled by the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas. 

Full Text 
The supposed "global cooling" consensus among scientists in the 1970s -- frequently offered by global-warming skeptics as proof that climatologists can't make up their minds ­
- is a myth, according to a survey of the scientific literature of the era. 
The '70s was an unusually cold decade. Newsweek, Time, The New York Times and National Geographic published articles at the time speculating on the causes of the unusual cold and about the possibility of a new ice age. But Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center surveyed dozens of peer-reviewed scientific articles from 1965 to 1979 and found that only seven supported global 
cooling, while 44 predicted warming. Peterson says 20 others were neutral in their assessments of climate trends. 
The study reports, "There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age. 
"A review of the literature suggests that, to the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking about the most important forces shaping Earth's climate 

on human time scales." 
Peterson was also a contributor to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 report. 
Scientific reports in the past decade, most notably the U.N. panel's Nobel Prize-winning efforts, have warned that human activities are warming the planet by increasing the 

release of heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases into the atmosphere. 

Skeptics have argued that climate change is cyclical, not fueled by the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas. Peterson notes in the study that concerns over the frigid 1970s subsequently became representative of scientific division over global warming. That was an unusually cold decade, especially the later years, across the Northern Hemisphere. In the USA, the winters of 1977-79 were three of the 11 coldest since the 
recording of temperatures began in the 1890s, according to climate center data. The winter of 1978-79 remains the coldest on record in the USA. 
Some have doubts about the new survey. "The paper does not place the late '70s in its climatic context," says Pat Michaels, a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. "The temperature records we had at the time showed a very sharp cooling from the mid-'40s to the mid-'70s," Michaels says. "And scientists attempted to explain that as a 
consequence of the pollution that was preventing solar radiation from reaching the surface. 
"At the time, scientists thought the cooling effect of pollution was greater than the warming effect of carbon dioxide," Michaels adds. "They were attempting to explain the dramatic cooling of the '70s." But Robert Henson, a writer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and author of The Rough Guide to Climate Change, says: "This is an important part of science 
history, and Peterson and his co-authors have done a great job of excavating it. 
"People have long claimed that scientists in the 1970s were convinced a new ice age was imminent. But in fact, many researchers at the time were already more concerned about the long-term risks of global warming." Along with Peterson, the study was also authored written by William Connolly of the British Antarctic Survey and John Fleck of The Albuquerque Journal. The research will be 
published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE Average temperatures in the coldest U.S. winters since 1895, three of which occurred in the 1970s: Degrees Fahrenheit 1978-79 27.28 1935-36 28.62

Abstract 
The carbon inhaler's developer, Global Research Technologies, is among hundreds of U.S. companies scouring for ways to reduce the world's greenhouse gas emissions and cash in on federal requirements anticipated by 2010 to combat global warming. Hedge funds and investment banks are starting to trade offsets like stocks and bonds, betting they could soar in value if greenhouse gas caps are imposed. 

Full Text 
The phone-booth-size machine humming away in a Tucson lab may look like a science-fair project on steroids. Its inventors, however, say it's a potent new weapon in the battle against global warming. 
Its task is elegantly direct. The 9-foot-tall device, encased in see-through plastic, scrapes the chief global warming gas -- carbon dioxide -- right out of the atmosphere. As air wafts through, CO{-2} sticks to large chemically coated panels while oxygen and other innocuous gases breeze by. The carbon inhaler's developer, Global Research Technologies, is among hundreds of U.S. companies scouring for ways to reduce the world's greenhouse gas emissions and cash in on federal requirements anticipated by 2010 to combat global warming. 
"It's a gold rush," says Peter Fusaro, head of consulting firm Global Change Associates. 
The CO{-2}-busting industry is exploding as federal legislation to cap the emissions of utilities and other industries grows more likely, offering the prospect of huge profits. Nearly 400 start-ups are operating 600 carbon-mitigation projects in the USA, with the number of companies set to triple the next two years, says consulting firm Point Carbon. 
Their product? Carbon offsets. One carbon offset, or credit, equals a ton of CO{-2} removed from the air. 
Hedge funds and investment banks are starting to trade offsets like stocks and bonds, betting they could soar in value if greenhouse gas caps are imposed. JPMorgan expects to buy and sell hundreds of millions of offsets this year, up from tens of millions last year. 
For several years, entrepreneurs have had modest success selling credits to corporations and consumers who want to be good citizens and offset the carbon that's produced when they drive cars or use electricity. 
Many are deploying tried-and-true techniques such as burning the noxious emissions of landfills and cow manure and restoring forests. Others are testing grander but more controversial strategies, such as growing carbon-absorbing plankton in the South Pacific. 
The voluntary market for U.S. offsets is still meager, though it more than doubled last year to $150 million to $200 million, says research firm Ecosystem Marketplace. In Europe, which has complied with mandatory carbon limits since 2005 under the Kyoto treaty, the offset market hit $10 billion last year. Sales in the USA, the world's biggest carbon emitter, could be as high as $175 billion by 2020 if a federal cap is approved, says research firm New Carbon Finance. 
Such legislation has grown all but inevitable. Although President Bush opposes carbon caps, Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republican front-runner John McCain all favor curbs. Many analysts expect a law to be passed by 2010 and caps to start as early as 2012. 
Under a bill that cleared a Senate committee in December, global-warming discharges by major polluting U.S. industries would be cut 71% by 2050. A cap and trade system would be created to spur progress. Utilities, oil companies and manufacturers that exceed their emissions caps would buy allowances -- which don't yet exist -- from others in those industries that fall under their limits. Unlike an offset, which is a ton of carbon extracted from the air, an allowance lets a company emit a ton of CO{-2}. 
The number of allowances would fall over the years, driving up prices, as the government lowers maximum emissions. 
Costs come down on consumers 
The two carbon currencies -- allowances and offsets -- will likely merge. The leading proposal in Congress would let companies offset up to 30% of their emissions by buying carbon credits. In other words, instead of cutting its own pollution or purchasing allowances, a utility could buy offsets that fund carbon reduction elsewhere in the USA. That would be a boon for offset suppliers, which could sell credits at much higher volumes and prices than they do now. 
Today, offsets cost $3 to $8, Evolution Markets says, but they're expected to track the prices of allowances as those enter the market. Allowances are expected to cost at least $25 by 2020 and $60 by 2040. 
Those costs largely would be passed on to consumers. Electric rates in some areas could rise up to 45%, and gasoline prices could go up 25 cents a gallon by 2020 under some forecasts. 
If allowance prices get high enough, it will become economical for emitters to make permanent fixes, such as adding pollution-cutting equipment to a carbon-belching coal plant. 
Yet some frown on offsets. David Doniger, a policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, fears excessive use of offsets early in a cap-and-trade program could encourage polluters to put off investments to slash their emissions. 
Offset suppliers face other uncertainties that could torpedo their plans. It's unclear what types of projects would qualify for offsets and whether credits that predate a new law would be eligible. Officials also would examine whether a project would have gone ahead even without offsets, likely disqualifying it for credits. 
Despite the hazy outlook, emitters are starting to buy offsets in the hope they'll be able to use them to meet federal mandates. In the largest such deal, American Electric Power, the nation's biggest coal-fired power generator and greenhouse gas emitter, agreed last year to purchase 4.6 million carbon offsets from Environmental Credit from 2010 to 2017. 
Environmental Credit will generate the offsets by burning the methane produced by the manure of 400,000 cows at 200 farms. Although burning methane produces CO{-2}, methane is 21 times more harmful to the atmosphere. Livestock manure accounts for 6.6% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. 
By purchasing the offsets in future years, when carbon caps are likely to be in place, AEP thinks the Environmental Protection Agency will be more likely to approve them. And by inking a deal now, the utility seeks to lock in lower prices. 
"We're firmly of the mind there will be some kind of global-warming program in the not-too-distant future," says AEP Chief Executive Michael Morris. "To that end, we're trying to build a bank of credit." 
Morris would not say what AEP will pay for the offsets. But Environmental Credit executive Derek Six says it's more than today's $5 price of an agricultural offset but less than the roughly $20 tab projected in the next decade under a federal program. Environmental Credit is spending $25 million to buy equipment for the AEP project and will share offset revenue with farmers. 
Lofty environmental goals 
Others are eyeing bigger carbon bounties. Blue Source plans to capture the carbon dioxide spewed by a Kansas fertilizer plant and sell it to petroleum fields to boost oil output. It's spending about $70 million on equipment to corral the carbon as well as on pipelines to send the gas about 100 miles to the oil fields. Blue Source already has five similar setups in the USA. 
It will snare about 650,000 tons of carbon a year from the Kansas plant, the equivalent of removing 113,000 cars from the road. At today's offset prices, Blue Source will recover its investment in about five years. But projected prices in the next decade under a federal cap would halve the payback period, says CEO Bill Townsend. More than half of the offsets Blue Source sells go for a premium because they're for post-2010 projects that emitters hope will meet federal caps, up from 10% six months ago, he says. 
"It wasn't a bad business before, but it's not the business (a federal cap) will bring us," Townsend says. 
Some start-ups are grounding their businesses in Mother Earth. Equator Environmental plans to restore forests, at a cost of about $1,000 an acre. Deforestation accounts for about 20% of the world's global warming gases. 
With an acre of trees swallowing just 2 to 8 tons of CO{-2} each year and offset prices under $10, the business is barely profitable until a cap brings higher prices, says CEO Jeff Bortniker. Meantime, Equator plans to harvest trees for extra revenue, planting new ones to keep the forest population in balance. 
Still others are tinkering with technologies they say could offer breakthroughs under a federal system that pays top dollar for carbon reductions. The carbon-absorbing machine being tested in Tucson was funded by Gary Comer, the founder of Lands' End who was moved to combat climate change in 2001, when he was able to sail the Arctic Ocean without the aid of an icebreaker. Comer died in 2006. 
If deployed in large numbers, the carbon-filtering machines could slash new emissions and vacuum decades-old gases out of the air, says Allen Wright, president of Global Research Technologies. 
Wright envisions machines the size of 40-foot-long shipping containers that could be trucked to vast isolated stretches where carbon would be buried when technology to do so is available. 
With each device able to remove a ton of carbon a day, about 30 million units could scoop up 10 billion tons a year, or about a third of the world's emissions, he says. Costs to capture carbon initially would be about $250 a ton, far more than the projected $100 per ton price of U.S. allowances in 2050. But Columbia University geophysicist Klaus Lackner, who teamed with Wright to invent the machine, says mass production could drive prices to $30 a ton. 
There are skeptics. Electrodialysis, which separates the carbon from the panels, uses so much electricity that it produces nearly as much carbon as it removes. Capturing and storing CO{-2} from the biggest single source -- coal plants -- as researchers are working to do, would be far more efficient, says Gary Rochelle, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas. "These kinds of projects are a terrible distraction," he says. 
Lackner says the CO{-2} separation instead could be driven by an electricity-free thermal process. 
Another carbon-buster with big ideas is turning toward the open seas. Climos wants to dump up to 1,000 tons of pulverized iron over a patch of ocean as large as 15,000 square miles in a bid to germinate plankton. Iron ore has been shown to promote the growth of the microscopic ocean algae, which inhale as much CO{-2} in six months as a forest consumes in decades. 
Yet critics, such as Rutgers University biophysics professor Paul Falkowski, say the plankton also releases some carbon as it decomposes before it sinks to the ocean bed. As it decays, it produces nitrous oxide, which is far more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon, Falkowski says. 
Climos CEO Dan Whaley, co-founder of travel site GetThere.com, agrees such risks must be studied but says early research suggests the carbon absorbed exceeds toxic emissions enough to make the project viable. If such seedings are repeated annually for 25 years, they could suck in 1 billion tons of CO{-2}, he says. 
With each seeding costing several million dollars, Whaley says a large-scale program would be feasible only under government regimes in the USA or Europe that provide for high offset prices. Yet neither the European system nor proposals in Congress permit ocean-based offset projects. Whaley believes such constraints could be lifted after demonstration projects prove the technology. 
"If it works, then it's a large solution," Whaley says. "We need all the horsepower we can get because the problem is way bigger than we imagined."

Clearing a financial path to cleaner air Carbon offsets today are largely bought by utilities and corporations such as PepsiCo that want to offset the carbon dioxide they produce from trucks and cars or generating electricity. If the federal government caps carbon emissions, certain industries would have to buy carbon allowances and offsets to continue to pollute, which would give them an incentive to cut emissions. Examples of how offsets and allowances work: 
Offsets 
Each offset is a ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere or prevented from entering the atmosphere. 
Allowances 
An allowance is a right to emit a ton of carbon dioxide. Carbon allowances don't exist now.

Abstract 
Together, they'd almost double the amount of solar energy produced nationwide, power 1 million Southern California homes and cleanly generate nearly as much electricity as two smog-producing coal plants. States and nations want renewable sources of energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to pollute less.

ALBUQUERQUE -- When the sun breaks through the clouds here, solar dish No. 0 springs to action. 
Like a giant sunflower, the mirrored face of the 40-foot dish will follow the sun continuously from east to west throughout the day, generating electricity for 10 to 15 homes. 
The dish is a prototype for 70,000 that a small Phoenix company hopes to plant on two 7,000-acre solar farms in the California desert over the next seven years. 
If fully built out, the two solar plants will be two of the biggest in the world. Together, they'd almost double the amount of solar energy produced nationwide, power 1 million 

Southern California homes and cleanly generate nearly as much electricity as two smog-producing coal plants. 

"This is something that hasn't been done before," says Bruce Osborn, CEO of Stirling Energy Systems, the company doing the project. "We're not aware of any showstoppers. ... 
No fatal flaws." 
A 30-employee company that has sometimes struggled to make payroll, Stirling's success or failure will have global implications. States and nations want renewable sources of 

energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to pollute less. Solar, the most expensive renewable energy, accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation. 

But given high oil prices and increased concerns over global warming, anything solar is hot. Stirling's project also aims to commercialize a decades-old technology that is the 
most efficient at converting sun power to electricity but which has struggled with costs and reliability. 
"They clearly have the technology. It's a matter of whether they can get the cost out," says Michael Niggli, chief operating officer of San Diego Gas & Electric, one of the 

customers Stirling hopes to supply. 
Stirling's plans are ambitious. Skeptics, which include a co-founder who left in 2000, say the technology may be too costly to produce power at competitive rates. 
Stirling's plans call for construction to begin in 2009 for two $1 billion farms on federal land in California's Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles and in the Imperial Valley east 

of San Diego. State and federal regulators still have to approve the plans. 
In 2005, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, two of California's biggest utilities, signed contracts enabling them to buy all of Stirling's solar power for 20 

years. The utilities have pledged to buy 800 megawatts annually with the possible addition of 950 more. Contract prices weren't disclosed, but Stirling officials have said they'd compete with what utilities pay for peak power. That's more than coal, which supplies half the USA's electricity, but less than most solar prices. Stirling's technology is a type of solar thermal power, which uses mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat to drive a generator to produce power. The type of solar most people 
know is photovoltaic, in which rooftop panels use semiconductor materials that convert sunlight into electricity. 
Solar thermal is well-suited to large-scale production on desert farms where the sun shines almost every day. Consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates says it's 

likely to be the next high-growth renewable power in the USA. Nearly 5,000 megawatts may go online by 2020, Cambridge says, more than 10 times the amount produced 
today. 
The most prevalent solar thermal technology is a "trough" system, in which hundreds of mirrored sun catchers feed one or a few engines. 
Stirling Energy Systems' technology is different in that each mirrored dish is accompanied by its own engine. The Stirling engine was named after the Rev. Robert Stirling, a 

Scottish clergyman, who patented it in 1816 while seeking an alternative to steam engines with explosive boilers. 
Technology dates to 1980s 
Stirling Energy's dish system was initially developed by McDonnell Douglas in the mid-1980s before being sold to Southern California Edison. Edison sold the technology to 

Stirling Energy Systems, which was founded in 1996 to buy it, for less than $300,000, says Stirling co-founder David Slawson, 60. 
The owner of a massage-therapy college in Oregon, Slawson says he was attracted to the cause of clean energy after waking up one morning, throwing open his window and 
coughing on fumes. Another Stirling co-founder was Harry Braun, author of The Phoenix Project: Shifting from Oil to Hydrogen, a book advocating that the USA shift away from 
fossil fuels. 

Slawson, a political science major with no engineering background, spent much time recruiting investors. Sometimes, he says, cash was so tight he felt like "a robin needing to feed chicks" on paydays. 
In 2003, Stirling attracted its biggest investor, Robert Nissenbaum, an organic foods pioneer and founding partner of Imagine Foods. "When I got involved, the company had a long way to go," says Nissenbaum, Stirling vice chairman, noting that lack of funds had delayed engineering progress. "Since then, we've slowly but surely gotten all the wheels in motion," he says. "We're cautiously optimistic." Stirling's chairman is Robert Clark, a former president of AT&T. 
Osborn, 52, first worked on Stirling solar dish and engine technology as a 22-year-old engineer at Ford. He joined Stirling Energy Systems in 1999 but left in 2002. Market prospects for solar were dim then, he says, and the company wasn't raising enough funds to move forward. He returned in 2004, took the reins from Slawson the next year and watched interest in solar rise. 
Osborn won't reveal much about Stirling's finances except to say that it's raised "tens of millions" over the years and that 2007 was its best fundraising year. He says the company has been "quietly perfecting" its technology with government engineers at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, where dish No.0 and five others have been running for two years. 
Sandia and SES engineers have improved the dishes' design, squeezing out 40% of the steel and making them stronger. They've learned optimal spacing to minimize land use but maximize sun collection. The mirrors have survived lightning strikes and bullets. 
Osborn agrees cost is Stirling's biggest technical challenge. Each hand-built test dish cost $225,000. That needs to drop to less than $50,000, Osborn says. 
As an executive at Western Digital, Osborn oversaw products that went from prototype to high-volume manufacturing in a month. Stirling plans a "conservative" approach to dish construction, he says. It'll build two more at Sandia this year, two more next year, then 40 in the Mojave. Then, he plans to ramp up to 80 a month, then 80 a day. 
Osborn says the modular nature of the system is part of its beauty. Largely built at the factory, each system could be erected in the field by a few workers within hours, he says. Improvements will be put into newer dishes as Stirling learns from older ones. 
"It's not like you build the shuttle, launch it and it works or it doesn't," Osborn says. "Nothing will stop us cold in our tracks." 
Outlook questioned 
Whether Stirling can produce power at profitable rates remains to be seen. Its two utility customers expect their first power in 2010. Braun left Stirling to focus on wind technologies after losing faith that Stirling could compete. "It'll be way too costly," he says, given maintenance costs and the cheaper cost of generating power from wind. 
Barry Butler, a materials science expert who several years ago worked for a Stirling competitor on a similar dish technology, said in written testimony to California energy regulators last year that technology like Stirling's, while promising, wouldn't likely be ready for mass rollout until 2020. He says maintenance will drive up Stirling's costs while rival solar technologies get better and cheaper. 
Getting all of Stirling's power to consumers may also be difficult. For Stirling to get the 900 megawatts to San Diego Gas & Electric, the utility needs a new 150-mile transmission line. Like most power lines, it'll likely prove controversial. Southern California Edison needs to upgrade lines to add Stirling's power and what will be produced from new wind farms. 
The utilities have agreed to pay Stirling so much, leaving it to Stirling to produce at a profit. Still, they benefit if Stirling succeeds. California requires retail sellers of electricity to secure 20% of their energy in 2010 from renewable sources to avoid possible penalties. The utilities also need power most on hot, sunny afternoons when Stirling's dishes will be at their peak. 
"The sun is the 'great untapped resource,' says Southern California Edison's Stuart Hemphill, director of renewable and alternative power. 
Osborn's heard the naysayers for years. He disputes Butler and Braun, noting that the company has made "substantial progress" since Braun left and since Butler worked on the competing system in 2002. 
Of all the renewables, he says, solar will be the biggest. 
"I guarantee there will be issues and challenges. But that's just part of business," he says. 
At least with solar, "You don't have to worry about the fuel supply. It's free from the sky."

Wind energy is blowing up a storm. 
U.S. wind power grew 45% in 2007, the sharpest rise since the 1980s, as developers responded to a federal tax credit, a growing number of state renewable energy mandates and global warming concerns, the American Wind Energy Association said Thursday. 
The industry installed 5,244 megawatts in 2007, accounting for 30% of all new electricity-generating capacity, the AWEA says. That's more than double the largest amount ever added and enough to power 1.5 million homes, says AWEA Executive Director Randall Swisher. U.S. wind power had been annually growing an average 30% the previous five years, he says. 
"I think it signifies that wind will be an increasingly significant contributor to our electricity supply system," Swisher says, predicting that wind could provide 20% of U.S. power by 2020. 
Wind now generates more than 1% of U.S. electricity, the AWEA says. That far surpasses other renewable energies -- such as solar and biomass -- except for large hydroelectric projects. The USA has been the world leader in wind energy growth the past three years, though the nation still trails Germany in total wind power. 
Texas, by far, added the most wind capacity, at 1,618 megawatts, followed by Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Minnesota, the AWEA says. 
The main reason for the robust growth is a federal tax credit of 2 cents per kilowatt hour of energy produced, says analyst Stow Walker of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The tax credit lowers a developer's costs to about 7 cents per kilowatt hour, placing wind costs on par with coal-fired plants. 
Congress approved the tax credit in the 2005 energy bill, and it expires at the end of 2008. The three-year window has given turbine manufacturers confidence in a sustained market for their products, Swisher says. 
By contrast, previous tax credits for wind power expired after a year, creating a boom-and-bust cycle from 1999 to 2004. Although a proposal to further extend the tax credit was ultimately left out of the energy bill that Congress passed last month, Walker predicts lawmakers will extend the credit before it expires. "Congress doesn't want a lack of confidence in the industry just as it's getting so big," he says. 
Another factor pushing wind development is that 29 states now require utilities to include a percentage of renewable energy in the mix of power they generate and buy. A growing number of states also are adopting plans to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that cause global warming. 
Although wind power should continue to increase sharply in coming years, growth could be somewhat constrained in the near term. Manufacturers are sold out for this year as torrid worldwide wind power growth has created a wind turbine shortage, Swisher and Walker say. The crunch, though, will likely be short-lived: Developers opened or announced at least 14 new turbine plants in the USA last year. 
Also, with wind farms often located in rural reaches of states such as Texas and Iowa, wind developers increasingly face a lack of transmission lines to transport the electricity to population centers, Walker says.

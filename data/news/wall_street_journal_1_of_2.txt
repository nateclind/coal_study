WASHINGTON -- When President Barack Obama lays out plans to tackle climate change in a speech Tuesday, including the first effort to curb greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants, he will unleash a yearslong battle that has little assurance of being resolved during his time in office. 
The president has called climate change a "legacy issue," and his speech may head off a backlash from environmentalists should his administration approve the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. But the address is unlikely to blunt criticism of Mr. Obama's approach from the left or the right. 
He is set to propose a host of measures to help lower emissions of gases that climate scientists say contribute to climate change. These include ways to boost energy efficiency, promote cleaner energy and rein in emissions from existing power plants, according to people briefed on the speech. 
In a video released by the White House over the weekend, Mr. Obama said he would give his vision for a "national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare our country for the impacts of climate change and lead global efforts to fight it." 
Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, "It is important for the president to act because the Congress is still denying the science and is not about to pass any legislation." 
Industry has warned that tough guidelines could lead to the retirement of a large number of coal-fired power plants, which could raise questions about electricity reliability. Many utility executives also say that new rules, by knocking relatively cheap coal off the grid, will lead to higher electricity prices that will disproportionately affect lower-income families. 
Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, said the electric-power industry "has long understood the importance of addressing climate change," and has been working for years to clean up the industry. Of the prospective new rules, he said his trade group will be "considering whether they mesh well with this ongoing transition, contain achievable compliance limits and deadlines, and minimize costs to customers." 
Environmentalists were cheered by the prospect that Mr. Obama will tackle power-plant emissions. Frances Beinecke, the head of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the power sector could cut its emissions by about one-quarter with this approach, meaning the U.S. could cut its total emissions by 10%. 
The Environmental Protection Agency must first complete rules for new power plants, which have been in the works since 2011. In draft form, those rules essentially blocked the construction of new coal-fired plants. Once the draft rules are finished, environmental lawyers say, the EPA would need until at least late 2014 to make final rules for existing plants. 
What's more, the rules would be merely guidelines for states to draw up their own plans for restricting greenhouse gases. Allowing a year for that -- plus more time for the EPA to rewrite state plans if it is dissatisfied with them -- means the process could easily stretch out to the end of Mr. Obama's second term and beyond. 
States that have a rationale to resist new power-plant guidelines could push back against them, said Jeff Holmstead, a former top EPA official under President George W. Bush and now a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani LLP. "EPA's guidelines have no legal effect on any particular plant, and they don't really legally bind the states," Mr. Holmstead said. 
Republicans say any discussion of rules for existing plants is premature because the new standards aren't complete. During confirmation hearings for Gina McCarthy, an EPA official nominated to lead the agency, Sen. David Vitter (R., La.) pressed her on this point, and Ms. McCarthy responded in writing, "EPA is not currently developing any existing source GHG [greenhouse gases] regulations for power plants." 
In light of such comments, Mr. Obama is expected to avoid specifics when discussing his vision for existing power plants, but he is still hoping to assuage environmentalists who fear the president may be planning to approve the Keystone pipeline. 
Tom Steyer, a wealthy investor and a leader of the anti-Keystone movement, said if that is the bargain the president is offering, environmentalists wouldn't accept it. Environmental groups "are getting something that they were always going to get anyway" on power plants, Mr. Steyer said.

Abstract 
Because burning natural gas for power, rather than burning coal, emits fewer greenhouse gases, the growth of natural gas through 2012 took the U.S. partway toward the Obama administration's climate goals. 

Full text 
The Obama administration is set to renew its push to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions, including delayed measures on coal-fired power plants, at a time when price swings have spurred electric utilities to turn back to coal as an energy source. 
On Wednesday, White House energy and climate adviser Heather Zichal said President Barack Obama would soon announce measures to tackle climate change, which she said include a focus "on the power plants piece of the equation." The administration is already months behind schedule in finishing emissions rules, first proposed last year, that would effectively ban new coal-fired plants using current technology. 
In the first quarter of the year, coal use for power generation jumped almost 13% while natural-gas use for power generation fell 8%, according to U.S. government figures. It was a sharp reversal from last year, when a flood of inexpensive natural gas led to the highest-ever use of that fuel for electricity generation while coal-fired electricity fell to its lowest level in a quarter-century. 
In March, natural-gas prices reached $3.95 per million British thermal units, or 78% higher than March 2012, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistics branch of the Department of Energy. Prices continued to creep higher in April, meaning that month's data on electricity generation, to be released Friday, likely will show a continued move toward coal. 
"As natural gas moves up to $3.50 or $3.75, you'll see fuel switching occur," said Nick Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power Co. In the first quarter, AEP saw natural-gas generation fall 30%, while coal-fired electricity generation rose 9%, from a year earlier. 
Because burning natural gas for power, rather than burning coal, emits fewer greenhouse gases, the growth of natural gas through 2012 took the U.S. partway toward the Obama administration's climate goals. Last year, energy-sector greenhouse-gas emissions fell to their lowest levels since the early 1990s, nudged along by administration-led environmental rules. 
Now, the EIA says carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels are expected to jump 2.6% this year, largely because of coal's resurgence, after falling 3.9% last year. That could revive calls for the Obama administration's move to effectively rule out new coal-fired plants using current technology. That plan was proposed last year and originally set to be finished by April. 
"Once you get into the perception that environmental gains are being lost, I do think it's going to have a political impact particularly persuasive to the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency," said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners, an energy consultancy in Washington. 
Ms. Zichal said the White House will announce in a matter of weeks a climate package that will focus on power plants, energy efficiency and renewable energy. She didn't specifically discuss existing power plants, but the EPA also has authority to regulate them. 
In his State of the Union address in February, Mr. Obama signaled his intent to tackle existing plants, saying that if Congress didn't act on climate change, he would direct his cabinet to come up with executive actions he could take. In a speech in Berlin on Wednesday, he reiterated that he sees climate change as "the global threat of our time" and said, "We will do more." 
"Nobody expected that cheap gas to last forever, and we didn't expect last year's emissions trends to continue without standards to ensure continued emissions reductions," said Dan Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
Of course, the revival of coal may turn out to be temporary, especially as some older coal-fired plants go offline in coming years, and some executives say they continue to see natural gas as a key fuel of the future. In the first part of this year, Southern Co. as a whole burned slightly more natural gas and used slightly less coal compared with year-earlier levels, according to company filings.

Abstract 
"The logging industry around here was dead a few years ago," said Paul Burby, owner of a firm called Carolina East Forest Products that hired subcontractors to cut the trees after paying a landowner for rights. If Europe's goal is to reduce carbon emissions, "it doesn't make any sense to cut down the trees that are sequestering carbon," said Debbie Hammel, a resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 

Full Text 
WINDSOR, N.C. -- Loggers here are clear-cutting a wetland forest with decades-old trees. 
Behind the move: an environmental push. 
The push isn't in North Carolina but in Europe, where governments are trying to reduce fossil-fuel use and carbon-dioxide emissions. Under pressure, some of the Continent's 

coal-burning power plants are switching to wood. 

But Europe doesn't have enough forests to chop for fuel, and in those it does have, many restrictions apply. So Europe's power plants are devouring wood from the U.S., where forests are bigger and restrictions fewer. This dynamic is bringing jobs to some American communities hard hit by mill closures. It is also upsetting conservationists, who say cutting forests for power is hardly an 
environmental plus. 
On a hot Tuesday along North Carolina's Roanoke River, crews were cutting the trees in a swampy 81-acre parcel, including towering tupelos. While many of the trunks went for lumber, the limbs and the smaller trees were loaded on trucks headed to a mill 30 miles away, to be ground up, compressed into pellets and put on ships to Europe. "The logging industry around here was dead a few years ago," said Paul Burby, owner of a firm called Carolina East Forest Products that hired subcontractors to cut the trees 
after paying a landowner for rights. "Now that Europe is using all these pellets, we can barely keep up." 
The logging is perfectly legal in North Carolina and generally so elsewhere in the U.S. South. In much of Europe, it wouldn't be. 
The U.K., for example, requires loggers to get permits for any large-scale tree-cutting. They must leave buffers of standing trees along wetlands, and they generally can't clear­
cut wetlands unless the purpose is to restore habitat that was altered by tree planting, said a spokesman for the U.K. Forestry Commission. 
Italy and Lithuania make some areas off-limits for clear-cutting, meaning cutting all of the trees in an area rather than selectively taking the mature ones. Switzerland and 
Slovenia completely prohibit clear-cutting. It is a common logging practice in the U.S. 

U.S. wood thus allows EU countries to skirt Europe's environmental rules on logging but meet its environmental rules on energy. 
The wood-power industry says its approach is environmentally sound. "We only take the low-value material from the forest," said Nigel Burdett, the environment chief for Drax PLC, a U.K. power company that is converting some coal units at the U.K.'s biggest power plant to wood and setting up pellet mills in the U.S. 
The industry also cites the ability of trees newly planted after cutting to absorb greenhouse gases. "Young trees absorb more carbon than older trees," said John Keppler, chief executive of the U.S.'s biggest wood-pellet exporter, Enviva LP, at a London conference on "biomass" power in April. "What's the best way to get more carbon absorbed? Cut it down. Replant." 
Environmental groups dispute that logic. They say all the carbon that mature trees have been "sequestering" is instantly released when they are burned, far more rapidly than saplings can absorb it. 
If Europe's goal is to reduce carbon emissions, "it doesn't make any sense to cut down the trees that are sequestering carbon," said Debbie Hammel, a resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
The European Union's environment agency said it is trying to assess the consequences of creating a U.S. pellet boom. "The European Commission is currently analyzing the environmental risks" of large-scale biomass production, said a spokeswoman for the office of the energy commissioner at the Commission, which is the EU's executive body. 
The Commission, she said by email, is trying to determine "whether such risks can be effectively managed through existing forest/environmental policies." 
The push began in 2007, when the Commission set a goal, by 2020, of reducing Europe's greenhouse-gas emissions to 20% below their 1990 level. It also set a goal of moving Europe to 20% renewable energy by 2020. 
Solar and wind couldn't meet the latter goal, policy makers recognized. They said wood qualified as a renewable energy source as long as it came from forests that would grow back. Emissions from burning wood contain less of certain chemicals, such as sulfur, than coal smoke. 
European countries devised a system of awarding credits to companies that generate electricity from renewable sources. They then can sell their credits to electricity suppliers. 
Drax has long burned coal in a plant rising from pastoral Yorkshire fields. This has become an increasingly unattractive practice, for a variety of reasons that include a carbon tax floor the U.K. made effective this year. Drax has set out to convert half its coal units to wood. 
The plant has converted one of its six units so far, and last year it sold about $90 million of renewable-energy credits to other companies, a spokeswoman said. After it fully converts two more units, Drax expects to burn about seven million tons of wood annually and collect about $600 million a year from renewable-energy credits. 
On a recent day, workers were finishing two giant concrete domes to store pellets, which arrive from ports on Drax's own rail line. "The vast majority" come from the U.S., Drax said. 
Reasons for favoring the U.S., besides its ample forests close to ports, include political pressure in Europe against buying in countries where there would be a risk of getting illegally harvested tropical hardwoods. 
Europe's nine largest wood-burning utilities consumed 6.7 million tons of wood pellets in 2012, according to Argus Media, which tracks the industry. Argus expects European pellet consumption to nearly double by 2020, with much of the new demand met from the U.S. American mills exported 1.9 million tons of pellets last year, up nearly fourfold in three years, by Argus's figures. 
U.S. exports of coal to Europe have also risen, owing partly to price fluctuations in natural gas. Energy analysts call the trend temporary since some coal plants are set to close in coming years. 
The pellet economy appears to be developing faster than rules to guide it. 
Principles the EU has told member countries to follow say wood for energy can't come from forests that aren't reforested after cutting. Also, trees from sensitive areas like wetlands, old-growth forests or areas of wide biodiversity aren't supposed to be burned for power. Doing so would violate sustainability criteria the European Commission has outlined, said the spokeswoman for the commission's office of the energy commissioner. 
Those criteria were set for biofuels such as alcohol distilled from wood. The EU has told member countries to use the same guidelines in forming their policies on wood as fuel, though this currently isn't binding on them. The EU is currently studying wood-specific rules. Individual countries will be responsible for interpreting and enforcing them, said people involved in the policy process. 
In the U.K., it still isn't clear exactly what restrictions there ultimately will be on wood from wetlands trees, said the U.K. Department of Conservation and Climate Change. The U.K.'s draft rules indicate it might be permissible to use some such wood if it were determined that logging it didn't permanently change a wetland's ecosystem, a spokeswoman said. European authorities can't mandate what forests in other countries are harvested, only tell European companies what kind of wood fuel will qualify for renewable credits. 
With the rules so unsettled, ensuring the forestry is sustainable has been left largely to power companies and pellet suppliers. 
Drax said it carefully monitors its supply chain. "We are not taking old-growth forest," said the company's Mr. Burdett. Drax said it requires pellet suppliers to exclude wood from areas that would be permanently deforested or have their ecosystems destroyed. 
Many of the pellet-making plants springing up in the U.S. -- which include plants planned by Drax and other European power companies -- are near pine plantations established long ago partly to serve the now-slumping wood-pulp market. 
Enviva charted a different course. The company, backed by New York private-equity firm Riverstone Holdings, put some of its pellet plants near natural hardwood forests that had established loggers and access to ports, but depressed tree-cutting activity because of pulp-mill closures. Enviva, a supplier to Drax, recently opened one of its largest plants so far in Northhampton County, N.C., in the coastal hardwood belt. 
Mr. Burby, the logger who bought rights to cut trees along the Roanoke River near Windsor, said that in the past, he would "shovel-log" the swamps -- clear-cut them with bulldozer-like vehicles riding on makeshift roads made of trees. He sold the large trunks to lumber mills and smaller stuff to pulp mills. 
In 2009, a paper-company pulp mill he sold to closed. His business fell off steeply, partly because "you couldn't get rid of the hardwood pulpwood." Landowners didn't want big mounds of limbs piling up, and without a market for the pulpwood, it was hard to make a profit. 
Now, Enviva's pellet mill in Ahoskie, N.C., has created a new market for pulp-grade wood. Standing on a section of higher ground near the Roanoke, Mr. Burby said the pellet mill made it possible for him to keep his crew working there, cutting the pine, oak, beech and sycamore in the drier sections and the tupelo gum and cypress hardwoods that grow tall in the flooded areas. 
"With Enviva opening up, you can justify shovel-logging again," Mr. Burby said. 
The North Carolina Forest Service allows logging in wetlands as long as it complies with state laws prohibiting destruction of waterways, said a spokesman, Brian Haines. Among voluntary "best management" practices, the agency urges loggers in its published guidelines to "minimize activity on saturated soils and near waterbodies." In wet areas, the state recommends building roads out of trees as Mr. Burby did, to help keep heavy machines from damaging the wetland. 
Enviva said it requires timber suppliers to follow state-recommended best-management practices and sometimes audits logging operations. Customers sometimes inspect Enviva's operations, its spokeswoman said, so it has an incentive to be careful where its wood comes from. 
Still, wood from forests with trees more than 100 years old, including some from wetlands, does wind up in pellet plants, according to loggers. In recent months, foresters have clear-cut portions of two such Roanoke River areas and delivered some of the wood to Enviva's mill in Ahoskie, the loggers said. 
Logger George Henerson said that earlier this year, he sold Enviva several hundred tons of hardwood that his crew clear-cut from a swamp that hadn't been logged for about 100 years. 
"Enviva, now they need wood bad enough that they're paying for some swamp logging," said Mr. Henerson. 
Academics who study wetland forests say some of those along the Roanoke are sensitive environments that it may not be possible to clear-cut sustainably. William Conner, a forestry professor at Clemson University, said recent research shows that wetland trees in the Roanoke area regrow slowly after clear-cutting and without the same species mix. 
Stanley Riggs, a geologist at East Carolina University, said that besides the animal and plant habitat that mature wetland forests provide, they help prevent flooding. He said clear-cutting them is "destroying a whole ecosystem." A North Carolina group called the Dogwood Alliance, along with the Natural Resources Defense Council, is launching a campaign against pellet mills. 
Enviva's spokeswoman said the swamps along the Roanoke were logged sustainably, because the loggers took measures to prevent damaging the ground, such as keeping their bulldozers on a temporary road, and the landowners will let the trees naturally regrow.

Abstract 
[...]any legislative steps to restrain carbon emissions are unlikely to get through Congress, and an effort by Mr. Obama's Environmental Protection Agency to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions from new coal-fired power plants has run into legal issues. 

Full Text 
The daily average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a benchmark U.S. monitoring site has reached 400 parts per million for the first time, U.S. government scientists said Friday. 
The site at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, has been monitoring carbon dioxide since 1958 and recorded the milestone on Thursday, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carbon dioxide is the most significant of the greenhouse gases that many scientists have said are contributing to global warming. 
The U.S. agency said the average concentration of carbon dioxide before the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century was about 280 parts per million, and the figure has steadily risen in recent decades. 
"The evidence is conclusive that the strong growth of global CO2 emissions from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving the acceleration," said NOAA scientist Pieter Tans in a news release. 
In his second inaugural address, President Barack Obama said, "We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations." However, any legislative steps to restrain carbon emissions are unlikely to get through Congress, and an effort by Mr. Obama's Environmental Protection Agency to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions from new coal-fired power plants has run into legal issues. 
Republican lawmakers warn that any steps by Washington to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could harm the economic recovery. "It is difficult to understand the everyday cost of these regulations and the climate agenda until you have to pay electric bills, purchase groceries, put gas in your car," said Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.) in January.

Abstract 
Late last year, the EU said its emissions have fallen 17.5% since 1990 and were "on track" to meet its 20% reduction target under the Kyoto agreement by 2020. Since 1990, 
U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions are up 8%. 

Full Text 
U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically in recent years, in large part because the country is making more electricity with natural gas instead of coal. 
Energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is widely believed to contribute to global warming, have fallen 12% between 2005 and 2012 and are at their lowest level since 1994, according to a recent estimate by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department. 
While other factors, including a sluggish U.S. economy and increasing energy efficiency, have contributed to the decline in carbon emissions from factories, automobiles and power plants, many experts believe the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation has been the biggest factor. Carbon-dioxide emissions account for nearly 84% of greenhouse-gas emissions, while methane -- the main ingredient in natural gas -- makes up 8.8%, according to a recent Environmental Protection Agency report. 
Natural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when used to make electricity, though the calculation fails to take into account the release of methane from natural-gas wells and pipelines, which also contributes to climate change. 
Few people predicted this drop in carbon emissions. "Everybody just figured that emissions were just going to continue to increase rapidly," says Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, an energy and climate think tank based in Oakland, Calif. "Nobody was expecting the worst recession since the Great Depression, but also no one was really expecting this remarkable shift from coal to gas either." 
Last year, 30% of power in the U.S. came from burning natural gas, up from 19% in 2005, driven by drilling technologies that have unlocked large and inexpensive new supplies of the fuel. 
The U.S. trend hasn't led to a global decline in carbon emissions, which increased 15% from 2005 through 2011, according to federal statistics. An International Energy Agency report this week concluded that China's rising reliance on coal to fuel economic growth jeopardizes progress toward what the IEA calls "a low-carbon future." But the U.S., which has decreased its carbon-dioxide output tonnage more than any other nation, demonstrates that market forces can have an impact on greenhouse gases even as politicians continue to disagree over what, if any, federal regulations are needed to force industries to reduce their emissions. 
White House spokesman Clark Stevens said important progress had been made reducing emissions and the federal government was committed to implementing standards that "help ensure that we remain on a path to reduce these emissions." 
U.S. carbon-dioxide output rose steadily in the 1990s and 2000s, peaking in 2007. In 2008, the economy weakened and power generation from natural gas and renewables began to increase, a combination that led to a sharp reduction in emissions. The Energy Department, which had been expecting increasing emissions, began lowering its forecasts in 2009. It now says carbon-dioxide emissions will begin rising year-on-year in 2015 but won't return to 2005 levels through 2040. 
These rapid U.S. declines may be short-lived, as natural-gas prices rise and utilities increase coal consumption. "Our coal-fired generation has certainly picked up" in recent months, says Nick Akins, chief executive of Ohio-based American Electric Power Co. Natural-gas prices have risen for eight straight weeks, recently closing at $4.40 per million British thermal units, more than twice its price a year ago. 
Mr. Akins also says that stronger economic growth in the U.S. would reverse some of the recent changes. "If the economy were to pick back up considerably before you are able to put new natural-gas capacity in place," he said, "you would expect carbon emissions to increase because coal is going to pick up as well." 
As the U.S. has reduced its coal consumption, it has increased its coal exports to Europe, which rose 23% in 2012 from a year earlier, according to federal statistics. Gerard Mestrallet, chief executive of French power group GDF Suez SA, says that European utilities imported and burned that coal, raising carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants in Europe. He said as-yet unpublished figures for GDF will show an increase in emissions last year. 
European officials have criticized both the U.S. and China at recent United Nations climate summits for a lack of political will to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The European Union instituted regulations requiring its member states to lower emissions. The EU has also reduced its overall greenhouse-gas emissions to meet requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, a U.N. compact adopted in 2005 which the U.S. hasn't signed. Late last year, the EU said its emissions have fallen 17.5% since 1990 and were "on track" to meet its 20% reduction target under the Kyoto agreement by 2020. Since 1990, U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions are up 8%. But since 2005, U.S. emissions have fallen faster than Europe's. 
The rapid decline in U.S. emissions has taken some pressure off the White House after the 2010 failure of a cap-and-trade bill meant to put a price on carbon emissions. Instead, the Obama administration has embraced environmentally responsible production of natural gas as a relatively painless way to meet both energy and environmental goals. 
The decline in U.S. emissions from 2005 to 2012 -- 706 million metric tons of carbon dioxide -- puts the U.S. a long way toward achieving the 17% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from 2005 the Obama administration set as its 2020 goal a few years ago. 
Groups in favor of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to reduce the threat posed by climate change say far deeper reductions than that 17% are needed. "The wildfires, storms and droughts we've seen over the past few years have shown us we need to make even steeper reductions in emissions than were proposed a few years ago," says Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. 
There is considerable worry by many observers of the gas industry that federal figures of overall greenhouse-gas-emissions reductions may be misleading because they fail to account for the impact of natural gas that leaks into the atmosphere from drilling and pipelines. A recent EPA report noted that U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane and other contributors, were 6.9% below 2005 levels, but this data didn't include 2012. 
"The fundamental question is, are we making progress in reducing global warming -- and that is a question of whether or not we are controlling methane leaks," says Mark Brownstein, head of the U.S. Climate and Energy Program at the Environmental Defense Fund, which is leading new studies to determine how much natural gas leaks from wells and pipelines. 
"If you measure the extent of the problem, you can manage the problem," he says. "We just haven't been measuring and therefore we haven't been managing."

LONDON -- The world has made almost no progress over the past 20 years in reducing the carbon content of its energy supplies, despite more than $2 trillion of investment into 

renewable-energy projects such as wind and solar power, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. 
In its third annual report tracking the progress of clean energy, the IEA, which advises rich and industrialized countries on energy policy, paints a bleak picture of global efforts 
to reduce carbon emissions. 

Carbon-dioxide emissions from each unit of energy consumed have fallen by less than 1% since 1990, largely because of coal's dominance as a fuel for electricity generation, 

the IEA said. As energy consumption has grown, this means total global emissions of CO2 rose 44% from 1990 to 2010, it said. 
The IEA estimates that a cut in carbon emissions per unit of energy of more than 60% is needed to prevent global average temperatures rising by more than 3.6 degrees 
Fahrenheit in the long term, and maintaining current levels would yield a temperature rise of 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 

"The drive to clean up the world's energy system has stalled," IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven said. "We need a rapid expansion in low-carbon energy technologies 

if we are to avoid a potentially catastrophic warming of the planet." 
Coal has been preferred in fast-growing Asian economies for decades because it is relatively inexpensive and abundant, the IEA said, and coal-fired generation "has far 
outpaced" the significant increase from non-fossil energy. China and India accounted for 95% of the growth in global coal demand in 2000 to 2011, the IEA said. 

Even in Europe, which has some of the world's most ambitious emissions-reduction targets, coal use is rising, according to the IEA.

Abstract 
[...]a molecule of methane (CH4) released to the atmosphere has a greenhouse effect that is 25 times as large as that of a molecule of CO2 over their respective atmospheric lifetimes. The people who would receive dividend checks because of their status as taxpayers or recipients of Earned Income Tax Credit or Social Security benefits would generally be adults, and not even all adults would be included. 

Full Text 
With all due respect to George P. Shultz and Gary S. Becker, I wish to register strong disagreement with their suggestions in "Why We Support a Revenue-Neutral Carbon Tax" (op-ed, April 8). 
There has never been a revenue-neutral, federally managed tax of any kind, and to suggest that either the Social Security Administration or the IRS would ever stand any chance of providing revenue neutrality on a carbon tax is beyond description. 
To the authors' credit they suggest that it should be a primary goal of any future energy-industry tax strategy to eliminate all subsidies -- for every participant in the energy market. That means the production tax credit for renewable energy needs to go away. 
Enough about carbon taxes. If you have a goal of higher energy prices, put on the tax and you will achieve the desired effect. If you want to punish Americans for being the most creative, constructive energy producers and deliverers on the globe, then pass a carbon tax and become just like our model tax-and-spend state, California. 
Dennis Hedke

I fully agree with the idea that external costs need to be accounted for in establishing a long-term energy policy. However, carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant in the normal sense of the term in that it doesn't harm people or animals and is actually beneficial to plants and trees. The fact that carbon dioxide probably has a long-term deleterious effect on the climate is a different issue that needs to be addressed separately as part of a policy aimed at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Carbon dioxide isn't the only GHG, nor is it the worst. In fact, a molecule of methane (CH4) released to the atmosphere has a greenhouse effect that is 25 times as large as that of a molecule of CO2 over their respective atmospheric lifetimes. 
It is true that gas-fired power plants emit less carbon dioxide than coal-fired plants. However, they still emit large amounts of GHGs, particularly if one also takes into account the methane that is leaked into the atmosphere at the gas well and in its transport. The real long-term solution is more use of nuclear energy. 
Jan B. van Erp 
Hinsdale, Ill. 
As with most economists, I agree with the idea of a carbon tax as the best policy approach to greenhouse problems and wrote several articles some years ago to this effect. The funds should also be separated from general revenues, but I would place a priority on a trust fund for energy research and development. 
Even a small tax would raise big money relative to recent budgets for research. And it would provide stability of funding which has been lacking for 40 years. The best solution to any carbon problem is to find noncarbon energy at lower cost through research. If and as it becomes more obvious that a larger tax is needed to help offset warming, the greater proceeds could be used to help developing nations create low-carbon energy sectors. 
Bruce N. Stram, Ph.D. 
Houston 
It amazes me how two people as incredibly accomplished as George Shultz and Gary Becker can propose what they call a "revenue-neutral" carbon tax. Ignoring their uncertain premise that man has affected the climate and can do something to change it, their proposed tax ignores one of the most basic natural laws. That law is that politicians will always change the original deal. No tax remains small. No tax remains revenue neutral. Politicians can't help themselves and Messrs. Shultz and Becker should know better. 
Alan Kline 
Toledo, Ohio 
The revenue-neutral carbon tax proposed by Messrs. Shultz and Becker is an excellent idea for tackling environmental problems associated with energy. 
Revenue neutrality is also an excellent idea. However, the way the authors propose to distribute the tax money to the public "on the grounds of ease of administration" doesn't 

treat all people equally. The people who would receive dividend checks because of their status as taxpayers or recipients of Earned Income Tax Credit or Social Security benefits would generally be adults, and not even all adults would be included. A proper dividend to the public should be exactly that, a dividend paid to all individuals -- men, women, children -- subject to the jurisdiction of our government. While such a 
universal dividend might require its own administrators, the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend shows that it would be quite feasible. 
Paul deLespinasse 
Corvallis, Ore. 

The authors may believe that carbon (dioxide) is a "major pollutant," but nowhere in their op-ed do we find a hint about the actual environmental benefits attendant upon the imposition of a carbon tax. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimate of the temperature effect of a doubling of carbon-dioxide concentrations by 2100 is three degrees Celsius. U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases are about 18% of global emissions, so that our contribution would be about 0.5 degrees. If we were to cut that in half -- an impossible goal economically -- the reduction in U.S. "pollution" would be 0.2-0.3 degrees, the climate effect of which would be unmeasurable. 
There is nothing "efficient" about a tax that yields no benefit, and were the tax to be imposed by international agreement (a tax cartel), efficiency would be the least likely outcome. Their call for revenue (actually, spending) "neutrality" would not yield greater efficiency because there is no particular reason to believe that carbon emissions are a useful proxy for the benefits of government spending. Messrs. Shultz and Becker have given us an idea truly half-baked, which on the plus side probably reduced their carbon footprint.

Big Issues in Energy (A Special Report) --- Should the Federal Government Regulate Fracking?

Abstract 
A study by Resources for the Future, an independent research organization, showed that state standards for well integrity, wastewater management, disclosure of the content of fracking fluid and other aspects of drilling vary considerably, and some states lag far behind others. The Environmental Protection Agency can regulate air and water pollution from drilling sites, but not the drilling process. 

Full Text 
Fracking supporters say it could set America on the road to energy independence and drastically change our economic prospects while helping address climate change. 
But who should be in charge of regulating fracking? 
Fracking -- short for hydraulic fracturing -- involves injecting fluids into the ground to access hard-to-reach reserves of oil and natural gas, including shale gas, which the U.S. 

has in vast abundance but hasn't been able to reach easily up to now. 

Many advocates argue that the federal government should step in and regulate the practice more forcefully because fracking can have big environmental impacts that can't be 
managed effectively by individual states alone. At scale, these advocates say, those hazards inevitably reach across state lines and become a national problem. 
The result could be widespread bans on the practice of fracking and a premature end to the shale-gas revolution, the advocates say. 
But others say that states are well equipped to regulate fracking. They say that the risks of fracking are overstated, and that the impacts of fracking -- both positive and 

negative -- are mostly local, and different people balance them differently. So regulation should be left to the people who feel the impacts most directly. 
Existing federal authority can handle whatever problems may spill across state lines, they say. 

Yes: A National Issue Can't Be Addressed State by State 
By Jody Freeman 
We need stronger federal regulation of fracking for a simple reason: It affects the entire nation, not just individual states. 
Fracking has the potential to help the U.S. achieve energy independence, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse-gas pollution. 
Yet the cumulative environmental impact of drilling at this scale is great, and it needs to be addressed in a comprehensive way. We won't achieve the full promise of fracking if 

environmental impacts and public reaction cause land to be pulled out of production. 

Fracking produces significant amounts of air pollution and methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It also generates wastewater, often containing toxic chemicals. At scale, fracking 
requires vast amounts of water, which can reduce regional supplies. And industrializing the countryside not only disturbs locals, it can harm habitat and wildlife. 
States aren't fully up to the task of regulating these risks. And the problems inevitably cross state borders, making them a national issue. 
A study by Resources for the Future, an independent research organization, showed that state standards for well integrity, wastewater management, disclosure of the content of 

fracking fluid and other aspects of drilling vary considerably, and some states lag far behind others. The same study reported that state enforcement capacity is generally 

lacking, and even states experienced with oil and gas are struggling to keep up with the pace of drilling. 
Even well-intended states may lack the capacity or political will to enforce adequate protections. And there's always the chance that states may compromise standards to attract 
development and jobs. 

States should have a strong say in the regulatory process. But we must set federal minimum standards to guarantee that no state falls below a reasonable level of care. 
Coal mining offers a good analogy. Despite objections that mining was local and best handled by states, Congress passed a federal law setting minimum performance standards 

while giving the states the lead in implementation and letting them tailor rules to local conditions. Congress said mining was a national priority, so its risks should be addressed 
nationally. 
The same holds for fracking. Performance standards are flexible about how to achieve environmental goals, which is important since the geology of drilling sites varies. 
Comprehensive minimum federal standards would also help to build public trust, which is sorely needed right now. 

The debate on fracking is increasingly polarized. Many jurisdictions have banned it, and more will undoubtedly do so if environmental impacts multiply. The industry is only as good as its worst operators. Support for sensible national standards would signal that the industry wants to address public concerns. 
Critics of federal regulation argue that our current legal framework works fine. But fracking regulation is a patchwork of rules and jurisdictions riddled with gaps and inconsistencies. 
The Interior Department has proposed standards for well integrity and public disclosure on federal lands, but state and private lands, where most fracking occurs, are exempted by Congress. The Environmental Protection Agency can regulate air and water pollution from drilling sites, but not the drilling process. Wastewater from fracked wells, though often dangerous, is excused from federal requirements for handling hazardous waste. In some states, as many as six agencies share authority over drilling. 
This is not a regulatory system anyone should be proud of. 
Critics of federal regulation also say that it will raise costs. On this, they are right. But critics, and especially industry leaders, should take the long view: A small increase in regulatory costs is a smart investment in the social license to operate.

No: States Can Best Balance The Competing Interests 
By David Spence Like all forms of energy production, fracking entails risks. States are better equipped than the federal government to regulate most of those risks. Why? Because both the benefits and the costs of fracking fall mostly on states and local communities. States gain the most from added jobs and tax revenue; they face the 
truck traffic, noise, pollution risks and rapid industrial growth. Consequently, states are in the best position to figure out how best to balance fracking's costs and benefits. It is true that the natural-gas industry risks losing public trust if it doesn't perform to high standards. But turning the regulatory framework over to Washington isn't the answer. In general, the federal government should regulate when the important impacts of the regulated activity cross state lines, when states cannot regulate efficiently or when 
national interests are at stake. None of these justifications apply to fracking. 
Only a few of the risks of shale-gas production -- methane leakage, for example -- extend beyond state lines. And the Environmental Protection Agency is addressing those 
interstate risks already, using its existing regulatory authority. 
As for the argument that states just can't handle the job of regulating, it is true that regulation lagged behind the industry's growth in some states at first. But states are quickly 

adapting. States are strengthening their shale-gas regulations to tighten well-construction and waste-disposal standards and require disclosure of fracking-fluid ingredients, 

sometimes bringing industry and environmental groups together in the process. 
They're also coming up with regulatory systems that fit local conditions. Different rules for different states are necessary to match the local geography -- for example, drillers 
may use different drilling specifications or wastewaster-disposal methods, depending upon the location. 

Remember that states have been overseeing natural-gas development for decades. State oil and gas commissions have much more experience with permitting and overseeing 

natural-gas production than the EPA does. 
Federal-regulation advocates also argue that the current system of multiple state and federal regulators produces a confusing patchwork of rules. But this kind of regulatory 
complexity is the norm in the U.S. 

Few, if any, industries are overseen by a single federal agency. Not surprisingly, neither industry nor the states are clamoring for a single federal permitting regime for the 

fracking industry. 
Some critics have worried about states lowering their standards to attract industry. But states are not competing with one another for limited natural-gas industry jobs and 
capital as they compete for, say, an automotive plant. To the contrary, investment capital will find profitable shale-gas production opportunities wherever they exist. 

Advocates of federal regulation point to the case of coal mining, which Congress regulates based on its national importance. But coal mining and combustion produces health 

and environmental risks that dwarf those associated with natural-gas production. 
By reducing our reliance on coal, the shale-gas boom helped push U.S. carbon emissions in the first quarter of 2012 to their lowest point since 1992 -- reflecting fewer 
emissions not just of carbon but of other byproducts of coal combustion that kill tens of thousands of people a year. 

We need to continue to study fracking, and to ensure that it is done safely. Fracking offers the prospect of economic and environmental benefits, but it also presents 

environmental risks. 
Each state is balancing those benefits and risks in its own way. Some are taking a cautious approach; others are embracing the economic benefits of shale gas more eagerly. We 
should continue to let states devise local solutions to what are mostly local problems.

Abstract 
The Environmental Protection Agency, which says the rule will cost considerably less, is expected to say Friday that it wants to reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline to an average of 10 parts per million, down from the current standard of 30 ppm, people briefed on the plan said. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is moving forward with tough new standards to cut pollution from cars, prompting an outcry from refiners who say the proposal 

could raise the cost of producing gasoline by nearly 10 cents a gallon. 
The Environmental Protection Agency, which says the rule will cost considerably less, is expected to say Friday that it wants to reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline to an 
average of 10 parts per million, down from the current standard of 30 ppm, people briefed on the plan said. 

The plan, which still must go through public comment before becoming final, would give environmentalists one of the top items on their wish list at a time of disappointment on 
some other fronts. 

"I think this proposal is the single most effective step EPA can take right now to reduce smog," said Clean Air Watch president Frank O'Donnell. 
Whether the tougher standards would have a big impact on everyday drivers at the pump is a matter of debate. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents refiners, 
says the standards would cost $10 billion in upfront capital expenditures and an additional $2.4 billion in annual compliance costs. The standards would ultimately raise the price 
of producing gasoline by up to nine cents a gallon, the institute says, and that extra cost would likely be passed on to consumers. 

"The costs are significant and could easily impact the competitiveness of U.S. refineries," said Bob Greco, a director at the institute. 

A senior administration official said a tighter sulfur standard would affect the price of gasoline by only a penny a gallon. That official said the refiners' analysis doesn't take into 
account ways in which the rule will provide flexibility to the industry -- by allowing, for example, longer compliance times for smaller facilities. 
Of the 111 refineries in the U.S., the EPA estimates 29 can already meet the tighter standard and 66 can do so with relatively modest improvements, the administration official 

said. 

Sulfur, a natural ingredient in crude oil, reduces the performance of a car's catalytic converter, a critical piece of emissions-control equipment. Low-sulfur gasoline enables that 
equipment to operate more efficiently. 
The proposal is also expected to impose new tailpipe emissions standards on cars starting with model year 2017 vehicles, requiring car makers to install better-performing 

catalytic converters. 

Auto makers have said they are generally on board with the EPA's plan because they already face similar requirements in more than a dozen states, including California. Also, 
lower-sulfur gasoline makes it easier for auto makers to meet their requirements. 
EPA officials have been working on the proposal for well over a year, and the standard was initially expected in early 2012. Gasoline prices were rising at the time, and 

Republican candidates on the campaign trail were criticizing President Barack Obama for policies they said were hurting consumers. 
The new proposal would replace a standard adopted by the Clinton administration in 2000. That rule for the first time set a sulfur limit. 
House Republicans have warned that increasing fuel costs will hurt businesses and consumers. Their colleagues on the Senate side are likely to press Gina McCarthy, the 

nominee to head the EPA, for details on the proposal when she undergoes a confirmation hearing later this year. Ms. McCarthy, EPA's clean-air chief, would replace former 

Administrator Lisa Jackson. 
Mr. Obama also faces pressure from environmentalist supporters to do more about pollution. He has failed to get climate-change legislation through Congress. And many 
environmentalists worry he may approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada later this year, after his State Department issued a generally favorable environmental report 
on it earlier this month. 

What is more, an EPA plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants -- a proposal that would have effectively ruled out new coal-fired power plants using 
conventional technology -- is unlikely to be finished by a deadline in April, and many in the power sector say the rule proposal has hit a snag.

Full Text 
Bjorn Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. 
-- On reducing the demand for fossil fuels: We've been tackling global warming badly for 20 years. And for a very simple reason: because we essentially try to tell people, "Could you please stop with all that fossil-fuel stuff?" 
The problem, of course, is fossil fuels are what power pretty much everything we like about civilization. We're not burning fossil fuels to annoy Al Gore. We're burning them because it makes us rich. Trying to tell people not to do that is a hard sell. 
When we've tried, for instance, in Europe to cut carbon emissions, we cut minuscule amounts at very high costs. And that's the real damage. In the long run, we're not ever going to get that way to go forward. There's a real political risk that we will actually turn people off. 
That's why I think we need to recognize it has to be about innovation instead. If we focus on making green energy so cheap that eventually everyone will want it, then we can get everybody on board, and we can do so very, very cheaply. So, we can spend less money and do much more good by investing in research and development, rather than focusing on what has failed for the last 20 years. 
-- On priorities in the developing world: China has lifted 600 million people out of poverty over the last 30 years, and they did it with coal. They've been explicit about saying, "We'd rather cough a little more and have more people out of poverty." So, it's not a clean economy. It's running on coal. That's how we got rich, and that's how they're going to get rich. 
Now, that's not going to continue. They're going to solve it with cleaner technology and, eventually, green energy. We need to make sure the technology is there so they will use it, or get them on board to make it.

Abstract 
Burning natural gas emits less carbon than coal, but the standard is so strict that some natural-gas fired power plants would have trouble meeting it, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the main trade association for investor-owned utilities. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- An early step toward President Barack Obama's second-term goal of cutting emissions linked to climate change has hit a snag. 
The Obama administration is weighing changes to a proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule to limit emissions at new power plants, in a preemptive move to protect against possible court challenges, according to people familiar with the matter. The changes may require the EPA to seek more public input, a move that would push the measure months past an April 13 deadline for finalizing it. 
The proposed rule would limit emissions of carbon-dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas that many scientists have linked to a warming planet, to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour of electricity generated at new power plants, whether fired by coal or natural gas. 
The EPA put forth its proposal in March 2012 and immediately drew fire because it would essentially ban new coal-fired power plants that use current technologies. The agency hasn't decided to alter that part of the proposal, but it is weighing concerns that the rule as written may not withstand legal scrutiny, said people who have been briefed on EPA talks. 
The agency has received more than two million public comments, many of which praised the proposal as a way to fight climate change. 
An EPA spokeswoman said Tuesday the agency was reviewing the comments, but declined to comment further. 
The rule affecting new power plants is also important because it could serve as a basis for future regulation on the existing fleet of coal-fired plants, which has even more potential to cut emissions. If a federal court nullified the rules for new plants, curbs on operating plants might also face delays. 
"If they are not careful, the opponents could play the clock out" until the next presidential election, said Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which represents state air-quality officials. 
New coal plants couldn't meet the EPA's proposed standard without storing their carbon emissions underground -- something that hasn't yet happened on a commercial scale. 
Burning natural gas emits less carbon than coal, but the standard is so strict that some natural-gas fired power plants would have trouble meeting it, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the main trade association for investor-owned utilities. 
Last week, four Democratic senators, led by Sen. Joe Manchin from coal-producing West Virginia, wrote to Mr. Obama, pushing for separate standards for coal and natural gas. That could allow utilities to build coal plants as long as they use the most efficient technology available. "Our nation can continue to use coal and continue to lower emissions at the same time," the senators wrote. 
If the EPA adopted two separate standards, it would likely have to withdraw its original proposal and issue a new rule altogether, which could delay a final rule until late this year or later. 
"It's an important rule and it needs to be legally defensible. If the EPA is concerned, it would make sense to repropose it," said Carol Browner, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank, and head of the EPA under President Bill Clinton. 
Alternatively, the EPA could release new data or analysis to bolster its case for the proposed rule. Giving the public a chance to comment on new information would likely take months. The Washington Post earlier reported the proposed rule could be delayed. 
Coal utilities have urged the EPA to consider the economic impact of relying on natural gas. Nick Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power Co., said greenhouse-gas emissions will have to be dealt with, but "today we have a condition where we have an economy that is flat on its back. We have to get this right."

Green Cars Have a Dirty Little Secret

Abstract 
A 2012 comprehensive life-cycle analysis in Journal of Industrial Ecology shows that almost half the lifetime carbon-dioxide emissions from an electric car come from the energy used to produce the car, especially the battery. While electric-car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous, they still recharge using electricity overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels. [...]the life-cycle analysis shows that for every mile driven, the average electric car indirectly emits about six ounces of carbon-dioxide. 

Full Text 
Electric cars are promoted as the chic harbinger of an environmentally benign future. Ads assure us of "zero emissions," and President Obama has promised a million on the road by 2015. With sales for 2012 coming in at about 50,000, that million-car figure is a pipe dream. Consumers remain wary of the cars' limited range, higher price and the logistics of battery-charging. But for those who do own an electric car, at least there is the consolation that it's truly green, right? Not really. 
For proponents such as the actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio, the main argument is that their electric cars -- whether it's a $100,000 Fisker Karma (Mr. DiCaprio's ride) or a $28,000 Nissan Leaf -- don't contribute to global warming. And, sure, electric cars don't emit carbon-dioxide on the road. But the energy used for their manufacture and continual battery charges certainly does -- far more than most people realize. 
A 2012 comprehensive life-cycle analysis in Journal of Industrial Ecology shows that almost half the lifetime carbon-dioxide emissions from an electric car come from the energy used to produce the car, especially the battery. The mining of lithium, for instance, is a less than green activity. By contrast, the manufacture of a gas-powered car accounts for 17% of its lifetime carbon-dioxide emissions. When an electric car rolls off the production line, it has already been responsible for 30,000 pounds of carbon-dioxide emission. The amount for making a conventional car: 14,000 pounds. 
While electric-car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous, they still recharge using electricity overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels. Thus, the life-cycle analysis shows that for every mile driven, the average electric car indirectly emits about six ounces of carbon-dioxide. This is still a lot better than a similar-size conventional car, which emits about 12 ounces per mile. But remember, the production of the electric car has already resulted in sizeable emissions -- the equivalent of 80,000 miles of travel in the vehicle. 
So unless the electric car is driven a lot, it will never get ahead environmentally. And that turns out to be a challenge. Consider the Nissan Leaf. It has only a 73-mile range per charge. Drivers attempting long road trips, as in one BBC test drive, have reported that recharging takes so long that the average speed is close to six miles per hour -- a bit faster than your average jogger. 
To make matters worse, the batteries in electric cars fade with time, just as they do in a cellphone. Nissan estimates that after five years, the less effective batteries in a typical Leaf bring the range down to 55 miles. As the MIT Technology Review cautioned last year: "Don't Drive Your Nissan Leaf Too Much." 
If a typical electric car is driven 50,000 miles over its lifetime, the huge initial emissions from its manufacture means the car will actually have put more carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere than a similar-size gasoline-powered car driven the same number of miles. Similarly, if the energy used to recharge the electric car comes mostly from coal-fired power plants, it will be responsible for the emission of almost 15 ounces of carbon-dioxide for every one of the 50,000 miles it is driven -- three ounces more than a similar gas-powered car. 
Even if the electric car is driven for 90,000 miles and the owner stays away from coal-powered electricity, the car will cause just 24% less carbon-dioxide emission than its gas-powered cousin. This is a far cry from "zero emissions." Over its entire lifetime, the electric car will be responsible for 8.7 tons of carbon dioxide less than the average conventional car. 
Those 8.7 tons may sound like a considerable amount, but it's not. The current best estimate of the global warming damage of an extra ton of carbon-dioxide is about $5. This means an optimistic assessment of the avoided carbon-dioxide associated with an electric car will allow the owner to spare the world about $44 in climate damage. On the European emissions market, credit for 8.7 tons of carbon-dioxide costs $48. 
Yet the U.S. federal government essentially subsidizes electric-car buyers with up to $7,500. In addition, more than $5.5 billion in federal grants and loans go directly to battery and electric-car manufacturers like California-based Fisker Automotive and Tesla Motors. This is a very poor deal for taxpayers. 
The electric car might be great in a couple of decades but as a way to tackle global warming now it does virtually nothing. The real challenge is to get green energy that is cheaper than fossil fuels. That requires heavy investment in green research and development. Spending instead on subsidizing electric cars is putting the cart before the horse, and an inconvenient and expensive cart at that.

Abstract 
Gina McCarthy was picked to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, where she is currently in charge of air quality programs, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Ernest Moniz was named to head the Department of Energy, where he served as undersecretary during the Clinton administration. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama presented his second-term team to handle environmental and energy issues, nominating on Monday a pair of Washington veterans in hopes of avoiding some of the rancor of his first term. 
Gina McCarthy was picked to be administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, where she is currently in charge of air quality programs, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Ernest Moniz was named to head the Department of Energy, where he served as undersecretary during the Clinton administration. 
Both likely will face tough questions in the Senate, but major roadblocks to their confirmation weren't immediately apparent. The nominations are important because Mr. Obama has signaled that if Congress doesn't act, he would use executive authority to advance his goals to curb emissions of greenhouse gases and boost clean energy. The EPA, in particular, will be charged with setting rules to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from new power plants. The president said Monday his nominees will ensure "we're doing everything that we can to combat the threat of climate change." 
The Obama Department of Energy has become a key driver of energy research and deployment of clean-energy technology, and is also adjusting to the sudden transformation of the U.S. into a major oil and gas producer. 
During Mr. Obama's first term, then-EPA chief Lisa Jackson rankled industry with a series of rules to rein in toxic emissions. And Energy Secretary Steven Chu made frequent visits to Congress to explain why his department gave a $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra LLC two years before its bankruptcy. 
Ms. McCarthy, 58 years old, worked on many of the EPA rules under Ms. Jackson and developed a reputation as someone who gave the industry a more careful hearing, according to lobbyists and executives. 
Still, Republicans said they had concerns about her. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, the top Republican on the committee that will hold hearings on her nomination, said the EPA needs "a leader who will stop ignoring congressional information requests, hiding emails and more from the public, and relying on flawed science." 
The committee's chairman, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), praised Ms. McCarthy, as did environmentalists who cited her work as a state regulator under then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Connecticut Gov. Jodi Rell, both Republicans. 
Some environmentalists offered muted praise of Mr. Moniz, 68 years old, who led high-profile studies while at MIT on the future of coal, natural gas and nuclear power. His belief that all major energy sources would be needed during a transition to a cleaner energy future resembles Mr. Obama's "all of the above" policy. 
If confirmed, one of his first big decisions will be whether to authorize significant exports of liquefied natural gas to Japan, Europe and elsewhere. That contentious issue pits oil and gas producers eager for new markets against gas consumers, including chemical companies and steelmakers. 
Mr. Moniz also served on Mr. Obama's blue-ribbon commission on nuclear waste, which last year recommended overhauling the process to find a permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste. Finding a substitute for the now-moribund Yucca Mountain site is a major political issue in Nevada, and Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.) said, "I hope he agrees with me that Yucca Mountain should remain a closed issue." 
Dan Reicher, head of an energy-policy center at Stanford University and a candidate for energy secretary until recently, said Mr. Moniz could build "sorely needed" bridges across different parts of the energy industry. "He knows Washington well and he knows the Department of Energy very well," Mr. Reicher said. "He has the chops to do it."

Abstract 
The rule for existing sources, now under development, would work like this: Because coal and gas are combined in a single category, the EPA would cap an average rate of, say, 1,400 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour. 

Full Text 
President Obama gave his second-term global warming agenda a lot more definition Monday with a new Environmental Protection Agency chief to replace Lisa Jackson. Picking Gina McCarthy, one of her top lieutenants and the architect of some of the agency's most destructive carbon rules, is a sign he intends to make good on his vow of "executive actions" if Congress doesn't pass cap and tax. 
Over the last four years running the EPA's air office, Ms. McCarthy has been a notably willful regulator, even for this Administration. Her promotion is another way of saying that Mr. Obama has given up getting Congress to agree to his anticarbon agenda, especially given the number of Senate Democrats from coal or oil states. The real climate fight now is over the shape of forthcoming rules that could be released as early as this summer, and a brutal under-the-table lobbying campaign is now underway. 
The main target, as usual, is the U.S. power industry, which accounts for 40% of U.S. carbon emissions and about one-third of greenhouse gasses. Last year Ms. Jackson and Ms. McCarthy imposed a moratorium on new coal-fired plants, plus other rules that are forcing utilities to shut down older plants and invest billions of dollars to upgrade everything else. The agency is about to go after the leftovers. 
The moratorium is known as "new source performance standards," which the EPA issued because it declared carbon a dangerous pollutant under the clean-air laws of the 1970s. These standards say that all future power plants running on fossil fuels -- coal or gas -- must not emit more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. 
Even the most modern, efficient coal boiler emits 1,800 pounds, while combined cycle natural gas turbines come in barely under that threshold. To adapt what Henry Ford said about the color of the Model T, utilities can build any plant they like as long as it runs on natural gas. 
This being Washington, new source standards also apply to old sources. But when the EPA issued the diktat last March, it claimed it lacked sufficient information to impose them on existing power plants and heavy manufacturers, refineries and the like. Which is to say the information it did have is that costly new rules in the middle of an election campaign were politically verboten. Now that the election is over, the EPA suddenly knows enough to proceed. 
The rule for existing sources, now under development, would work like this: Because coal and gas are combined in a single category, the EPA would cap an average rate of, say, 1,400 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour. In this hypothetical, that would allow a utility to run one coal plant and one gas plant -- but the average would decline over time. As it fell, the utility would need to switch to more gas and retire coal. The standards for new plants explicitly refer to natural gas as a "system of emission reduction," when in fact it is a system of emission generation. 
If the EPA adopts the proposals that such green groups as the Natural Resources Defense Council are lobbying for, utilities that phase out their coal operations early would generate credits they could sell to other operators to keep their coal plants running longer. If that sounds like cap and trade -- well, yes, that's the point. 
The White House is trying to fracture industry opposition and peel off companies that stand to profit -- namely, the ones that have already switched to gas and could sell the credits to other utilities. It is also saying that carbon trading is more "flexible" than unit-by-unit command and control. This is Mr. Obama's version of Jack Benny's old "your money or your life" routine, except without the punch line. 
The average rates could also vary from utility to utility or state to state, whatever is more useful for bribes or punishment. These new source performance standards for the existing electric portfolio might also be the only "executive action" that would mollify the environmental lobby if Mr. Obama does eventually approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The greens may not be able to stop the Canadians from extracting oil from the Alberta tar sands, but they would succeed in wiping out American coal-fired power. 
Lately Mr. Obama has been going around saying that the problem is that he's a President, not an "emperor" or "dictator," but on carbon regulation this is a distinction without much difference. Ms. McCarthy has been integral in abusing laws that were written decades ago in order to achieve climate goals that Congress has rejected, all with little or no political debate. Someone should ask her about her antidemocratic politics at her confirmation hearings.

No More Keystone Excuses

Abstract 
Even if the oil sands were shut down entirely, Gulf Coast refineries would merely use the similarly heavy oil from Venezuela, also shipped via tankers. [...]the issue is not whether the oil will flow but how much Americans will benefit. "Mother Nature filed her comments last year -- the hottest year in American history; the top climate scientists in the U.S. have already chimed in," said Bill McKibben in reaction to the report. 

Full Text 
President Obama's spokesmen claim that cutting $43 billion out of a $3.8 trillion federal budget this year will be an economic disaster, though investors seem unconcerned. But if Mr. Obama wants shovel-ready spending stimulus today, why doesn't he finally approve the Keystone XL pipeline? It won't cost taxpayers a dime. 
On Friday the pipeline from Canada through six U.S. states to the Gulf Coast received another boost when a State Department study found there would be no significant damage to the environment. This follows Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman's endorsement in January of a revised pipeline route that now skirts around the Sand Hills region of his state. All of which means the White House has run out of excuses to keep delaying approval of a $5.3 billion private investment that would provide some 16,000 direct jobs and more downstream. 
The State Department study, the fourth such U.S. review in four years, found once again that the pipeline wouldn't make much difference to climate change. The Alberta tar sands are the world's third largest reservoir of oil, and Canada is going to develop them one way or another. 
All told the oil sands contribute a mere 0.01% of global carbon emissions, and if that sort of thing bothers you, Canada is offsetting that with carbon-reduction policies elsewhere. State's report concludes that the pipeline would result in "no substantial change in global greenhouse gas emissions." 
If the Alberta oil doesn't flow south to America via the Keystone XL, it will flow west to China via other pipelines or rail. It will also flow to the Gulf Coast by other means, including pipelines and rail to East Coast ports, and then via tankers in the Atlantic and around Florida. Keystone XL will have a smaller "carbon footprint" than these alternatives. 
As for the danger of spills, the high-tech pipeline will be buried underground and contain valves that allow for rapid detection and shutoff. The environmental risk is arguably greater on a tanker. Even if the oil sands were shut down entirely, Gulf Coast refineries would merely use the similarly heavy oil from Venezuela, also shipped via tankers. 
Thus the issue is not whether the oil will flow but how much Americans will benefit. A rule of thumb is that for every dollar of imported foreign oil, North America receives about 10 cents of the economic benefit. The Venezuelans, Saudis and others get the rest. The benefit from oil produced in North America is roughly 80-90 cents of each $1. This includes the cost of producing and transporting the oil, and the ancillary jobs and sales that flow from it. The Keystone XL has also reserved space for about 250,000 barrels a day of oil produced in the U.S., which means a new and environmentally safer outlet for oil from the booming Bakken fields of North Dakota. 
All of this was known two years ago, but Mr. Obama opposed the project in 2011 to appease the Sierra Club and his other green financial donors while running for re-election. The pipeline's builder, TransCanada, applied again with a new route, and now the President faces another choice. 
His labor supporters favor the pipeline, which will provide thousands of union jobs. His green supporters don't much care about jobs because they are already rich. They are also impervious to evidence like that in the State Department report because global warming is their religion. 
"Mother Nature filed her comments last year -- the hottest year in American history; the top climate scientists in the U.S. have already chimed in," said Bill McKibben in reaction to the report. He's the leader of the anti-Keystone forces who was arrested last month after chaining himself to the White House gate. 
The opponents' goal is to shut down all fossil-fuel production, one step at a time. They're on the way to destroying the U.S. coal industry, and the Sierra Club has made shale-gas drilling its next political target. They want the world economy to run on windmills and solar panels. And these are the folks who denounce Republicans for ignoring science. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry need to think about the impact of rejection on U.S.-Canada relations. One of the better economic stories of the last 50 years has been the integration of the North American economy, including the free flow of goods, investment and to some extent people. Rejection of the pipeline would be an insult to Canada and a step back from that integration. 
The larger issue is whether the U.S. wants to continue to be considered a serious economic nation with rising living standards and a modern energy supply. If Mr. Obama turns down Keystone XL, the Chinese will be laughing at us as they buy Canadian oil and build their economic power, while America adapts to the Sierra Club's preferred future of the world as Walden Pond.

Abstract 
In theory, ordinary salt should act as a binding agent for water vapor in tropical clouds, helping to amass droplets that will eventually fall as rain. 

Full Text 
ABOVE WEST JAVA, Indonesia -- On a recent Sunday, a team of government scientists in a small Navy plane rose to an altitude of 12,000 feet over a corner of Java to meet an enormous cumulus cloud. 
"That's the one that we want," said one of them, Sunu Tikno, directing the pilots to chart a course into the cloud. As the view went blank, four men in the cargo bay poured dozens of bags of salt, one ton in all, into the sky, their contribution to the world's first known effort to use cloud seeding to try to prevent flooding. 
The sortie, to avert floods in greater Jakarta, home to more than 25 million, was one of several that day that spread nine tons of salt into monsoon skies over Java, part of a 60­day, government-led effort with a price tag of $1.35 million. 
In the past, Russia and China have staged attempts to avert rain during high-profile events. Beijing famously fired seeding agents from rockets to try to ensure a rain-free opening ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. But the Indonesian operation appears to be the first to seek to manipulate clouds to release rain before they reach densely populated areas prone to flooding. The effort faces skeptics, including some scientists who say seeding clouds in one area doesn't necessarily mean it will rain less somewhere else. 
But as concerns grow that climate change will lead to more extreme weather, interest in weather modification has picked up around the world. Weather-modification programs also may have business implications. Some of Indonesia's biggest coal-mining companies -- whose open-pit mines are regularly forced to shutter operations when precipitation makes work conditions too slippery -- are closely watching the cloud-seeding efforts. 
The Jakarta team has so far targeted about a 30% reduction in rainfall by means of a weather-modification technique known as hygroscopic cloud seeding. In theory, ordinary salt should act as a binding agent for water vapor in tropical clouds, helping to amass droplets that will eventually fall as rain. In practice, whether that process can be used to divert rain has been little studied. 
Indonesia's move comes after Jakarta was hit by its worst floods in years in January, displacing more than 40,000 people and costing businesses more than $1 billion in losses. 
"There has been a big resurgence of interest lately" in weather-modification efforts, says Hugh Willoughby, a professor at Florida International University. In the early 1980s, Mr. Willoughby was among the scientists to pull the plug on Project Stormfury, a two-decade U.S. study that concluded that cloud seeding probably couldn't be used to weaken hurricanes. He says new science and methods of looking into clouds have convinced many to revisit the field. 
"It's not a crazy idea," he says of Jakarta's program. "What the Indonesians want to do could work." 
In the U.S. and Canada, private investors have spent heavily over the years to attract rain or snow to farms, river basins and ski resorts. China's weather-modification program, the world's largest, employs tens of thousands of people to stave off drought and help crops. 
Rain-diversion efforts are much less common. Russia seeds skies over Moscow several times a year during national events; it also tried to seed clouds to reduce snowfall for a spell in the 1980s. Both Russia and China say their efforts have been successful, but scientists have dismissed any success as coincidence. 
Joe Golden, a weather-modification expert who once chaired the now-defunct Atmospheric Modification Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, calls the Indonesian effort "a very risky enterprise, at best," noting that some evidence suggests that cloud seeding can produce more, not less, rain. 
Nevertheless, Indonesia's disaster-mitigation agency that is funding the program believes it is working. This week, it declared victory in Jakarta and moved the program to Central Java, where it hopes to curb dangerous mudflows on one of the world's most active volcanoes, Merapi, and to reduce flood risk in a region home to tens of millions of people. 
"It's like going to a doctor for the flu," says Tri Handoko Seto, the meteorologist leading the effort. "You get the medicine and three days later you feel better. But was it really the medicine that made the difference? You can't say for certain." 
He has at least a month to convince skeptics that what he is doing is working. But importantly for the future of the program, he has the backing of Jakarta's new governor, Joko Widodo, a forestry graduate who says he wants the program to continue next year. 
"The city's been flooding for 40 years," Mr. Widodo said. "We need to try everything."

What the Oil Business Could Learn From the NRA

Abstract 
If the firearms folks had responded like the fossil-fuel industry, the manufacturers of bolt-action rifles would have been overjoyed to see semiautomatic rifles banned. According to reports this week, the natural-gas boon from fracking could be a boon to the U.S. economy for 30 years, if the industry doesn't fumble the opportunity. 

Full Text 
Watching the political and scientific debates concerning energy and the environment for the past 20 years has led me to one conclusion: The fossil-fuel industry -- which could be the most powerful lobby in Washington -- is hopelessly ineffective and self-defeating. 
I once attended a lecture by the CEO of a major oil company. The gentleman explained that global warming was "real," that the science behind it was sound, and that his company was doing everything possible to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. 
He then complained that the U.S. government would not grant his company leases to drill for petroleum on the continental shelves. He seemed oblivious to the fact that the government was doing what he said he wanted: reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by discouraging oil production. The point had already been conceded. 
Fossil-energy companies could learn a thing or two from the gun lobby. The gun industry is tiny compared with theirs, yet it is among the most respected and powerful groups that lobby Congress. 
After the horrific school shooting in Newtown, Conn., Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, didn't budge an inch. He never agreed to the premise that firearms were inherently evil. Instead, he went on television and suggested that putting armed guards in schools might be an effective way of stopping evil. In other words, he refused to cede the moral high ground. 
Much of the gun lobby's strength springs from solidarity. The Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show is the largest exhibition of its type in North America. It typically has about 1,500 exhibitors, attracts some 200,000 people, and adds millions of dollars to the economy in Harrisburg, Pa. 
On Jan. 15, the show sponsors announced that AR-15 rifles would be banned from their exposition. Almost immediately, exhibitors began to pull out. Some of the exhibitors who withdrew not only did not sell AR-15 rifles, they didn't sell guns at all. Others were small companies that suffered significant financial losses from withdrawing. But they understood that the long-term health of their industry depended on absolute solidarity. When the number of withdrawals exceeded 200, the sponsors canceled the entire exposition. 
If the firearms folks had responded like the fossil-fuel industry, the manufacturers of bolt-action rifles would have been overjoyed to see semiautomatic rifles banned. They would have attempted to exploit the political situation for short-term financial gain. But this didn't happen. 
Firearms manufacturers are well aware that if semiautomatic rifles are banned, bolt-action guns are next. It is a mistake to cede a millimeter on any issue, because it simply invites more demands. People in the gun culture know their opposition. 
Consider, by way of contrast, the foolish actions of Chesapeake Energy, a major producer of natural gas. Time magazine revealed last year that Chesapeake gave the Sierra Club $26 million. Presumably the Machiavellian reasoning was that the Sierra Club would use this money to attack Chesapeake's competitor, the coal industry. 
Now the Sierra Club is trying to shut down hydraulic fracturing -- the entire basis of Chesapeake's natural-gas business. According to reports this week, the natural-gas boon from fracking could be a boon to the U.S. economy for 30 years, if the industry doesn't fumble the opportunity. 
If Chesapeake's managers had understood the environmental movement, they never would have subsidized Sierra Club. 
The oil industry's failure to emphatically push back against the environmentalist attempts to block the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada is no more inspiring. 
Environmentalists don't think like engineers, nor are they conservationists. Modern environmentalism is based on emotionalism, biocentrism and the myth of primitive harmony. Understanding the environmental movement necessarily entails a study of subjects like philosophy and history. But fossil-fuel companies have never appreciated the importance of these subjects. 
If the fossil-fuel industry were willing to change, they could become the most influential political lobby in the U.S. Three things are necessary. First, absolute solidarity. Second, an in-depth knowledge of the environmental movement. Third, fossil-energy companies have to seize the moral high ground. Providing 80% of the energy that sustains human civilization is nothing to apologize for.

Europe's flagship effort to fight global warming is faltering, despite an effort Tuesday by European parliamentarians to bolster the regional emissions-trading system, as the 
Continent's governments struggle to balance environmental priorities and pressing economic concerns. 
Prices for polluting have plummeted, the result of an oversupply of emissions permits in the European carbon-trading market and slackening demand for electricity amid the 
Continent's economic woes -- a development that is calling into question the effectiveness of similar programs world-wide. 

With the cost of emitting carbon dioxide at around 5 euros ($6.68) a ton, a third of what it was 18 months ago, utilities in the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland have largely 

lost the incentive to pollute less, and are reconsidering plans to phase out coal-fired plants. 
On Tuesday, a committee of the European Parliament moved ahead with a plan aimed at shoring up the market, known as the European Union Emissions Trading System, or 
ETS, and keeping prices from falling further. The committee delayed the release of 900 million new emissions allowances by up to five years. One permit, or one allowance, 
equals the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. 

But despite the committee's action, permit prices slipped further, ending the day Tuesday at 4.58 euros after closing Monday at 5.12 euros. 

Making it more expensive to pollute by requiring companies to buy emissions permits is central to the EU's goal of reducing emissions by 20% in 2020 from 1990 levels. But it 
would also be an unwelcome drag on a struggling economy. 
That has turned decision-making on the permit plan into a tug of war between those more concerned with sparking growth and those arguing that the EU shouldn't lose sight of 

longer-term environmental goals as part of the international effort to stem global warming. 

"There is a disparity between the economic priorities and challenges that Europe is facing and reaching more aggressive emissions reductions," said Divya Reddy, a Washington-
based analyst for Eurasia Group who follows climate change. 
In Tuesday's vote, EU politicians mustered enough votes for the ETS lifeline plan to move forward, but were unable to agree on much more than that. 
Among those arguing most loudly for the primacy of economic concerns is Poland. Polish Environment Minister Marcin Korolec said his government opposes any effort to 

increase the price of permits. Higher permit prices would make electricity more expensive and threaten his country's economy, which is experiencing a sharp slowdown in growth and rising unemployment, he said. "The ETS was designed as a market mechanism. I believe that it should continue to be operated based on market rules," Mr. Korolec said. 
Gunther Oettinger, the European energy commissioner, on Monday voiced concerns that EU governments wouldn't be able to agree on the proposed changes. 
The longer the process drags on, the further permit prices could slip, some traders said. 
EU member states auction off about 60 million allowances a month, according to Milan Hudak, a carbon trader at Virtuse Group Suisse. 
Over the past five years, the price of permits has dropped from a high of 28.70 euros a ton before the global financial crisis started in 2008 to below 3 euros a ton last month 

when the European Parliament's industrial committee rejected the plan to delay allowances. 

Jan Pravda, director of Pravda Capital Partners, a trader of the allowances, said the problem is that if allowance prices rise, European manufacturers could move operations to 
countries that lack nationwide emissions-trading systems, such as China or the U.S. 
The question is: How deep will the cuts in the number of allowances have to be to get the market functioning effectively again? 
"Temporarily taking 900 million tons off the market is too little too late," Mr. Pravda said. "The real oversupply is several billion tons." 
One possibility is for the EU to set minimum prices for permits, an approach taken by California. A minimum price could prevent another crash, Ms. Reddy of Eurasia Group said. 

"But from a political perspective it looks unlikely," she added.

Abstract 
In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Obama called on Congress to construct a "bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change," citing specifically an approach Republican Sen. John McCain and then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman advanced several years ago. 

Full Text 
One of President Barack Obama's trickiest political tasks early in his second term has nothing to do with taxes, budget or the debt ceiling. Rather, it will be his decision this spring on whether to give the go-ahead to the Keystone XL pipeline. 
Keystone XL -- the proposed new spur of a pipeline that would carry heavy crude oil from Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast -- was splitting Mr. Obama's Democratic coalition even before it became highly politicized when a decision was put off during last year's presidential campaign. 
Now, the temperature is rising. Environmentalists, whose admiration for Mr. Obama is about matched by their hatred of the pipeline and the oil it would transport, were busy over the weekend protesting in Washington in an attempt to stop the pipeline. 
Still, unions back the idea because of the construction and refining jobs it could create, and nine Democratic senators have joined 44 Republicans in a letter asking for approval. There is ample reason to think the second-term Obama White House, seeing openings to shake America's dependence on Middle East oil, would like to find a way to give the green light. 
And if that's so, a combination of forces are lining up in a way that should make it possible for Mr. Obama to get to a "yes" answer, while limiting the political fallout. One argument Mr. Obama can muster for Keystone XL is that the delay in approval that he ordered last year has worked, at least as far as environmental concerns go. It bought time for a change that addresses a principal worry, which was the route of the pipeline. 
Initially, the pipeline was to go through Nebraska's ecologically sensitive Sand Hills region. Even within deep-red Nebraska, environmental concerns about that route ran high enough to create a roadblock. Now, the route has been changed. A Nebraska state agency said last month the environmental risks of this new route would be "minimal," and Republican Gov. Dave Heineman just gave it a green light. 
Environmental groups aren't concerned merely with the route of the pipeline, of course, but with its very reason for existence: its use in facilitating the further burning of oil, and specifically oil extracted from Canada's tar sands, which is dirtier than average to produce. 
But on this front, the pipeline's symbolic importance outstrips its practical impact. Stopping Keystone won't stop Canada from producing the oil. The Canadians have too much invested in oil-sands extraction to simply stop. 
One likely effect of shutting down the pipeline -- aside from deeply straining U.S.-Canadian relations -- would be to divert the same oil into exports to Asia, for use by China, a country that is doing far less on other fronts to deal with climate change and dirty auto emissions than is the U.S. More immediately, tar-sands oil still would find its way to the 
U.S. by other routes -- rail, truck and other pipelines -- meaning its use won't be extinguished, but the efficiency by which it is brought to market would be diminished. 
More important, though, is the broader environmental backdrop of the Keystone decisions. The U.S. is starting to make meaningful progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, despite the hard reality that it can't yet shake its addiction to oil. 
Thanks to a combination of forces -- the increasing use of relatively clean natural gas, improved energy efficiency and, yes, a world-wide recession -- the U.S. actually is on track to meet its goal of reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, a goal Mr. Obama laid out in late 2009. The U.S. is outpacing Europe in reducing carbon emissions. 
Which opens the door to the real path Mr. Obama can travel in selling Keystone XL approval to his party's base. It is possible to combine Keystone with other environmental moves to show that progress in cutting greenhouse gases will continue even as the pipeline is built. 
In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Obama called on Congress to construct a "bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change," citing specifically an approach Republican Sen. John McCain and then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman advanced several years ago. But if Congress doesn't act, Mr. Obama said, he would explore "executive actions" to reduce pollution and address climate change. That suggests the president would consider moving beyond an existing Environmental Protection Agency proposal to regulate emissions from new power plants and perhaps put new limits on emissions from existing coal-powered plants. 
Whatever the president has in mind specifically, it should be easier to sell Keystone XL if that decision is paired with one showing that the progress the U.S. already has made on climate change will continue, even if the U.S. can't soon kick its oil habit. That is precisely the picture Mr. Obama ought to be able to paint as the big decision point nears.

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is moving toward naming a veteran clean-air expert to head the Environmental Protection Agency, in a signal of his intent to make climate change a priority in his second term. 
Gina McCarthy, a 58-year-old Boston native who once worked for Gov. Mitt Romney, has emerged as the top contender to take over the EPA, according to people familiar with the matter. She would formally succeed Lisa Jackson, who officially left the agency's top post Thursday. 
A McCarthy nomination would likely face opposition from Republicans, over the agency's actions in general and the role she played in directing them. And while business groups generally see her as an EPA official they can work with, coal producers and owners of coal-fired power plants are worried about potential EPA greenhouse-gas rules. 
Ms. McCarthy has led the EPA's clean-air division for the past four years and has pushed through some of Mr. Obama's most significant environmental rules, including higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars. 
She has already been a central player in developing greenhouse-gas rules proposed last year that would effectively rule out new coal-fired power plants using existing commercially viable technology. 
The agency in the next year or two is likely to decide what to do about existing coal-fired plants, the largest stationary source of greenhouse-gas emissions. Critics say such rules could threaten the reliability of the power grid and raise consumer electricity prices. 
Last year, Ms. McCarthy said the risks from climate change were "substantial and far-reaching," a message that has been amplified by the president in his second inaugural and State of the Union addresses. Mr. Obama said at the State of the Union that he would direct his administration to tackle climate change through executive action if, as expected, Congress fails to pass legislation cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The EPA declined to comment about the selection of Ms. Jackson's successor. The people familiar with the matter said the choice of Ms. McCarthy hasn't been made final yet. EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe has also been named as a possible successor to Ms. Jackson. Mr. Perciasepe, 61, will serve as acting administrator until a permanent chief is confirmed. 
The top Republican on the Senate committee that will consider the EPA nomination, Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, expressed his frustration with getting the agency to answer his requests for the scientific basis for its rules. "The administration should be looking for someone who will end the standard of ignoring congressional requests, undermining transparency and relying on flawed science. Instead, it looks like they may double down on that practice," he said. 
Ms. McCarthy won praise from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) who worked with her when both were Connecticut state officials. "She recognizes that sometimes there's a balance that has to be struck between environmental emphasis and economic growth, but she's convinced the two are often mutually supportive," Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. 
While working for Mr. Romney, Ms. McCarthy was part of the push by Northeast states to force the EPA to take action on greenhouse-gas emissions. The fight led to a landmark 2007 Supreme Court decision that said greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The decision serves as the bedrock of the EPA's current work to regulate carbon emissions. 
Some industry officials view Ms. McCarthy as a less polarizing figure than Ms. Jackson and say it is better to have an experienced regulator at the helm than an outsider. 
"We have a decent relationship with Gina McCarthy," said Nick Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power, a Columbus, Ohio-based utility that relies heavily on coal-fired power plants. "She seems receptive, but I don't know what that means in the end" for the shape of future regulation, he said. 
Ms. McCarthy gets credit among industry lobbyists for playing a central role in lowering costs for power plants complying with a strict new rule on mercury and other toxic emissions. The final rule was more flexible than the one initially proposed and required fewer plants to install pollution controls or shut down.

Abstract 
[...]any actions by the administration on climate change would likely take shape through executive actions such as the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of power plants under the Clean Air Act or mandates to improve efficiency in the energy and transportation industries. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Businesses are weighing how to prepare for potential new rules on climate change, after President Barack Obama has repeatedly promised to make the issue a priority in his second term. 
Mr. Obama is expected to flesh out in his State of the Union address on Tuesday the broad-brush approach he outlined in his inaugural speech in January. 
In the energy sector, some businesses, especially those heavily invested in carbon-intensive power sources, stand to lose if the government acts aggressively to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Others, including firms that sell alternative energy or gear to clean up power plants, sense an opportunity. 
For the broader business community, the possibility of new rules brings worries about the potential impact on energy prices. Still, plenty of companies, including railroads such as CSX Corp. and big industrial conglomerates such as General Electric Co., could see upsides as well as downsides. 
Todd Recknagel, chief executive of AM Conservation Group Inc. in Charleston, S.C., sells energy- and water-conservation equipment to utilities and other customers. He said his company has benefited as more states put in mandates to hold down electricity usage, but he expressed fears that more aggressive plans at the federal level could hurt the economy. 
"A lot of the additional regulations that we put on the country come at a cost," he said. "I'm concerned about the global-warming fear agenda." 
Early in his first term, Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to push broad legislation through Congress to cap greenhouse-gas emissions, but such a move is unlikely today because of opposition in the Republican-controlled House. Instead, any actions by the administration on climate change would likely take shape through executive actions such as the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of power plants under the Clean Air Act or mandates to improve efficiency in the energy and transportation industries. 
The president also faces a big choice this year on the Keystone XL pipeline. Environmentalists are urging him to reject the pipeline, which would carry oil into the U.S. from Canada, saying that tar-sands production is linked to climate change. 
CSX, the big railroad operator, shows how greenhouse-gas regulation can cut both ways. CSX said in its most recent quarterly filing that possible new EPA rules to discourage coal-fired power plants could "adversely affect" its bottom line. It saw a 13% decline in coal-traffic revenues through the first nine months of fiscal 2012. In a separate filing, CSX said efforts to reduce truck emissions could raise demand for less-polluting rail freight. 
Similar opportunities await other companies. Exelon Corp., the biggest operator of emissions-free nuclear power in the U.S., advocates for stricter environmental rules, which would increase costs for its competitors. And Eco Power Solutions, a Quincy, Mass., company that develops technology to clean pollutants from coal-plant exhausts, is eying the market for small existing power plants that can't switch to other fuels. 
"I think people forget coal is still the No. 1 fuel source in the U.S. and abroad for generating electricity, so you have to address emissions with technology," said Kevin Crapsey, Eco Power's vice president of corporate strategy. 
Power companies that rely heavily on coal to generate electricity, including American Electric Power and Southern Co., would suffer more than peers. The EPA is set to come out this spring with final regulations on new power plants, following a proposal last year. 
"If the final rule is anything like the proposed rule, conventional coal generation is just not doable. So they are really making an energy policy statement there," Tom Fanning, chief executive of Southern Co., said last month. He added that EPA rules that raise the cost of energy for regular families end up hurting the broader economy by cutting into disposable income. 
At SwaddleDesigns LLC, a 25-employee wholesaler and retailer of baby products in Seattle, co-founder Jeff Damir said energy prices affected his raw-material costs and the cost of shipping. If fuel costs rise, "it starts to eat into our margins," he said. "We support all policies that keep energy costs low in the U.S."

Abstract 
According to EPA data released Tuesday, power plants account for about one-third of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 

Full Text 
President Barack Obama in next week's State of the Union speech will lay out a renewed effort to combat climate change that is expected to include using his authority to curb emissions from existing power plants, people who have talked to the administration about its plans said. 
The action, building on a pledge in the second inaugural address, fits within Mr. Obama's larger strategy of making full use of his executive authority in areas where Congress is putting up obstacles to his agenda. 
The speech, to be delivered Tuesday, isn't finished. 
Mr. Obama is likely to signal he wants to move beyond proposed Environmental Protection Agency rules on emissions from new power plants and tackle existing coal-fired plants, people familiar with the administration's plans said. 
The EPA has prepared rules for existing plants to minimize pollution from particulate matter, mercury and other toxins. But this would be the first time the agency regulates existing plants to curb emissions of the greenhouse gases scientists believe contribute to global warming. 
"You will ultimately see a proposal from EPA to regulate existing power plants," one person familiar with the matter said. "How he talks about it in the State of the Union could be anything from, 'We've taken important steps and we need to take more,' to 'We need to make more [progress] and the next one on the chopping block is existing sources'" of carbon emissions. 
No final decisions about what the president will propose next Tuesday appear to have been made. A White House spokesman disputed the accounts of discussions surrounding the president's intentions, but declined to be specific. The spokesman said any decision about the issue "would come later in the year." 
Congressional Republicans and businesses have objected to regulating existing plants. Rep. Ed Whitfield (R., Ky.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, who has coal-fired plants in his district, said such a move would be a "serious misstep" and added, "We're going to be very aggressive in letting them know that if they try to start doing this with existing plants, they're going to have a real battle on their hands." 
In the run-up to the speech, Mr. Obama has been "pushing the team to get very specific about how to achieve the goals he set on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions," one former administration official said. 
The president may not announce the specific steps in the speech itself. The White House would not specify what policy steps he might take, but said any steps would likely come later. 
In spring 2012, the EPA proposed strict emissions limits for new power plants. The proposed limits -- 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour of electricity -- would make coal-fired plants all but impossible to build. The average coal-fired plant today, according to the EPA, emits 2,249 pounds per megawatt-hour, about double the average gas-fired plant. The rule is set to be completed later this year. 
The EPA is at an earlier stage in deciding what to do about existing power plants, where the economic consequences are much greater. 
Although coal has ceded ground to natural gas, it remains the top fuel for generating electricity. According to EPA data released Tuesday, power plants account for about one-third of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 
For months, environmentalists have been urging the administration to target emissions from existing plants. 
"Power plants are our largest source of carbon pollution and you have the authority and responsibility to clean them up under the Clean Air Act," environmental groups said in a Jan. 7 letter to the president. The letter also told the president he could "set standards that cut carbon pollution from America's aging power plant fleet at least 25% by 2020 while boosting energy efficiency and shifting to clean energy sources." 
Nick Akins, chief executive of Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power Co., says limiting emissions from existing plants would be "devastating." Utilities already are investing billions of dollars to upgrade old power plants to comply with other EPA rules, but if greenhouse-gas regulations deem those plants too dirty, those investments could be wasted, he says.

U.S. News: Republicans Bristle at Obama's New Roster --- President's Second-Term Team of Like-Minded Allies Draws Complaints From Some Who See Little Room for Compromise

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
President Barack Obama's most recent nominations and appointments show that he is assembling a muscular senior team of trusted allies to carry out his second-term plans, 
without concern for Republican sensitivities, some GOP officials say. 
With his second-term appointments largely complete, the president has built a cadre of officials and aides that some say is more for combat than consensus -- to execute 
policies rooted in the Democratic ideals laid out in his inaugural speech last week. 

By contrast, midway through his first term the president named William Daley as his chief of staff, choosing someone with ties to the corporate world in an overture to 

Republicans and business leaders. 
On Friday, Mr. Obama announced he was naming someone of a different mold as his top aide: Denis McDonough, a longtime deputy with no independent political base, whose 
primary purpose will be to put in place the president's policies. 

Mr. Obama wants to elevate his current chief of staff, Jack Lew, to Treasury secretary, though Republicans soured on Mr. Lew during the 2011 debt-ceiling negotiations. 

Earlier this month, Mr. Obama nominated as his defense secretary former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, whom critics describe as an ersatz Republican who broke party ranks and 
endorsed Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential race. Mr. Hagel will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing. 
Senate Republicans are expected to zero in on Mr. Hagel's vote in opposition to naming the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and to question a 

comment he once made about the "Jewish lobby." 
Appearing Sunday on ABC's "This Week," Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) was asked if, in a private meeting last week, Mr. Hagel had addressed his concerns. 
"Not really," Mr. McCain said. 
Another battle with Republicans may lie ahead: Mr. Obama will soon name a new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and he is likely to choose someone in sync with 

the aggressive approach he hinted at in his inaugural speech. In that address, Mr. Obama gave an unusually prominent warning about the threat of climate change. His best 

option for rolling back greenhouse-gas emissions rests with the EPA, which won recent court cases upholding its authority to regulate the pollutants. 
"You've gone through a lot of legislative achievement in the first term, and execution is everything in a second term," said John Podesta, who has close ties to the White House 
and who served as chief of staff under Bill Clinton. "So he has a clear strategy. . . . And what he needs are people who can execute that strategy." 

Ken Duberstein, who served as chief of staff in Ronald Reagan's second term, said Mr. Obama might rethink his approach and find ways to compromise. "He has to do it if he is 

to accomplish his broad agenda," he said. "You can't just do it by sticking your finger in people's eyes." 
Mr. Obama has four more years in office. But in practical terms, he needs to move quickly to advance his domestic agenda. A re-elected president has finite political capital and 
a compressed period to act before Congress is diverted by the midterm elections and then the next presidential election. 

Were Mr. Obama inclined to reach out to Republicans, he might not have renominated former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In making the Cordray announcement last week, the president renewed a fight with Senate Republicans who have said they want changes in the bureau's structure as the price of confirming a nominee. 
Mr. Obama seems unmoved by that argument, which has angered Republicans. 
Sen. Mike Johanns (R., Neb.), a member of the Senate committee that will conduct Mr. Cordray's confirmation hearing, called the renomination "a troublesome situation." 
More insight into the president's second-term approach may come when he nominates an EPA administrator. Both environmentalists and oil-and-coal industry lobbyists have 

said they would approve of an internal choice, such as Bob Perciasepe, currently the No. 2 EPA official. 
But the president could make a more assertive statement by choosing an official who has waged climate battles, such as former Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire.

U.S. News: On Climate Change, Some Arguments Shift

Abstract 
Just as public concern about climate change bottomed out during the recession, Republican lawmakers warn that any steps by Washington to curb greenhouse-gas emissions -­blamed by many scientists for contributing to climate change -- or to add regulations on fossil fuels such as coal could harm the recovery. 

Full Text 
Climate change is back on the agenda in Washington after President Barack Obama's call to action in his second inaugural address. And while polls suggest that public belief that manmade causes are behind warmer temperatures isn't yet back to the levels seen in the middle of the last decade, concern about climate change is recovering from the economic collapse of 2008-09, which buried the issue under economic worries. 
Among the significant divides in public attitudes is age. In an October poll by the Pew Research Center, younger respondents showed the highest agreement with the view that warming is manmade and that it is a "very serious" problem. Only 28% of respondents 65 and over thought there was solid evidence the earth was warming because of human activity, versus 42% overall. 
For climate-change campaigners and politicians in Washington, those demographics could be significant. As more young people -- even those who are conservative on other issues -- side with those who believe in manmade global warming, it could be easier to find the votes for aggressive action on the climate in Congress, although immediate moves appear unlikely. 
Ben Lowe, one of the founders of an activist network called Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, shows how the issue influences a traditional bastion of Republican support. 
Mr. Lowe, 28 years old, came from a long line of Republicans. But rising temperatures have been especially hard to avoid for him and his peers. "No one under 28 has experienced a cooler-than-average month," he said. "Global warming is all we've ever known." 
Wisconsin native Kelsie Wendelberger knocked on doors to help Republican Gov. Scott Walker in his recall fight, and she said she considers herself conservative. "But it's prudent to manage climate risk," said the 20-year old sophomore at Wheaton College, a Christian school in Illinois. 
She said that from a cost-benefit standpoint, it pays to address climate change. "Look at the numbers," she said. "It would have been better not to have to spend so much on recovery" after superstorm Sandy and other recent events. 
For opponents of sweeping action to fight climate change, generational attitudes matter less than dollars and cents. Just as public concern about climate change bottomed out during the recession, Republican lawmakers warn that any steps by Washington to curb greenhouse-gas emissions -- blamed by many scientists for contributing to climate change -- or to add regulations on fossil fuels such as coal could harm the recovery. 
"It is difficult to understand the everyday cost of these regulations and the climate agenda until you have to pay electric bills, purchase groceries, put gas in your car," said Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.). "Influencing young people is easily accomplished in the academic setting, but many people change their views as they become directly affected by the real-world impacts of these regulations." 
What is more, the age divide isn't enough to change the dynamics in Congress, where lawmakers are well-aware that older voters turn out more frequently and broad action to address global warming isn't on the immediate agenda.

Abstract 
The president's climate shout-out sent the green community into flurries of ecstasy, with grand hopes of a new push for cap-and-trade in Congress, or of a redoubled U.S. commitment to a global carbon pact. The Natural Resources Defense Council this week declared that approving Keystone would be "fundamentally inconsistent" with Mr. Obama's renewed vow to "address climate change." 

Full Text 
President Obama set off a guessing game this week as to what he intended with his inaugural promise to double down on climate change. There's no need to guess. California Democrat Barbara Boxer, the Senate's climate guru, was happy to fill in the gory details. 
The president's climate shout-out sent the green community into flurries of ecstasy, with grand hopes of a new push for cap-and-trade in Congress, or of a redoubled U.S. commitment to a global carbon pact. It fell to Mrs. Boxer to tamp down those ambitions, even as she reassured her devotees that there is more than one way to skin the climate cat. 
"A lot of you press me . . . on: 'Where is the bill on climate change? Where is the bill?' There doesn't have to be a bill," Mrs. Boxer explained in a briefing the day after Mr. Obama's speech. "I'm telling you right now, EPA has the authority in the transportation sector, the electricity sector, and the industrial sector under the Clean Air Act" to do everything that legislation might otherwise do. 
In other words, with the election over, all pretense is gone. Democrats won't waste political capital on a doomed cap-and-trade bill. Yet they'll get their carbon program all the same, by deputizing the EPA to impose sweeping new rules and using their Senate majority to block any GOP effort to check the agency's power grab. The further upside? Brute regulation is not only certain and efficient, it allows vulnerable Democrats to foist any blame on a lame-duck administration. 
Mrs. Boxer has spent years on climate, and she wouldn't be surrendering her legislative ambitions without clear assurances the White House has her covered. Her words were a signal that the Obama EPA is about to re-energize the regulatory machine that it put on ice during the election. Republicans who hoped Lisa Jackson's resignation signaled a more humble EPA approach should instead prepare for an agency with a new and turbocharged mission. 
Just as notable, Mrs. Boxer gave the clearest sign yet that Dems intend to simultaneously pursue the new holy grail of climate control: a carbon tax. The left has been ginning up enthusiasm for this energy tax, not only as a means of cutting fossil-fuel use, but as a way of generating enormous revenue to cover their spending ambitions. The Democrats' political problem, however, is that the tax remains hugely unpopular. 
Mrs. Boxer helpfully detailed Democrats' new strategy for getting a foothold. Now that cars are so much more fuel-efficient, she explained, the gas tax isn't bringing in enough revenue to cover highway needs. How to fix this? Easy! Just replace the gas tax with a carbon tax. 
As strategy goes, this is clever. The gas tax itself is unpopular, so Democrats are betting on some public support for killing it. They figure at least some Republican porksters will salivate at more state highway money. Democrats can initially sell the tax as limited to covering infrastructure, knowing that once the principle is established, they can ramp up. And all this can be silkily pitched as part of "tax reform." 
The only thing Mrs. Boxer did not explain was how the administration intends to balance this climate crackdown with its position atop an American energy renaissance. Mr. Obama spent the past election year bragging that gas and oil production had risen on his watch, hoping to cadge some credit for the economic boom that has accompanied private-sector drilling advances. 
The administration has kept open the possibility of approving the Keystone XL pipeline. It has hinted it will greenlight more export terminals for natural gas. It last week again delayed its fracking rules for public lands. These moves have encouraged the oil-and-gas industry, even as they have driven the environmental community nuts. The Natural Resources Defense Council this week declared that approving Keystone would be "fundamentally inconsistent" with Mr. Obama's renewed vow to "address climate change." 
Or would it? Republicans might recollect that the Obama administration has a practiced method of winning controversial legislation like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank. To wit, it uses a combination of bribes and threats to get pertinent sectors of the business community to back its efforts. 
Consider what the mighty oil-and-gas lobby might be co-opted to do -- either out of gratitude for the president's backing or fear that he might turn on it. Consider how the political environment might change if the industry threw its weight behind a carbon tax or the EPA climate scheme. Consider that this might prove an easy call, given that a tax would be borne by its customers, while EPA regs will mostly crush coal. Consider that numerous Big Oil chieftains have already endorsed such a carbon levy. And who says Mr. Obama has to decide Keystone XL or anything else soon? He could hold out, to see what he can extract in return. 
All this is food for thought for those conservatives who have been lulled into complacency by the stall of cap and trade. A big climate agenda is coming, only on very different terms. If Republicans hope to spare the economy that pain, it's time to adapt.

Abstract 
A surge in natural-gas production has already reduced demand for coal to power electric-generating plants and helped reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions from energy. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama used some of his most impassioned language to date on climate change in his speech Monday, but his policy options are limited after Republicans blocked his approach to the issue in his first term. 
"We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations," Mr. Obama said in his inaugural address. 
"Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms," he said. 
Environmentalists cheered the remarks, hoping that Mr. Obama would press harder to control greenhouse-gas emissions. Republicans, some of whom are skeptical about the extent of global warming or see the cost of tackling it as too high, described his address as lacking in gestures of bipartisanship. 
Mr. Obama began to stress climate change in the later stages of the presidential campaign. He said at the Democratic National Convention that global warming was "not a hoax" and called recent droughts and floods "a threat to our children's future." Since then, he has repeatedly pledged to make the climate a second-term priority. 
Despite Monday's forceful rhetoric, he has few policy options. In 2009, the House, then controlled by Democrats, passed a bill to cap carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions and to introduce an emissions trading system. The bill died in the Democratic-controlled Senate the next year. It has no chance of passing the current House with the GOP in the majority. Likewise, the House GOP is opposed to a tax on carbon. 
That leaves further regulatory action by the Environmental Protection Agency as the likeliest way the president could take steps to curb emissions. 
As early as this spring, the EPA could make final greenhouse-gas emissions rules for new power plants that would effectively rule out new coal-fired plants using the current standard in technology. The EPA is also weighing rules for existing power plants. Mr. Obama's inaugural address left environmentalists who want a strict standard encouraged. 
A surge in natural-gas production has already reduced demand for coal to power electric-generating plants and helped reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions from energy. 
The president also reiterated his support for the American renewable energy industry. "America cannot resist this transition. We must lead it," he said. "We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries. We must claim its promise." 
Mr. Obama's first-term support for solar energy, wind farms and electric-battery technologies came under attack from Republicans. The failure of solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra LLC gave the GOP ammunition to argue that the administration was wasting money on uneconomic technology.

Abstract 
"West Virginia has never had a diverse economy and is largely dependent on natural resources and the subsidiary businesses that support coal and natural gas," said Mary Beth Beller, associate professor and chairman of the political-science department at Marshall University in southwestern West Virginia. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Jay Rockefeller's decision not to seek a sixth Senate term in 2014 will open up a West Virginia Senate seat long held by Democrats but no longer a safe bet for the party. 
Mr. Rockefeller, first elected to his seat in 1984, announced Friday that he wouldn't run again. 
West Virginia has been leaning more conservative in recent years, though Democrats currently hold both Senate seats and the governor's mansion. President Barack Obama was bested by GOP rival Mitt Romney in the state, 62% to 35%, and the Democratic presidential primary, a formality in most of the country, proved an embarrassment for the president when 41% of the vote went to a felon serving time in Texas. 
Still, Sen. Joe Manchin was re-elected in 2012 and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin was elected in 2011. 
Had he decided to stay, the 75-year-old Mr. Rockefeller -- one of the chamber's most liberal members -- would have faced a challenge from Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a conservative who easily won re-election to a seventh term and a day later said she intended to seek the Senate seat. Ms. Capito, the daughter of a former West Virginia governor, is a strong defender of the coal industry. 
Mr. Rockefeller, the great-grandson of industrialist John D. Rockefeller and the last family member holding political office, is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. He has suffered from health problems sporadically for several years, and his announcement came as no surprise to many political analysts. 
The senator openly advocated for federal action to address climate change while promoting the interests of the coal industry, that may not interest any successor. 
West Virginia's economy relies heavily on coal and natural gas at a time when the Obama administration has stepped up regulations on the fossil-fuel industry, a primary reason why Mountain State voters are increasingly hostile to the president. 
"West Virginia has never had a diverse economy and is largely dependent on natural resources and the subsidiary businesses that support coal and natural gas," said Mary Beth Beller, associate professor and chairman of the political-science department at Marshall University in southwestern West Virginia. "There is a natural hostility [by voters] to national leaders that want to improve regulation and environmental efforts, which would likely lead to higher prices for natural resources." 
It is also one of the most fiercely pro-gun states at a time when Washington is looking at tightening gun-control laws following the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. And the West Virginia electorate is socially conservative and largely white, while much of the rest of the country is growing more diverse. 
For all these reasons, Democrats could struggle to retain a seat the party has controlled nearly continuously for more than 60 years, with Mr. Rockefeller's tenure covering the past three decades. 
"At the federal level, West Virginia has become an increasingly Republican state," said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. "[President Bill] Clinton was the last Democrat to carry it in a presidential race. This provides Republicans a real opportunity in an open-seat Senate contest, particularly since they have a very strong candidate in Rep. Shelley Moore Capito." 
Democrats' hopes would likely rest on a candidate similar to Mr. Manchin, who emphasizes his independence from Mr. Obama at every available opportunity and often talks about his socially conservative beliefs. 
Some Democrats mentioned Carte Goodwin, who briefly served in the Senate after Sen. Robert Byrd died in 2010 and was Mr. Manchin's chief counsel when he served in the governor's mansion. Mr. Goodwin has returned to private law practice after his short tenure in the Senate.

Full Text 
In your Jan. 5 editorial "The Kyoto Scorecard" you notes the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol, which sought to limit carbon-dioxide emissions in order to stop increases in global temperature allegedly caused by human activity. 
Unfortunately, you cite various increases in such emissions in contravention of the protocol while neglecting to cite figures on the actual amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the percentage of increase caused by human sources. 
Citing the former, including increases of 20% in the Netherlands, 24% in Canada and 10.3% in the U.S. (which declined to sign the protocol), will only add to the hysteria of calling for carbon taxes and other economically ruinous measures. However, citing the latter will add much-needed rationality to the debate on climate change. 
Carbon dioxide is a trace gas currently occupying less than 4/100ths of 1% of atmospheric volume. Although atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may have doubled since 1950, less than 5% of this increase is attributable to burning of fossil fuels by humankind. This human-caused increase amounts to less than 1/1,000th of 1% of atmospheric volume. The oceans and the so-called "biosphere" -- the amalgam of respiration and decay of living organisms -- account for the overwhelming remainder of this increase. 
Clearly, the national debate on climate change should contemplate these facts and the likely cause of increased carbon emissions from sources other than human consumption of fossil fuels. This likely cause is increased solar activity, which is simultaneously increasing the temperature on Mars. Unless there is an advanced Martian civilization burning vast amounts of coal and oil, global-warming alarmism needs some serious re-evaluation.

Abstract 
[...]it routinely contributes billions in tax revenue each year at the second-highest corporate tax rate in the world. 

Full Text 
Sen. Bernie Sanders's Jan. 3 Letter in defense of the wind industry blows a lot of hot air and deploys an array of smoke and mirrors. 
"Create American jobs" and "help avoid the planetary calamity of global warming," Sen. Sanders offers, except that the real-world record shows that the majority of solar and wind-turbine manufacture has moved to China. Sen. Sanders ignores the fact that renewable-energy imposition needlessly drives the cost of energy up for all consumers. Renewable-energy leader Germany claims such sources provide about 25% of energy needs. What is not mentioned is that it is also building 23 new coal-fired plants; also not mentioned is the number of industries dealing with automatic process shut-downs because of instabilities in grid-power secondary to the erratic nature of solar and wind energy. Last year the German press reported that 600,000 households per year are getting their power cut off because of unaffordable electricity bills. 
Sen. Sanders rants over the tax code and subsidies for conventional power. He decries business write-offs/deductions used by all businesses. He implies unfairness in federal subsidies going to fossil-fuel and nuclear industry, and not to wind energy. He misses the fact that fossil-fuel/nuclear plants deliver reliable power 24/7, unlike intermittent wind and solar, and are a more cost-effective investment. Based on kWh produced per dollar subsidy, renewables are grossly inefficient. 
There is no "calamity of global warming." The U.K. Met Office reports no global warming for the past 16 years, even as CO2 levels rise. Scientists cannot "foresee" the temperatures in 2100 because they do not have validated computer models. Current models produce a variety of answers based on incomplete or erroneous understanding of the inherently chaotic nature of climate, first documented by MIT scientist E. Lorenz in 1964. 
Charles Battig 
Virginia Scientists and Engineers for Energy and Environment

Sen. Sanders utterly confuses subsidies with tax credits. Subsidies are direct payments of government funds to a benefiting entity; tax credits are reductions in the effective tax rates paid by various entities as incentives for various objectives. Exxon Mobil, cited in his letter, receives no "subsidies" whatsoever. In fact, it routinely contributes billions in tax revenue each year at the second-highest corporate tax rate in the world. (No gratitude there from Sen. Sanders.) Much of the remainder is distributed to individual shareholders, pension funds and nonprofit foundations. (None there, either.) 
How strange that liberals always fail to acknowledge a primary source of the funds that enable them. Where there are no profits, there is no tax revenue. 
Gary R. Layton 
Interlaken, N.J. 
Sen. Sanders's sanctimonious defense of federal wind-power subsidies has him looking like a 21st-century Don Quixote in reverse. Instead of tilting at windmills, he is proclaiming that their modern equivalent, the electricity-generating wind turbine, can "help us avoid the planetary calamity of global warming." 
Some 40 years after Cervantes wrote his epic "Don Quixote," the planet entered the coldest depths of the Little Ice Age due to a remarkable lack of sunspots during the years 1645-1715. Despite their benign-sounding name, sunspots are incredibly powerful phenomena. They began a steady increase in annual numbers around 1820 that brought an end to the Little Ice Age around 1870. This increase peaked sharply during the 1950s and still remains above the levels of a century ago, indicating a long-term, natural warming trend. 
A single solar flare associated with a sunspot emits many times the energy of mankind's most powerful nuclear bombs. Such potent disturbances combined with the "solar winds" created by sunspots have been warming the planet for nearly two centuries while secondarily raising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide by reducing the amount absorbed in the oceans. Trying to stop the effects of sunspots with wind turbines is infinitely more futile than jousting at windmills with a medieval lance. 
Moreover, Sen. Sanders's claim that wind power subsidies will provide jobs is rebutted by the modern experiences of Cervantes's native Spain. There, wind-power subsidies have effectively destroyed jobs by funneling taxpayer money into an underproductive industry plagued by the intermittent nature of the wind itself. Natural gas -- now abundant and inexpensive as a result of free enterprise and private investment -- provides a less quixotic alternative for America's energy needs.

U.S. News: Environmentalists Put Heat on Obama --- Temperature Record for 2012 Fuels Call for an Emissions Bill, but Smaller EPA Action Is More Likely

Abstract 
The EPA, which was authorized to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, has proposed strict emissions standards for new power plants that would make the construction of coal-fired power plants, which emit the most greenhouse gases, all but impossible. 

Full Text 
The U.S.'s temperature record for 2012, after a year of extreme weather, is increasing pressure from some scientists and environmentalists on President Barack Obama to take further steps to curb the emissions they say contribute to climate change. 
But congressional opposition and a sputtering economy all but rule out the prospect of sweeping legislation, leaving regulation as the most likely way the administration could try to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Government data this week on the 2012 record high average temperature in the lower 48 states came as global emissions of greenhouse gases keep growing. Many scientists and international energy officials already had expressed concern that last year's extreme events, such as superstorm Sandy and a summertime drought, were caused by climate change. 
"The price tag for dealing with unchecked climate change makes the fiscal cliff look like a crack in the sidewalk," said Angela Anderson, climate director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that advocates action on climate change and sustainable energy. 
Some business leaders, though, worry about the cost of some of the new regulations, especially when developing nations such as China, not the U.S., are the main source of rising emissions. 
Power companies that use coal-fired plants in particular fear a crackdown by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
"While Congress is focused on ways to revive an economy that's tenuous at best, the EPA may be drawing up rules that could damage the economy," said Nick Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power Co., a utility based in Columbus, Ohio. 
Mr. Obama has repeatedly said action on climate change is a second-term priority. During his first term, the administration has put billions of dollars into clean energy, set tough new fuel-economy standards and proposed to make future power plants cleaner than today's. 
Those steps, combined with the recession and a flood of cheap natural gas that has made power generation cleaner, have helped reduce U.S. carbon emissions from the energy sector to 20-year lows. 
However, more ambitious climate plans came to naught, most notably a bill to cap greenhouse-gas emissions that passed the House in 2009 but died in the Senate. 
Now, amid opposition from Republicans and also some Democrats from coal and manufacturing states, there is no prospect of passing a big bill on emissions. Internationally, years of climate conferences under the auspices of the United Nations have failed to figure out how to include large emitters of greenhouse gases, such as China and India, in any global climate deal -- which makes any domestic action on climate change that much tougher to sell politically. The White House also has said that it won't introduce a plan to tax carbon, an idea favored by many economists and even some Republicans. 
Still, Mr. Obama has repeatedly pledged to focus on the climate, both on the campaign trail and after Congress's New Year's budget deal. "Climate change will be a priority in his second term," said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. 
"You don't just keep saying this, unless you are preparing the ground for action," said David Doniger, the climate director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports stronger carbon curbs. 
In the absence of a broad bill, what is left is further EPA action as well as smaller measures such as energy-efficiency rules for new buildings and appliances. The EPA, which was authorized to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, has proposed strict emissions standards for new power plants that would make the construction of coal-fired power plants, which emit the most greenhouse gases, all but impossible. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said it would fight to overturn any rules on new power plants. 
Many environmentalists want the administration to tackle existing power plants, too. But big power companies that burn coal for electricity already say they are at a disadvantage to competitors that can use cheap natural gas. 
Some utilities that use mainly cleaner fuels, such as Exelon Corp., have generally been supportive of EPA air-quality rules.

New York's Fracking Phobia

Abstract 
The more U.S. power plants burn natural gas instead of coal, the less particulate pollution and carbon dioxide are put into the atmosphere. 

Full Text 
Most Americans by now know about the natural gas revolution and its potential. It's become possible through a process called hydraulic fracturing, whereby water and chemicals are used to force previously unrecoverable deposits from shale rock. The technology is bringing new wealth to workers in many states. Except New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo seems content to let the people in the depressed counties of upstate New York watch the rest of the country benefit from fracking. 
The state's Department of Environmental Protection is expected to finish an environmental review in February and perhaps issue drilling regulations by the end of that month. Theoretically this would end a four-year moratorium on fracking. 
But Mr. Cuomo said recently that he'll have to await word from a newly appointed health review board. His appointees are being cheered by drilling critics, perhaps because they have previously criticized the health risks of fracking. The process of delays gives the strong impression that Mr. Cuomo is looking for a pretext to keep the ban in place. Fracking opponents have vowed to mount legal challenges to any regulatory green light, and the industry is now saying 2013 looks like it will be a lost year in New York. 
Fracking was a major issue last year in local elections upstate, where candidates in favor of it trounced those opposed. We doubt residents of these areas are eager for an environmental catastrophe. They've observed that the alleged risks of fracking -- such as groundwater contamination -- haven't happened as shale drilling boomed in nearby Pennsylvania. 
The larger irony is that, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Mr. Cuomo is now talking up the risks of climate change. Big-city greens are urging him to spend tens of billions of dollars on levees and other barriers as protection against rising seas. But if the Governor really believes carbon emissions are a major threat, the biggest contribution Mr. Cuomo could make would be to allow fracking. 
The more U.S. power plants burn natural gas instead of coal, the less particulate pollution and carbon dioxide are put into the atmosphere. Burning coal puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide per raw unit of energy generated. This is simple chemistry based on the hydrogen-carbon ratio of the two energy sources. Add in better turbine technology at newer natural-gas power plants and the efficiency gain is even greater, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Last year the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a remarkable fact: Overall U.S. carbon dioxide emissions -- the majority of which come from electricity generation -- had fallen to their lowest level in 20 years, some 14% off the peak in 2007. There are upwards of 50 million more energy consumers in the U.S. than there were 20 years ago, so the achievement is all the more impressive. 
This didn't happen with command-and-control regulation. Nor have the European countries who signed up to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change made such progress. Their strategy of channeling taxpayer subsidies to wind and solar power has achieved about half the per-capita carbon emissions reduction. U.S. emissions are lower because utilities have responded to the market incentive of cheaper natural gas. 
Mr. Cuomo is surely aware of all this. For now the Governor's political read looks to be that New York's upstate economy can sit hostage to the antigrowth energy agenda of wealthy downstate environmentalists.

Regarding your Dec. 26 editorial "The Winds of Washington" and the companion op-ed by Phil Gramm "The Multiple Distortions of Wind Subsidies": 
I have been trying to figure out what principle underlies your opposition to encouraging the development of clean, renewable energy sources that create American jobs and could help us avoid the planetary calamity of global warming. 
Are you really worried about budget deficits? While railing against modest incentives for wind energy, you say nothing of the more than $113 billion in federal subsidies that will go to fossil-fuel industries over the next 10 years alone. These subsidies benefit some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet, including the five largest oil corporations, which made a combined profit of $1 trillion over the last decade. 
Do you really think there should be a 20-year cutoff for support for "mature" industries? If that's your yardstick, I look forward to your support for my bill to end subsidies for the century-old fossil-fuel industry. While you're at it, how about taking on the massive corporate welfare over the past 65 years for the nuclear-power industry, which has received more than $95 billion (in 2011 dollars) in federal research and development support? 
Do you really believe in closing tax loopholes? Please. I missed your outrage over Exxon-Mobil, one of the most profitable corporations in history, paying no federal income taxes in 2009 and in fact receiving a rebate from the IRS. 
Is Sen. Gramm really concerned about "preferential treatment by the Bureau of Land Management?" If so, he might have dripped a little of his disdain in the direction of coal companies and their single-bid, sweetheart leases to mine on federal lands without paying fair value in royalties to the U.S. 
Here's the bottom line: Scientists now foresee the earth warming by 8 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of this century. That would be catastrophic. It's already past time to get serious about the threat of global warming. One important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is by supporting wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other sustainable energy sources. 
Sen. Bernard Sanders (I., Vt.) 
Washington 
Phil Gramm rightly calls on Uncle Sam to stop subsidizing the wind-power industry. Like all subsidies, these distort markets and make the country poorer -- all in order to enrich a handful of politically influential businesses by shielding them from the realities of the marketplace. 
The late Jean-Francois Revel's characterization of the demands of African plutocrats for foreign aid from rich-country governments applies perfectly to the demands of private CEOs for domestic aid from rich-country governments: "Give us development in the form of subsidies, so as to spare us the effort of establishing an efficient relationship with reality." 
Donald J. Boudreaux 
Professor of Economics 
George Mason University 
Fairfax, Va. 
In addition to Mr. Gramm's scathing report and various contributors' letters concerning the economics and practicality of wind power, I also note that the Renewable Energy Foundation in the U.K. released a study on Dec. 19 that demonstrated that "the economic life of onshore wind turbines is between 10 and 15 years, not the 20 to 25 years projected by the wind industry itself." This is yet another indication of the futility of the subsidies we have lavished on the wind industry and another example of throwing our tax money away for a feel-good project that returns nothing in the way of a "greener" or more beneficial energy source, to say nothing of the cost. 
James R. Brown 
Omaha, Neb. 
Phil Gramm is right to a point: Subsidies for wind power should end. However, there remains the greater point about those subsidies -- how they in fact contribute to the loss of America the Beautiful, including the best of our public lands. Where I live in the Pacific Northwest, it is downright heartbreaking to see what has happened to the Columbia River Gorge in the name of wind power. Certainly, Lewis and Clark would no longer recognize the place. 
Before environmentalists learned to become apologists for wind and solar power, they were the first to worry about the beauty of America's landscape. Such epic destruction is unacceptable for any form of energy. In the matter of proper, sustainable growth, the landscape should be our first consideration. Until wind and solar can assure us of that, they resolve little of the still larger problem of living within our means.

Abstract 
Drilling for oil off the Antarctic coast would mean contending with hurricane-strength winds and the world's largest icebergs -- bergs not just bigger than the one that sank the Titanic, and not just bigger than the Titanic itself, but bigger than the city that built the Titanic. [...]that's not to mention the vast expense of getting all your people and equipment to the center of the continent, or ensuring their survival in temperatures so cold that you can cut diesel fuel with a chain saw. 

Full Text 
Over Christmas, a British scientific team had to give up its mission to drill beneath an ancient Antarctic lake, searching for minute forms of life. The researchers were done in by equipment failures and lack of fuel. 
When it comes to human existence on the frozen continent, everything always hangs by a thread. A hundred years ago, what was then the world's most famous race had just run its murderous course in Antarctica. Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole, had returned to civilization and was giving lectures about his triumph. The frozen body of Amundsen's beaten rival, Captain Robert Scott, had just been discovered by his disconsolate friends, who reburied him in the ice that had broken his heart. 
Over the past century, our perception of Antarctica has changed dramatically. The early heroic explorers saw it as a place of danger, to be feared and perhaps conquered. We have learned to view it as a fragile place, pristine but endangered. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is warming at an unprecedented rate, according to recent reports, and large parts of this so-called weak underbelly of the continent could be in danger of melting. 
But neither view captures the whole truth about the freezer at the bottom of the world. In my five visits to different parts of the continent, I have seen many different faces of the ice, but it has rarely seemed hostile and never, ever vulnerable. Antarctica is about as tough as continents get. 
Think of the way it has managed to stay aloof from us for almost all of human history. Though humans emerged from Africa some 60,000 years ago and explored (and exploited) every other scrap of land on Earth, Antarctica has stayed hidden behind an all-but-impenetrable wall of ice. Though it is the size of the continental U.S., we didn't even know it existed until a scant few centuries ago. And when you go there and see the wooden huts (and somber crosses) that the heroic explorers left behind, you are immediately struck by how new they all look. This is the only continent on Earth whose history of human exploration is recent enough to touch. 
Even today, with all our technology and capabilities, Antarctica always has the last word. On my visits there people told me again and again: "It makes you feel small." In the summer, when the weather turns bad, all you can do is sit tight and wait it out. And in the winter, you are more isolated than if you were in outer space. If something goes wrong on the International Space Station, it will take a matter of days or weeks to rescue everyone on board. But if there's a problem at South Pole Station in winter, the residents will have to wait months for rescue. 
True, the Antarctic Treaty, signed by the 49 countries that operate bases there, protects the continent by banning its military use and the exploitation of its minerals or other resources. But (unlike the warmer and much more accessible Arctic) you'd have to be pretty desperate for oil or coal before you'd take your chances in Antarctica, even without the treaty. Drilling for oil off the Antarctic coast would mean contending with hurricane-strength winds and the world's largest icebergs -- bergs not just bigger than the one that sank the Titanic, and not just bigger than the Titanic itself, but bigger than the city that built the Titanic. 
To drill on the land there, you would first have to contend with the mantle of ice that blankets 99% of the continent and can be more than 2 miles thick. If you decided to drill through to the rock itself, you'd have to figure out how to keep your drill head from getting sheared off; the ice slides by at more than 30 feet a year. And that's not to mention the vast expense of getting all your people and equipment to the center of the continent, or ensuring their survival in temperatures so cold that you can cut diesel fuel with a chain saw. 
The Treaty sets plenty of rules for how not to pollute the ice or leave behind detritus that will spoil the landscape. If humans polluted the coast, the local wildlife would indeed suffer. But there are no living things in the interior to care. Anything left on the giant ice sheets by humans is eventually buried, stretched, squeezed, twisted, carried to the coast and spat out as an iceberg. That includes Captain Scott and his companions. By now, their frozen bodies will have stretched to some 10 feet or more, and their ultimate fate is to break off and sail out to sea before eventually melting and sinking into the mud at the bottom of some distant ocean. Antarctica has its own long-term way of expunging human unpleasantness from its vicinity. 
Still, there is substantial evidence that human activity is changing Antarctica. Though today's scientists and tourist operations are commendably scrupulous about keeping the environment pristine, they can't protect it from the warming that comes via the ocean and the air. As our planet warms, the ice has been one of the first responders. In the past few decades, giant floating ice shelves have shattered, and glaciers have begun accelerating toward the coast at what is -- for ice -- breakneck speed. Warmer ocean waters are also lapping at the ice's underside, eating away at its coastal buttresses. 
And the ocean is bringing unwelcome visitors, too. Isolated from the rest of the world by the sheer force of its cold, Antarctica has excluded bone-crushing sea creatures like crabs and lobster for some 30 million years. This has allowed its sea life to grow big and beautiful, with 20-legged starfish and sea spiders the size of dinner plates. But a colony of king crabs has floated down from the north, using warmer waves as stepping stones. They are now sitting off the Antarctic coast, more than a million of them, waiting for the last wave that will carry them to the feast of a lifetime. 
All of this is obviously bad news for many of the continent's animals (though it will probably be good news for others, as nature finds its own inventive ways of turning a crisis into a triumph). But is it bad news for Antarctica? After all, the continent has been warm before. A hundred million years ago, it was covered with forests and had dinosaurs roaming its surface. Hot or cold, I don't think the continent really cares. 
None of this is to say that we should just sit back and relax, because there's a nasty sting in this tale. Antarctica -- and the Arctic too -- have provided us with incontrovertible proof that our world is warming: We are the ones who should worry. If the melting Antarctic ice floods the subways of New York and London and Shanghai, the continent itself will stay high and dry. We'll be the ones in trouble. The lesson from Antarctica should not be about protecting a frozen continent but about learning how to protect ourselves.

U.S. News: Top Environmental Regulator to Step Down

Abstract 
Industry lobbyists and environmentalists said other candidates include Mary D. Nichols, the chairman of California's Air Resources Board in charge of implementing the state's climate-change regulations, and Kathleen McGinty, who headed the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Clinton administration and also led Pennsylvania's environmental department. 

Full Text 
Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson said Thursday she will leave her post in early 2013, ending almost four years in which she was lauded by environmentalists for pursuing the first U.S. greenhouse-gas regulations while battling Republican efforts to limit her agency's powers. 
Appointing Ms. Jackson's successor is among the most important personnel moves for President Barack Obama in his second term because the top environmental regulator has broad executive powers in an era of legislative gridlock. 
The next EPA leader is likely to write and enforce regulations affecting power plants, factories, and oil and natural-gas drilling rigs across the country. The EPA could look at regulating hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and is already moving ahead with limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. 
Under Ms. Jackson, the EPA adopted vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, new limits on toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial boilers, and stricter national standards for soot. 
During Mr. Obama's first four years, EPA rules became a symbol for what Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, called the president's antibusiness regulatory overreach. 
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Ms. Jackson "has been a steadfast advocate for clean air, clean water, a stable climate and public health -- often in the face of very vocal and forceful detractors." 
With his nomination, Mr. Obama will send a message on his environmental plans for a second term. Two potential choices are Bob Perciasepe, the deputy EPA administrator who will take over as acting administrator when Ms. Jackson leaves, and Gina McCarthy, the EPA assistant administrator in charge of air-quality programs. While any nominee could face a Senate confirmation fight, both of those officials have negotiated with industry on major regulations and are viewed as less-polarizing figures than Ms. Jackson, industry lobbyists said. 
To implement recent rules, "the next EPA leader will need a good working knowledge of the agency," said Scott Segal, a partner at law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, who has lobbied against coal-plant regulations. "To me, this counsels in favor of an inside choice." 
Industry lobbyists and environmentalists said other candidates include Mary D. Nichols, the chairman of California's Air Resources Board in charge of implementing the state's climate-change regulations, and Kathleen McGinty, who headed the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Clinton administration and also led Pennsylvania's environmental department. 
Ms. Nichols would be welcomed by environmentalists but could face opposition from Republicans opposed to climate-change regulations. Ms. McGinty, a former aide to former Vice President Al Gore, also served in 2011 on an Energy Department subcommittee that endorsed natural gas as "a cornerstone of the U.S. economy." 
A White House spokesman declined to discuss potential nominees. 
Ms. Jackson, 50, has served in her role since early in Mr. Obama's first term. She said in a statement Thursday that she was "confident the ship is sailing in the right direction, and ready in my own life for new challenges." 
Ms. Jackson said the agency has made "historic progress" on cleaning up pollution and protecting public health. She said she will depart after Mr. Obama's next State of the Union address. 
The president on Thursday thanked Ms. Jackson and said, "under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink." 
Ms. Jackson made a formal finding in 2009 that greenhouse-gas emissions posed a danger to public health and successfully defended the finding in federal appeals court this past June. This gives the agency the authority to impose limits on such emissions. 
Republicans and industry groups often criticized Ms. Jackson, saying her agency's regulations were killing jobs and raising uncertainty for business. 
Ross Eisenberg, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said this month Ms. Jackson's EPA "seems wedded to the notion that it must push its policies as hard as it possibly can, with the goal being to enact the strictest possible standard that will survive legal scrutiny." 
GOP congressional opposition toppled the most ambitious environmental effort of Mr. Obama's first term, a bill to cap greenhouse-gas emissions and set up an emissions-trading system. 
In February 2011, Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers, gave Ms. Jackson a pair of boxing gloves for her birthday, citing her many tussles with lawmakers. 
Mixed Results 
Major Accomplishments: 
-- Rules requiring reduction in mercury, acid gases and soot emissions from coal-fired power plants were set in 2011. Similar standards for industrial boilers were set this 

month. 
-- Rules were set in April to limit the release of smog-forming chemicals from hydraulic fracturing. 
What She Didn't Accomplish: 
-- Congress didn't pass laws to cap greenhouse-gas emissions. 
-- President Obama rejected her recommendation to tighten the national smog-pollution standard.

Abstract 
Lisa Jackson of the Environmental Protection Agency, who announced Thursday she is resigning -- must include the millions of Americans who can't find a job or haven't seen their incomes rise. 

Full Text 
More than four years after the 2008 panic, the U.S. economy still hasn't rebounded to its normal potential growth trend. So the legacy of one of the main culprits -- Lisa Jackson of the Environmental Protection Agency, who announced Thursday she is resigning -- must include the millions of Americans who can't find a job or haven't seen their incomes rise. 
The EPA chief is among President Obama's most abusive and reckless regulators -- his repressed green id. Over her four years, Ms. Jackson inflicted an unprecedented surge of new rules on private business, including the most expensive ever in the history of government by several orders of magnitude. A "major" regulation used to be defined as imposing costs of $100 million or more. The EPA now routinely issues multibillion-dollar rules with little more than a press release. 
Ms. Jackson most notably cranked up clean-air regulation that will force a third or even as much as half of the U.S. coal-fired electric fleet out of existence. She also rewrote laws to declare carbon emissions a "dangerous pollutant" even though the laws were written in the 1970s. Along with other rules, including auto efficiency standards, she started a re-engineering of the U.S. energy system, without so much as a Congressional vote. 
Ms. Jackson used her discretion to make these rules as aggressive and punitive as possible, even if they couldn't survive legal scrutiny. To the extent this surge contributed to business uncertainty and stole dollars otherwise available for private investment, Ms. Jackson's agenda explains why the economic recovery and job creation are weaker than they ought to be by historical standards. Take the champagne off ice. 
Nothing like this was expected out of Ms. Jackson, a New Jersey political functionary under then-Governor Jon Corzine. She turned out to be a master power-politics operator. Her most consequential victory was steamrolling Cass Sunstein at the White House regulatory review office. 
Mr. Sunstein was a promoter of sensible regulation only when the benefits justified the costs, and he often opposed Ms. Jackson's methods internally. When he succeeded in persuading the President to yank a purely discretionary EPA rule on ozone in 2011, Ms. Jackson went around town threatening to resign and make trouble for Mr. Obama among his environmental base. 
Her authority was never challenged seriously again. The EPA now routinely rigs its estimates to exaggerate benefits -- which all of a sudden include such shapeless concepts as racial justice and economic redistribution -- and underestimate costs, when it admits costs exist at all. 
Astonishingly enough, the green lobby regards Ms. Jackson's term as something of a disappointment, because she didn't do enough on the supposedly humanity-defining problem of global warming and compromised too often. We'd hate to see who they think should continue the revolution she started.

Abstract 
Mr. Ridley's claim that recent findings support a climate sensitivity (the global climate response to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide) of 1.6 degrees-1.7 degrees C (2.9 degrees-3.1 degrees F) does not stand up to the weight of evidence showing higher values, including the most recent and comprehensive study of this question, published just three weeks ago in the top journal Nature.

"Cooling Down the Fears of Climate Change" by Matt Ridley (op-ed, Dec. 19) is another misleading attempt to present a distorted view of the consensus that exists among the vast majority of the community of climate experts. Mr. Ridley's claim that recent findings support a climate sensitivity (the global climate response to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide) of 1.6 degrees-1.7 degrees C (2.9 degrees-3.1 degrees F) does not stand up to the weight of evidence showing higher values, including the most recent and comprehensive study of this question, published just three weeks ago in the top journal Nature. An international team of 36 scientists (including U.S. 
scientists from Harvard and NASA) reports that a thorough examination of evidence based on the actual history of earth's climate supports a "warming of 2.2-4.8K (equal to 2.2 degrees-4.8 degrees C or 4.0 degrees-8.6 degrees F) per doubling of atmospheric CO2, which agrees with IPCC estimates." Interestingly, this study is based on a large body of evidence that is independent of the climate models that skeptics are so fond of criticizing.

We should waste little time and energy worrying about possibility of humans having a significant effect on our climate. But if we want something to worry about, consider what our government officials plan to do about this imagined problem. They insist that we quickly wean ourselves from the use of carbon containing fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that emit CO2, that dangerous "greenhouse gas" that causes global warming. These fuels have proven to be efficient and environmentally acceptable for many years, but must now be supplanted by costly, subsidized, inefficient, intermittent and distantly located non-carbon methods such as windmills and solar panels. Furthermore, serious thought is being given to control CO2 emission selectively from exhaust gases from coal fired power plants, a concept from far left field. Mr. Ridley makes a strong case, based on unbiased science, showing that this benign and necessary-for-life component of our atmosphere is really not capable of producing significant climate change. So, what to do? 
First, let's cleanse our minds of the bias of the climate alarmists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and then start to understand how our climate really works. A host of natural forces have produced wild variability over the centuries. The current fad of ascribing local, severe weather events to imagined climate change such as global warming is largely a waste of time.

Mr. Ridley correctly notes that carbon dioxide is not the only "greenhouse gas" that can affect climate and that water vapor is also a key factor. He explains that "a little warming (from whatever cause)" heats the oceans and makes the atmosphere more humid and that such humidity including cloud formations affects climate. 
Global warming alarmists have put the cart before the horse. Higher levels of the trace gas, carbon dioxide, are a byproduct, not a cause, of global warming brought about by infinitely more powerful cosmic forces. It is a travesty to blame humankind for global warming and to deny us the power of fossil fuels, which will be essential to protect, feed and relocate large populations should natural forces beyond our control continue to raise sea levels.

Mr. Ridley is wrong about future global warming. In our paper "A Fair Plan to Safeguard Earth's Climate," we show that by the middle of this century the warming will exceed the 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) maximum allowed by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." 
In that paper and its sequel, "A Revised Fair Plan to Safeguard Earth's Climate," we phase out the emission of greenhouse gases this century such that the cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions by the developing and developed countries are equal. Both plans keep global warming below the UNFCCC allowable maximum of 2 degrees C.

Abstract 
Comparing the trend in global temperature over the past 100-150 years with the change in "radiative forcing" (heating or cooling power) from carbon dioxide, aerosols and other sources, minus ocean heat uptake, can now give a good estimate of climate sensitivity. 

Full Text 
Forget the Doha climate jamboree that ended earlier this month. The theological discussions in Qatar of the arcana of climate treaties are irrelevant. By far the most important debate about climate change is taking place among scientists, on the issue of climate sensitivity: How much warming will a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide actually produce? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has to pronounce its answer to this question in its Fifth Assessment Report next year. 
The general public is not privy to the IPCC debate. But I have been speaking to somebody who understands the issues: Nic Lewis. A semiretired successful financier from Bath, England, with a strong mathematics and physics background, Mr. Lewis has made significant contributions to the subject of climate change. 
He first collaborated with others to expose major statistical errors in a 2009 study of Antarctic temperatures. In 2011 he discovered that the IPCC had, by an unjustified statistical manipulation, altered the results of a key 2006 paper by Piers Forster of Reading University and Jonathan Gregory of the Met Office (the United Kingdom's national weather service), to vastly increase the small risk that the paper showed of climate sensitivity being high. Mr. Lewis also found that the IPCC had misreported the results of another study, leading to the IPCC issuing an Erratum in 2011. 
Mr. Lewis tells me that the latest observational estimates of the effect of aerosols (such as sulfurous particles from coal smoke) find that they have much less cooling effect than thought when the last IPCC report was written. The rate at which the ocean is absorbing greenhouse-gas-induced warming is also now known to be fairly modest. In other words, the two excuses used to explain away the slow, mild warming we have actually experienced -- culminating in a standstill in which global temperatures are no higher than they were 16 years ago -- no longer work. 
In short: We can now estimate, based on observations, how sensitive the temperature is to carbon dioxide. We do not need to rely heavily on unproven models. Comparing the trend in global temperature over the past 100-150 years with the change in "radiative forcing" (heating or cooling power) from carbon dioxide, aerosols and other sources, minus ocean heat uptake, can now give a good estimate of climate sensitivity. 
The conclusion -- taking the best observational estimates of the change in decadal-average global temperature between 1871-80 and 2002-11, and of the corresponding changes in forcing and ocean heat uptake -- is this: A doubling of CO2 will lead to a warming of 1.6 degrees-1.7 degrees C (2.9 degrees-3.1 degrees F). 
This is much lower than the IPCC's current best estimate, 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F). 
Mr. Lewis is an expert reviewer of the recently leaked draft of the IPCC's WG1 Scientific Report. The IPCC forbids him to quote from it, but he is privy to all the observational best estimates and uncertainty ranges the draft report gives. What he has told me is dynamite. 
Given what we know now, there is almost no way that the feared large temperature rise is going to happen. Mr. Lewis comments: "Taking the IPCC scenario that assumes a doubling of CO2, plus the equivalent of another 30% rise from other greenhouse gases by 2100, we are likely to experience a further rise of no more than 1 degreesC." 
A cumulative change of less than 2 degreesC by the end of this century will do no net harm. It will actually do net good -- that much the IPCC scientists have already agreed upon in the last IPCC report. Rainfall will increase slightly, growing seasons will lengthen, Greenland's ice cap will melt only very slowly, and so on. 
Some of the best recent observationally based research also points to climate sensitivity being about 1.6 degreesC for a doubling of CO2. An impressive study published this year by Magne Aldrin of the Norwegian Computing Center and colleagues gives a most-likely estimate of 1.6 degreesC. Michael Ring and Michael Schlesinger of the University of Illinois, using the most trustworthy temperature record, also estimate 1.6 degreesC. 
The big question is this: Will the lead authors of the relevant chapter of the forthcoming IPCC scientific report acknowledge that the best observational evidence no longer supports the IPCC's existing 2 degrees-4.5 degreesC "likely" range for climate sensitivity? Unfortunately, this seems unlikely -- given the organization's record of replacing evidence-based policy-making with policy-based evidence-making, as well as the reluctance of academic scientists to accept that what they have been maintaining for many years is wrong. 
How can there be such disagreement about climate sensitivity if the greenhouse properties of CO2 are well established? Most people assume that the theory of dangerous global warming is built entirely on carbon dioxide. It is not. 
There is little dispute among scientists about how much warming CO2 alone can produce, all other things being equal: about 1.1 degrees-1.2 degreesC for a doubling from preindustrial levels. The way warming from CO2 becomes really dangerous is through amplification by positive feedbacks -- principally from water vapor and the clouds this vapor produces. 
It goes like this: A little warming (from whatever cause) heats up the sea, which makes the air more humid -- and water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas. The resulting model-simulated changes in clouds generally increase warming further, so the warming is doubled, trebled or more. 
That assumption lies at the heart of every model used by the IPCC, but not even the most zealous climate scientist would claim that this trebling is an established fact. For a start, water vapor may not be increasing. A recent paper from Colorado State University concluded that "we can neither prove nor disprove a robust trend in the global water vapor data." And then, as one Nobel Prize-winning physicist with a senior role in combating climate change admitted to me the other day: "We don't even know the sign" of water vapor's effect -- in other words, whether it speeds up or slows down a warming of the atmosphere. 
Climate models are known to poorly simulate clouds, and given clouds' very strong effect on the climate system -- some types cooling the Earth either by shading it or by transporting heat up and cold down in thunderstorms, and others warming the Earth by blocking outgoing radiation -- it remains highly plausible that there is no net positive feedback from water vapor. 
If this is indeed the case, then we would have seen about 0.6 degreesC of warming so far, and our observational data would be pointing at about 1.2 degreesC of warming for the end of the century. And this is, to repeat, roughly where we are. 
The scientists at the IPCC next year have to choose whether they will admit -- contrary to what complex, unverifiable computer models indicate -- that the observational evidence now points toward lukewarm temperature change with no net harm. On behalf of all those poor people whose lives are being ruined by high food and energy prices caused by the diversion of corn to biofuel and the subsidizing of renewable energy driven by carboncrats and their crony-capitalist friends, one can only hope the scientists will do so.

Abstract 
The IEA, an authoritative source of information on global oil markets, is joining other forecasters such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S. Energy Information Administration in predicting the sharp rise in U.S. oil production in the coming years. 

Full text 
A shale-oil boom will help the U.S. overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer by 2020, according to the International Energy Agency, a shift that could transform not just energy supplies but also U.S. politics and diplomacy. 
The Paris-based agency, which advises industrialized nations on their energy policies, said the global energy map "is being redrawn by the resurgence in oil and gas production in the United States." 
The assessment -- a stark contrast from last year, when Russia and Saudi Arabia were seen vying for the top position -- comes a week after the end of a presidential campaign in which energy was a prime topic, and it shows how different President Barack Obama's second term will be from his first on energy policy. 
Four years ago, the perception of energy scarcity and rising concern about global warming led Mr. Obama to push for legislation capping greenhouse-gas emissions and to pump billions of federal dollars into green-energy companies. Both policies caused grief for the president, as the greenhouse-gas bill died in the Senate and Republicans attacked him over the bankruptcy of solar-panel maker Solyndra LLC. 
In Mr. Obama's second term, Republican control of the House makes any big climate-change legislation unlikely, and budget deficits will limit any effort to spend billions more on green-energy projects. 
But the surge in U.S. oil production, to a projected 11.1 million barrels a day in 2020, has given the White House a chance to make peace with Republicans and energy executives, at least on some fronts. Like Republicans, Mr. Obama has said that growing energy extraction in the U.S. can create jobs and boost the economy. Also, the rising use of natural gas in place of coal to generate electricity helps reduce carbon-dioxide emissions without legislation. 
The IEA, an authoritative source of information on global oil markets, is joining other forecasters such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S. Energy Information Administration in predicting the sharp rise in U.S. oil production in the coming years. 
The IEA also said natural gas will displace oil as the largest single fuel in the U.S. energy mix by 2030. U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions from energy consumption were down 5.3% in the first seven months of 2012, compared to a year earlier, according to U.S. figures. That came as natural gas accounted for 31% of U.S. electricity generation in the first eight months of this year, up from 24% a year earlier. 
"The entire energy policy of the U.S. has been about scarcity, derived from the 1970s supply shocks," said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners LLC. "Now, we have a different reality -- the age of energy adequacy." 
Higher U.S. oil production doesn't necessarily mean lower prices at the gasoline pump, because oil prices are set on the global market, and U.S. oil is expensive to extract. Next-month oil futures traded around $85.62 a barrel late Monday, down from nearly $100 a barrel in September. U.S. and Iraqi production have helped keep a lid on prices, but a bigger factor may be Europe's economic woes and weaker global demand. 
U.S. oil consumption last year also dropped to 18.9 million barrels a day, down 8.4% from 2006, and the IEA projected continued declines in coming decades. 
For U.S. businesses, the energy shifts bring opportunities. The glut of inexpensive natural gas from widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has driven down energy costs for industrial consumers, helping large manufacturers, as well as the fertilizer and chemical firms. 
But the changes can take industry players off guard. Some U.S. refiners spent billions upgrading their refineries to process heavier crude oil found outside the U.S. in places such as Venezuela's Orinoco belt or in Canada's tar sands. If the IEA's predictions come true, the U.S. could soon be awash in easier-to-process domestic crude oil -- with no way to get rid of the excess supply, because U.S. law generally bans crude-oil exports. That would force new investment in refining capacity for lighter, sweeter grades of oil. 
The made-in-USA oil is already displacing imports of similar crude from West Africa, and the market for it could be saturated as early as 2013, said analysts with Raymond James. "The question is: will federal regulators allow these exports to materialize?" the analysts asked in a research note, adding that allowing exports could be politically tricky. The crude export ban was designed to ensure U.S. energy security following the Arab oil embargo in 1973. 
Within a decade, the IEA forecasts U.S. oil imports will fall by more than half, to just four million barrels a day from 10 million barrels a day currently. It credited tougher gas-mileage standards for cars, mandated in Mr. Obama's first term, in addition to the higher domestic oil output. 
The IEA suggested that newly found U.S. energy independence could redefine military commitments. OPEC will continue to be the powerhouse of global production, the agency said, but a growing portion of its output will go to nations like China and India instead of North America. 
"It accelerates the switch in direction of international oil trade toward Asia, putting a focus on the security of the strategic routes that bring Middle East oil to Asian markets," it said. 
China already receives half of its oil imports from the Persian Gulf, while the U.S. receives less than 20% of its imports from the region. U.S. military protection of Middle East sea lanes has for decades been a core mission of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, at an estimated cost of between $60 billion and $80 billion a year. Given the high U.S. budget deficit, looming defense cuts and what many perceive as an overstretched Navy, that mission could come into question. 
The recent increase in U.S. drilling has led to a backlash that is strong among people who supported Mr. Obama. Environmental groups have expressed concern about the risk to groundwater from fracking, a technology that uses pressurized water to break open rocks to access more oil and natural gas. 
The intensive use of water "will increasingly impose additional costs" and could "threaten the viability of projects" for shale oil and gas, the IEA said. 
Delighting environmental activists, Mr. Obama blocked the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada through the central U.S., expressing concern about risks to an aquifer in Nebraska along the pipeline's route. Republicans and the energy industry claimed the decision was evidence the administration was hostile to traditional energy sources. 
Mr. Obama must also decide how quickly he wants to push the transition to natural gas from coal for generating electricity.

Abstract 
Natural gas has the huge added advantage of causing far less local air pollution -- the kind that, unlike carbon dioxide, is harmful to human health. 

Full Text 
You may think that global warming is the biggest scam of all time, driven by politicians who want to scare you and scientists who love media attention and increased funding. Or you may think global warming is the greatest threat we face, and that if we don't act immediately we'll leave a tragic legacy for our children and grandchildren. 
One of us is a former skeptic, converted by his own research to the conviction that man-made carbon dioxide is the decisive factor in a real phenomenon of climate change. The other is agnostic, willing to be persuaded of human causality but rejecting as ineffective or counterproductive the anti-growth policies proposed by some alarmists. People like us -- and all those struggling with the ambiguities of this highly uncertain topic -- might come together around policies that make sense whatever the scientific facts ultimately prove to be. 
For the sake of argument, let's begin by assuming that the United Nations evaluation is correct in arguing that global warming is real, caused by humans, and going to cause severe disruption to our economies and to our lives. Please bear with us even if you reject this claim; we'll suggest actions that make sense regardless of your position. 
China's yearly greenhouse-gas emissions first exceeded those of the United States in 2006, and by the end of this year the Chinese will be emitting twice as much as the Americans. This spectacular rise matches China's economic growth and vast expansion of coal use. For the last seven years, China has been adding more than a gigawatt of new coal power each week, or more than 52 new gigawatts of additional capacity every year. (For comparison, New York City uses 10 gigawatts and isn't increasing its use.) And we can expect Chinese economic and energy growth to continue. 
In the U.S., by contrast, emissions are at the lowest they've been for 20 years thanks largely to America's continuing switch from coal to natural gas, which emits half as much carbon dioxide for each kilowatt hour of energy generated. 
This means that the future warming projected by the U.N. comes not from the U.S. (or from other developed countries) but primarily from China, India and the rest of the rapidly developing world. 
Assuming that the U.N. scenario is correct, the only hope for controlling China's emissions is to reduce its coal growth -- a challenge since coal is cheap, China has a great natural supply, and the Chinese currently derive nearly 70% of their electricity from coal. 
We suggest a dual approach: profitable conservation and rapid expansion of the natural-gas economy. 
The conservation we suggest is technological, meaning it wouldn't depend on individual sacrifice or cultural change. Done right, this conservation can yield large returns on investment. 
Install better insulation, for example, and you can save on both heating and cooling. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that close to half of American consumers could get back 100% of their investment over roughly five years. Utility commissions could link the revenue of utilities to their successful implementation of efficiency, as they have done with success in our home states, Indiana and California. 
Other ways to achieve profitable conservation include investing in "cool roofs" that reflect heat radiation. These can be cheaper and more efficient than installing solar cell collectors to generate power used by appliances such as air conditioners. 
Even more promising is the switch away from coal to natural gas, particularly in the developing world. Natural gas has the huge added advantage of causing far less local air pollution -- the kind that, unlike carbon dioxide, is harmful to human health. Coal releases far higher levels of soot and other chemicals that are currently choking China. 
One of the factors slowing the world-wide switch to natural gas, however, is shortsighted opposition from some environmentalists in the U.S., Europe and beyond. They argue that extracting natural gas by hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") may pollute local water supplies and leak the powerful greenhouse gas methane, and their arguments affect official and commercial thinking in both the developed and developing worlds. 
It is true that fracking has caused some limited, local pollution in the U.S., but this is attributable largely to the wildcatting behavior of the rapidly growing industry. Technology for clean fracking is technically straightforward, and government authorities can promote its use through careful monitoring and large fines for transgressions. 
Some environmentalists argue that the best approach to limiting greenhouse-gas emissions is to switch to "renewables." But these energy sources are still far outside the budgets of the developing nations. China last year installed two gigawatts of solar capacity -- but that is "peak" power representing only a clear midday when the sun is directly overhead. Average in nights and cloudy days, and the average power these plants can deliver is about 1/4 gigawatt. Meanwhile, China's coal use grows at about 50 gigawatts per year, or 200 times faster than its solar growth. No realistic scenario foresees renewables making more than a marginal contribution in the developing world for many decades. 
The dual solution of profitable conservation (beloved by liberals) and clean fracking (touted by conservatives) may not fully satisfy either side. But we hope it can provide a middle ground on which political factions can come together. 
It is still conceivable that global warming isn't caused by greenhouse gases, that the theory and the computer models are wrong, and that the match between the temperature curve and carbon-dioxide emissions is accidental. Even so, profitable conservation makes business sense, and a natural-gas economy would reduce smog and improve public health. It is worth facilitating China's shift from coal to natural gas for humanitarian reasons alone.

Full Text 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg is endorsing President Barack Obama for re-election, citing his positions on climate change, abortion and marriage equality as major factors in his 
decision. 
In an op-ed column published Thursday in Bloomberg View, the mayor wrote that the damage caused by Sandy brought the "stakes of Tuesday's presidential election into sharp 
relief." 

"One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not," wrote the mayor, referring to Mr. Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. 

"I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics." 
Mr. Bloomberg was a lifelong Democrat who became a Republican before his first run for City Hall in 2001. In 2007, he left the Republican Party as he flirted with a presidential 
bid, and he has remained unaffiliated ever since. 

In his column, Mr. Bloomberg praised the president's record on climate change. 

"We need leadership from the White House -- and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting 
higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks," he wrote. 
Mr. Obama's administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants, which are estimated to kill 13,000 

Americans a year, the mayor wrote. The mayor said Mr. Romney also has a history of tackling climate change, citing his record as governor of Massachusetts. 

"But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported," he wrote. "This issue is too important. We need determined 
leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward." 
The mayor described Mr. Romney as a "good and decent man" who would bring "valuable business experience" to the Oval Office. 
In 2004, the mayor supported President George W. Bush for re-election. He refused in 2008 to say publicly who he was backing.

Abstract 
Analysts say the acquisition will help Hitachi bolster its nuclear-power business, which has lost momentum since the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in March 2011, and to globalize its operations by finding new growth opportunities in markets such as the U.K. Tatsuro Ishizuka, Hitachi vice president and executive officer, didn't provide details about the cost of building the plants envisioned as part of the Horizon project. 

Full Text 
TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. said Tuesday it will buy British nuclear venture Horizon from Germany's RWE AG and E. ON AG, extending a drive into potentially lucrative infrastructure 
businesses while cutting exposure to low-margin consumer-electronics operations. 
The Horizon acquisition, priced at GBP 696 million ($1.12 billion), comes as the Japanese industrial-electronics giant aims to more than double revenue from its nuclear-power 
business within 10 years. The Horizon program involves the planned construction of four to six new nuclear plants a two U.K. sites. 

Hitachi's nuclear business still makes up only a tiny portion -- less than 2% -- of its revenue. But the company has been reshaping itself in an expensive restructuring process that means backing away from consumer electronics, an area where many of its Japanese peers are struggling, to focus on global infrastructure projects such as building power plants and rail lines. 
Analysts say the acquisition will help Hitachi bolster its nuclear-power business, which has lost momentum since the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in March 2011, and to globalize its operations by finding new growth opportunities in markets such as the U.K. 
Tatsuro Ishizuka, Hitachi vice president and executive officer, didn't provide details about the cost of building the plants envisioned as part of the Horizon project. 
At a news conference in London, he said the U.K. government hasn't set the guaranteed price for electricity to be produced at the plants, but Hitachi hopes "the price will 
decided at a fair level." 

The deal is vital for the U.K. government, which has placed nuclear power at the core of its energy policy as it plans new power generators to replace old coal- and nuclear-

power stations. 
Responding to questions about whether a Japanese company was an appropriate buyer following the nuclear-plant disaster there, Edward Davey, the U.K.'s secretary of state for 
energy and climate change, said he is "extremely happy" that a Japanese company bought Horizon. 

The proposed reactor design is more advanced than at Fukushima, he said. 
Hitachi led a consortium with Canada's SNC-Lavalin in securing Horizon, beating a rival bid by Westinghouse Electric Co., a unit of Toshiba Corp. 
In a statement, Hitachi President Hiroaki Nakanishi described the deal as the start of "a 100-year commitment to the U.K."

EDUCATION 
Test That Student 
Critics have objected in recent years to the public schools' increasing emphasis on high-stakes testing. But several recent scholarly articles bolster the case that testing can help 

students to achieve. 
Exams have long been known to facilitate later recall, and a student tested after initial study of a subject retains more learning than if he or she studies longer but isn't tested 

right away. In a new paper, a psychologist surveying relevant literature found that testing has "robust benefits" when it comes to the ability of students to apply their learning in 
different contexts -- presumably the point of school. 
Another recent paper supports multiple-choice tests. In an experiment with undergraduates, a multiple-choice test improved recall more than a test without answer choices. 

Also, a multiple-choice test apparently can improve the retrieval of facts used on the test as incorrect answers.

ENVIRONMENT 
Static From Electric Cars 
Electric vehicles can help to reduce harmful greenhouse emissions, but a study suggests that, without cleaner sources of electricity, the environmental benefits would be limited. 
Judging by the likely global-warming impact, researchers found that switching to electric vehicles would be counterproductive in places where power is mainly produced by 

burning coal or heavy oil. Even when electricity is derived from relatively clean gas, the scientists write, "only limited benefits are achieved." 
The global-warming impact of manufacturing electric vehicles is about twice the comparable impact of conventional vehicles, the study says. Cleaner power and long-lasting 

electric vehicles are key, the study implies. The governmental Norwegian National Research Council funded most of the study, with the remaining 20% from a group of Norwegian hydropower and electric- grid companies and a battery maker.

LAW 
Good Looks, Hard Time? 
Women who are attractive are considered more culpable by police in domestic-violence cases, according to a study from Spain. 
Researchers presented 169 Spanish police officers with differing fictional scenarios involving a woman accused of murdering her abusive spouse. In all cases, the woman was 

described as claiming self-defense. But when the woman was described as attractive, the police officers found her more responsible for the events that had brought her to trial.

Abstract 
Supporters say making industries that burn fossil fuels pay to spit out carbon dioxide would encourage a shift to cleaner, alternative-energy sources by making it more expensive to burn coal, gasoline or natural gas. A carbon tax ensures that when people choose to use fossil fuels or engage in other activities that emit greenhouse gases, they see the full price. 

Full Text 
What price carbon? That question is splitting even those who agree that government should be pursuing policies to promote clean energy. 
Supporters say making industries that burn fossil fuels pay to spit out carbon dioxide would encourage a shift to cleaner, alternative-energy sources by making it more expensive to burn coal, gasoline or natural gas. Some favor a cap-and-trade system, which sets a limit (the cap) on emissions and creates a market where companies can buy and sell permits to discharge carbon dioxide (the trade). Others favor a simpler tack: Tax companies on the carbon they emit. 
Critics, meanwhile, say any price on carbon is misguided. A better, less costly approach, they say, would be for governments to invest directly in clean-energy technologies. 
The Wall Street Journal asked three experts -- David Weisbach, a professor of law at the University of Chicago; Eileen Claussen, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions; and Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the think tank Breakthrough Institute -- to debate the issue. 
Here are edited excerpts of their discussion: 
WSJ: Do we need a price on carbon? If so, what's the best way to do it? 
MR. WEISBACH: We need a price on carbon for the simple reason that activities that result in emissions don't bear their full cost. 
A carbon tax ensures that when people choose to use fossil fuels or engage in other activities that emit greenhouse gases, they see the full price. Without a carbon tax, people don't consider all of the costs of their activities when making choices, such as how much to drive, how big a house to buy and so forth. Without a tax, it is as if we subsidize pollution relative to its price in a complete market. 
MS. CLAUSSEN: There are many reasons to put a price on carbon, the most important being that climate change is already costing society (through extreme weather events), and we need to take action to limit those costs. 
A cap-and-trade system has the advantage of letting policy makers decide the policy objective (to reduce emissions by a certain amount), and letting the market find the lowest-cost way of doing so. With a tax, the government decides the amount of the tax and hopes that the level selected meets a particular objective. 
MR. NORDHAUS: Accelerating the rate of technological change through direct support for technological innovation and commercialization will prove to be vastly more important to how much it costs to deal with climate change or, for that matter, whether we do much of anything about it at all. 
We deal with all kinds of harms without pricing them. We conquered cholera and other diseases, cleaned up our rivers and our skies, and dramatically improved the safety of our roads, all without pricing. U.S. emissions are declining faster than any place else in the world today without a price on carbon. 
MS. CLAUSSEN: And why are our emissions declining? One reason is certainly the state of the economy. I would rather have a robust economy and declining emissions, and that is why I believe pricing carbon should be the cornerstone of our effort. 
MR. NORDHAUS: The European Union economy has also suffered, yet U.S. emissions have declined faster without a price on carbon than EU emissions have declined with one. 
U.S. emissions are declining more rapidly because cheap natural gas, made possible in significant part thanks to three decades of public investment in unconventional gas technologies, is rapidly displacing coal. The EU, despite its vaunted cap-and-trade program, continues to build new coal plants. History suggests that outside of economic recessions and depressions, the only measures that have succeeded in driving long-term decarbonization rates have been policies to directly encourage the shift to cleaner energy supplies -- nuclear in France and Sweden, gas in the U.K., and dirty coal to cleaner coal in Germany after reunification. 
That is what we did over three decades with gas. Federal investments were key to virtually every critical technology -- horizontal drilling, multidimensional imaging, downhole motors, super-efficient gas turbines -- that made the gas revolution possible. We will need the same kind of commitment to develop cost-effective renewables, nuclear and transportation technologies in order to sustain the current emissions declines that new gas technologies are driving and that will be even more important in the developing world, where the lion's share of future emissions will come from. 
MS. CLAUSSEN: While the switch to gas has displaced conventional coal and therefore reduced emissions, it is also likely to displace nuclear and renewables. Keep in mind that gas still emits a lot of carbon. 
A price on carbon can help create a level playing field that will increase the demand for all low-carbon and no-carbon technologies. To dismiss that idea, particularly in lean budget times where we aren't likely to see huge investments in clean technologies, seems awfully foolish. 
WSJ: Would a price on carbon make other technologies -- wind, solar, nuclear or carbon capture -- more attractive and viable? 
MR. WEISBACH: A price on carbon would make natural gas relatively less expensive than coal, so we would shift even more away from coal and into gas. It also makes carbon-free energy more attractive then gas, so wind, solar, etc., would be relatively more competitive. With a carbon tax, clean energy can compete with fossil fuels on an even footing. 
MR. NORDHAUS: There is little evidence that pricing consistent with anything that anyone thinks even remotely plausible politically would create sufficient incentive to deploy substantially more wind, solar, nuclear, or really anything other than gas. 
The only two nations in the world that have ever achieved long-term rates of decarbonization consistent with mitigating climate change are France and Sweden. Both did so through direct, public deployment of the only zero-carbon technology we have capable of displacing large amounts of fossil energy: nuclear power. 
MS. CLAUSSEN: [Under a cap-and-trade program], the ability to trade is an added incentive to innovate and have extra allowances to sell. 
But another issue is certainty going out into the future. If the cap-and-trade program has a clear set of objectives over time, companies will have an easier time making the capital expenditures [needed for technology development]. Public utility commissions would also have the policy rationale to approve higher-cost technologies, knowing they would be necessary in the future. 
MR. WEISBACH: A carbon tax doesn't require an initial allocation of permits. Thus the temptation to give the permits to politically favored industries doesn't present itself. I think this is a very substantial benefit of a tax. 
WSJ: Since economies benefit from cheap energy, how would you mitigate the cost of making energy more expensive by pricing carbon? 
MS. CLAUSSEN: Tax revenue raised from a carbon tax can be used to mitigate costs or to reduce taxes on other productive resources like employment. Similarly, allowances can be distributed to those impacted, or they can be sold and the revenue used to mitigate the costs and/or reduce other taxes. Under a tax, a likely outcome is that you get a lot of tax exemptions, which undermines the environmental effectiveness of the program. 
Under cap and trade, you get a lot of free allowance allocation, where you still get your environmentally effective program. 
MR. WEISBACH: A tax provides a steady and easy-to-see price signal. Businesses would know exactly what the price is and could make plans given that price. With a cap-and­trade system, the price is constantly changing based on market whims. What probably matters even more than whether we have a tax or cap and trade is how we manage the transition to a carbon price and how we deal with industries that are exposed to competition from businesses operating in countries without a price. 
MR. NORDHAUS: What will determine the success of climate mitigation will be how rapidly you can drive down the cost of zero-carbon alternatives. Making fossil energy more expensive won't have much impact on emissions unless the alternatives get much cheaper. By contrast, making clean energy much cheaper will have significant impact on emissions even if you don't price carbon.

The Readers Weigh In: Carbon Emissions 
Should there be a price on carbon-dioxide emissions? 
Here's a sampling of comments from a WSJ.com poll. You can vote and make your voice heard at WSJ.com/Reports. 
Yes! Better to tax something harmful than tax beneficial things like payroll, income, investments. 
Adam 
Yes, let's all stop using the main ingredient that makes our economy work. Brilliant idea! 
Andy Engle 
Companies are only going to get serious about clean investments once it makes business sense. The simplest way to make emissions reduction economical is to tax emissions. 

For economists, that's a no-brainer. It's also a no-brainer that revenue from a carbon tax would allow us to lower taxes on payrolls and income. Why should pollution be free and 
hard work be punished? 
Peter 
How do you justify a tax to reduce fossil fuel consumption that will likely do more damage to the economy when there is no realistic alternative for the vast majority of users? 
Christopher Reid 
Just what America needs: more taxes! Because you know the average person can totally afford it now! 
Brian Olson 
I can see a tax on coal and oil as long as the money goes to investments in alternative energy sources to reduce our energy dependence. 
Klars 
Why not make those who dirty the air pay for it to be cleaned? I'd also like to see better incentives for using clean, alternative energy, and solar panels for home use. 
Ron Smiley 
Taxing industry is the same as taxing the people. They will pass the extra cost on to us.

Abstract 
Proponents say wind and solar subsidies are needed for a few more years to allow these clean, renewable sources of energy to develop to the point where they can compete on price with electricity produced from coal and natural gas. 

Full Text 
At a time of intense debate over the federal budget, government subsidies for wind and solar power are more contentious than ever. The question of whether those subsidies are justified has taken on fresh urgency with the looming expiration of a major wind subsidy. 
The federal tax credit for wind-power producers will expire at the end of this year unless Congress extends it. There is widespread agreement that pulling the plug on the subsidy at this point could hobble the wind-power industry. Meanwhile, the biggest federal subsidy for solar power, a tax credit for 30% of the cost of installed equipment, is set to drop to 10% at the end of 2016. A cash grant for up to 30% of solar equipment costs expired at the end of last year. 
Proponents say wind and solar subsidies are needed for a few more years to allow these clean, renewable sources of energy to develop to the point where they can compete on price with electricity produced from coal and natural gas. But opponents of the subsidies say that they simply cost too much, and that the supposed benefits of wind and solar power are overstated. 
Yes: They Are Doing Their Job 
By Mark Muro 
Federal subsidies for wind and solar power production are working. In fact, they're working so well that they don't need to continue much longer. But we do need to extend them for a few more years so that they can fulfill their purpose. 
Let's remember the point of these temporary subsidies: to help emerging clean-energy technologies gain toeholds in challenging markets and advance toward unsubsidized price-competitiveness. 
The ultimate reward is cheaper, cleaner energy and greater energy diversity, which will help guard against price shocks, keep energy costs down through competition and lessen the damage our energy consumption does to the environment, among other things. The benefits are well worth the cost of temporarily extending these subsidies, which are a trivial portion of the federal budget. 
Wind and solar need the help because the barriers for new technologies in the energy industry are tougher than those in any other industry in this country. Fossil fuels, with the help of their own government subsidies over the years, are thoroughly entrenched, with trillions of dollars' worth of infrastructure in place. At the same time, utilities tend to favor established business models and are required by regulators to provide the lowest-cost power, all of which steers them toward fossil fuels. 
Against this background, providing temporary support for wind and solar technologies so they can gain the level of scale and efficiency necessary to compete is one of the few ways the nation can reasonably hope to promote energy diversity. 
Is it working? The evidence is overwhelming that it is: Supported by subsidies but also by rapid technical advances, onshore wind and solar photovoltaic installations are way up, and the price of delivered renewable energy is way down. 
Onshore wind power is on track to reach grid parity -- the point where its cost equals the base-line price of power on the grid -- starting in 2016, according to estimates from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research arm of Bloomberg LP. Solar photovoltaic energy will be largely cost-competitive at the residential level in California without the current subsidy by 2017 and in many other states shortly thereafter, according to Shayle Kann, a vice president at the GTM Research unit of Greentech Media Inc. 
In sum, onshore wind is likely just a few years away from true subsidy independence, while several forms of solar aren't far beyond. 
So Congress should finish the job it started by extending the present subsidies. But it shouldn't just extend them for a year or two and then stage yet another politicized, all-or­nothing confrontation when the next expiration dates near. 
Instead, Congress should provide a predictable, continual prod toward innovation and cost reduction by extending the subsidies further than it usually does but at the same time establishing a cutoff date. For example, the subsidy for wind power could be renewed and then phased out over four years or so. Key members of Congress already are discussing this "extend but discipline" approach. 
Meanwhile, to help wind and solar meet new subsidy-independence deadlines, more attention should be given to expanding the opportunities for private investment. Currently, solar and wind infrastructure can't be financed using master limited partnerships or real-estate investment trusts, two powerful tools. State governments also could pitch in by ratcheting up the requirements for utilities to generate a certain amount of their power from renewable sources. They could also dedicate some of the significant funds they manage through state energy offices to financing renewables, and establish clean-energy-finance banks. 
It all starts, though, with a new approach to subsidies. When key wind and solar supports come up for renewal, Congress should extend them so it can then end them.

No: The Benefits Are a Myth 
By David Kreutzer 
The problem with subsidizing wind and solar power is that subsidies don't make these unaffordable energy sources affordable, they just change who pays. Taxpayers foot a large part of the bill, instead of the producers and consumers of wind and solar power. And the costs that imposes on the economy aren't justified by any of the supposed benefits of these energy sources. 
The argument that wind and solar energy are on the verge of being cost-effective is an old one, dating at least to the early 1990s. And yet we are still handing out subsidies that supposedly will push them over that line in just a few more years. It's time to stop. With a phaseout or not, extending subsidies is just more of the same. 
Numerous studies purport to show that energy subsidies will stimulate the economy by creating jobs. But these studies consistently ignore the fact that draining taxes out of the general economy to pay for those subsidies runs the broader job-creating mechanism in reverse. The net effect is to shrink the economy, not grow it. 
Another myth is that we need subsidies to stay competitive with countries whose economies will increasingly be propelled by wind and solar energy. That argument needs to be written on a dry-erase board, because the country that is supposedly outcompeting us on this front keeps changing. That's because our competitors keep bailing out of their subsidy schemes. The purported European models, such as Spain and Germany, have drastically cut their subsidies, because they were unaffordable and unworkable. 
The current name on the board is China. This is an economic role model? China's per capita income ranks 92nd in the world. Yes, China's economy has grown dramatically in recent decades, but only because they moved toward freer markets -- that is, toward an economy a little more like ours. In any event, China's total carbon-dioxide emissions are skyrocketing. Whatever they may be doing with wind and solar power pales in comparison with what they are doing with coal-fired electricity. 
A third myth asserts that these subsidies will save the planet. Broad agreement that man-made carbon-dioxide emissions warm the Earth doesn't mean we are headed to environmental catastrophe. Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for instance, projects a sea-level rise of about seven to 24 inches over the next century -- not 20 feet. Recent trends argue more strongly for the lower end of that range. 
There is nearly universal agreement that an all-out carbon-cutting policy in the U.S. -- of which wind and solar subsidies are only a small part -- would do next to nothing to moderate any global warming. This is because future carbon emissions will come overwhelmingly from the developing world, which shows little appetite for squeezing economic growth to cut a few inches from sea level. 
Yet another myth is that we need subsidies to move us toward the energy of the future before we run out of fossil fuels. 
Once again, the Malthusians are wrong. Thanks to technological advances in recent years, the world has centuries of untapped natural gas and coal at its disposal -- much of it relatively cheap and right here in the U.S. It's simple: We don't need wind and solar to keep the lights on. 
Surely some alternatives to fossil fuels will be developed, but they will only work if they are affordable. Wind and solar aren't, and that isn't changed by shifting the costs from consumers and producers to the taxpayers. 
Bureaucrats and politicians shouldn't be the ones deciding which technologies are the most promising or what timeline is too long or what losses are too deep. The market will do a much better job of answering the question: Are wind and solar power really viable? 
Let's get rid of the subsidies and find out.

The Readers Weigh In: Subsidies for Alternative Energy 
What should happen to federal subsidies for alternative energy? 
Here's a sample of comments from a WSJ.com poll. 
Until someone develops a way to store electricity, wind technology is a loser. When wind stops blowing it cannot power even one house. Your coal plants pick up the slack. 
Jim Pairitz 
No subsidies. The government has a poor track record of picking winners and losers in the marketplace. 
Mike 
We subsidize oil. We even go to war for oil. Why can't we subsidize solar and wind and liberate ourselves from dependency on oil? 
Josephine 
Everyone mentions oil and gas "subsidies," but they are depreciation write-offs available to all industries. 

Tom Yoke 
Most of the comments against renewable energy subsidies ignore the very real economic costs of the many externalities created by the use of fossil fuels, such as health effects from pollution. 
David E. Bruderly 
Solar and wind power are the only way to go, to keep our planet sustainable. I want my grandchildren to live in a healthy place.

Abstract 
Given that the retreat of Arctic ice has become a key piece of evidence for those who take a more alarmed view of global warming, it's newsworthy that 2012's melt was the greatest since records began in 1979, with sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere shrinking to about 1.3 million square miles, or about half the 1979-2008 average. 

Full Text 
This week probably saw the Arctic Ocean's sea ice reach its minimum extent for the year and begin to expand again, as it usually does in mid-September. Given that the retreat of Arctic ice has become a key piece of evidence for those who take a more alarmed view of global warming, it's newsworthy that 2012's melt was the greatest since records began in 1979, with sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere shrinking to about 1.3 million square miles, or about half the 1979-2008 average. 
As this column has sometimes pointed out ways in which the effects of global warming are happening more slowly than predicted, it is fair to record that this rate of decline in Arctic sea ice is faster than many predicted. Although an entirely ice-free Arctic Ocean during at least one week a year is still several decades away at this rate, we are halfway there after just three decades. 
Arctic melts on this scale have happened before, however. Svend Funder of the Danish Museum of Natural History and his colleagues recently studied the northern coast of Greenland, where the land-fast sea ice never breaks up, even in a year like this. Yet evidence of wave action in the past (indicating open waters) and waterlogged driftwood show that for 2,500 years in the "Holocene Optimum" period, when Arctic summer temperatures were two to four degrees Celsius warmer than today, the summer melt of the Arctic Ocean routinely left half as much ice as this year. 
Another study, by Jorgen Berge and colleagues from the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway, and other institutions, discovered a downward migration of egg-carrying amphipod crustaceans that enables them to recolonize Arctic ice from ice-free areas using deep currents. They say this implies that some animals are well adapted to the seasonal loss of ice. 
In the Holocene Optimum there was no collapse of the polar-bear population or "point of no return." The extent of Arctic summer sea ice then increased steadily, reaching a maximum during the very recent so-called Little Ice Age of 1500-1850. Potential confirmation that this was an unusually icy epoch comes from a newly published study by Durham University (in Britain) of the genetics of Arctic foxes on Iceland. 
Greger Larson and his colleagues found that the remains of 17 Arctic foxes in Iceland from the ninth to the 12th centuries shared a single genetic signature, while the modern Icelandic fox population has five different genetic types. During the cold centuries, they infer, genetically diverse Arctic foxes from the Eurasian continent apparently reached Iceland via sea ice. 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the extent of summer Arctic sea ice then shrank after 1850, before expanding in the 1960s. Clearly, the Arctic Ocean's sea ice is both more variable and more vulnerable to warming than expected. But is the current rapid retreat caused only by warming? At least some of it might be caused by soot from dirty, coal-fired power stations. Some scientists have noticed that the decline in Arctic sea ice correlates better with the rapid growth of coal consumption in China than it does with global temperature. As the argument goes: Soot falling on white ice darkens it, which results in faster melting in summer sun. 
Correlation does not always mean causation, but if soot is contributing to sea-ice melt, then it is moderately good news, because cleaning up soot emissions from power stations could be both cheaper and quicker than cutting carbon-dioxide emissions. 
There's also the puzzling fact that Antarctic sea ice shows no sign of summer retreat, and the current winter's peak extent is well above average. The sea-dominated Southern Hemisphere is certainly warming more slowly than the land-dominated Northern Hemisphere, but it has still been warming. If warming is supposed to be "global," shouldn't sea ice retreat at both ends of the world?

Abstract 
While the GOP platform mentions "cost-effective" development of renewable energy, the Democrats are more emphatic in their support for clean energy, despite lingering political fallout from the bankruptcy of solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra LLC, a recipient of federal loan guarantees. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The revolution in U.S. oil and gas production over the past four years has changed the platforms of both political parties, with Democrats and Republicans more 
bullish on these resources and less concerned about climate change than they were during the last presidential election. 
Democrats have moved so far that their platform bears a striking resemblance to the GOP platform of 2008. At the same time, the 2012 Republican platform has jettisoned 
many of the policies it championed four years ago to focus largely on increased fossil-fuel production. 

The new Democratic platform includes a brief, favorable mention of clean coal -- an issue of interest to voters in coal-producing Pennsylvania and Ohio, the latter of which is a 

key swing state. 
President Barack Obama said in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention Thursday night that his approach to energy would create more jobs -- including 600,000 
jobs in the natural-gas sector, thanks to the boom in U.S. shale gas production. 

Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney's energy plan would roll back advances made in energy security -- such as decreased reliance on foreign oil -- although the Republican plan 

would ramp up domestic production of oil and gas. 
Notably, Mr. Obama avoided mention of any further action on climate change, after an administration-backed cap-and-trade bill sank in the Senate in 2010. He said, instead, 
that the administration's push for clean energy, cleaner coal and tougher auto fuel economy standards would help curb greenhouse-gas emissions. "Climate change is not a 
hoax," he said. 

Many Republicans and those in the energy industry say the administration's actions have been less accommodating to fossil-fuel development than its words would suggest. Critics cite its nixing of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and increased environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing, the process known as "fracking" that is used to drill for natural gas. 
The Republican platform gives coal and oil more prominence than it did four years ago, decrying what it calls the Obama administration's "war on coal." 
"We are going to need everything we have to meet expected electricity demand. We certainly cannot just overnight stop using coal," said Rep. Ed Whitfield (R., Ky.), chairman of 
the House subcommittee on energy and a drafter of the Republican platform's energy section. 
While the GOP platform mentions "cost-effective" development of renewable energy, the Democrats are more emphatic in their support for clean energy, despite lingering 

political fallout from the bankruptcy of solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra LLC, a recipient of federal loan guarantees. The Democrats reaffirmed their goal of getting 80% of 

electricity from clean-energy sources by 2035 and called for "extending incentives" for clean energy. 
Republicans have long called for vigorous oil and gas development, as they showed with the "Drill, baby, drill" chants at their 2008 convention. But this year's platform pushes 
further on several specifics. It calls for opening up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and recommends opening areas along the Atlantic coast to oil production. 

In 2008, GOP presidential nominee John McCain was the co-author of Senate legislation to enact a cap-and-trade system to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. The 2008 GOP 

platform reflected concern about climate change, supporting "technology-driven, market-based solutions that will decrease emissions." 
Democrats who once favored more-drastic measures to combat climate change have ended up pretty much where Mr. McCain was back then. The new platform says Democrats 
favor "reducing our emissions domestically" through "regulation and market solutions," but doesn't mention cap-and-trade legislation. 

Other similarities exist between today's Democrats and their rivals of 2008 -- such as the talk of balancing environmental goals with economic growth. 
Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has come out against tax credits for renewable energy, and the GOP platform this year is silent on the issue. 
The 2012 GOP platform also states explicitly that "we oppose any and all cap-and-trade legislation." It also calls on Congress to block the Environmental Protection Agency from 

implementing court-ordered greenhouse-gas regulations. 

"I think there's been a significant shift in our party," Mr. Whitfield said. "There has been more of an emphasis on market-based decisions, and let's reduce the involvement of 
government."

Abstract 
Just as policy can make the climate crisis worse -- mandating biofuels has not only encouraged rain forest destruction, releasing carbon, but driven millions into poverty and hunger -- technology can make it better. 

Full Text 
Matt Ridley writing at Wired.com, Aug. 17: 
In the climate debate, we hear a lot from those who think disaster is inexorable if not inevitable, and a lot from those who think it is all a hoax. We hardly ever allow the moderate "lukewarmers" a voice: those who suspect that the net positive feedbacks from water vapor in the atmosphere are low, so that we face only 1 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming this century; that the Greenland ice sheet may melt but no faster than its current rate of less than 1 percent per century; that net increases in rainfall (and carbon dioxide concentration) may improve agricultural productivity; that ecosystems have survived sudden temperature lurches before; and that adaptation to gradual change may be both cheaper and less ecologically damaging than a rapid and brutal decision to give up fossil fuels cold turkey. 
We've already seen some evidence that humans can forestall warming-related catastrophes. A good example is malaria, which was once widely predicted to get worse as a result of climate change. Yet . . . [m]alaria-specific mortality plummeted in the first decade of the current century by an astonishing 25 percent. The weather may well have grown more hospitable to mosquitoes during that time. But any effects of warming were more than counteracted by pesticides, new antimalarial drugs, better drainage, and economic development. 
Just as policy can make the climate crisis worse -- mandating biofuels has not only encouraged rain forest destruction, releasing carbon, but driven millions into poverty and hunger -- technology can make it better. If plant breeders boost rice yields, then people may get richer and afford better protection against extreme weather. If nuclear engineers make fusion (or thorium fission) cost-effective, then carbon emissions may suddenly fall. If gas replaces coal . . . then carbon emissions may rise more slowly. . . . We will combat our ecological threats in the future by innovating to meet them as they arise, not through the mass fear stoked by worst-case scenarios.

Abstract 
Obama campaign officials, in a conference call with reporters, said Mr. Romney was ignoring other ways to reduce dependence on imported oil, such as the automobile fuel-efficiency standards Mr. Obama has imposed. 

Full Text 
HOBBS, N.M. -- Mitt Romney's energy plan, which he outlined Thursday at an oil-field supply shop here, would reverse efforts by President Barack Obama's Interior Department to tighten rules on companies extracting oil and natural gas on federal lands. 
Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, laid out the benefits he sees in drilling on federal lands and waters, saying a hands-off regulatory approach would boost output and create jobs. 
Some of Mr. Romney's proposals, including giving states control over drilling permits for wells located on federal land, would likely meet Democratic resistance, and passage would depend on the partisan balance in Congress. 
"I like wind and solar like the next person," Mr. Romney said. "But I don't want the law to be used to stop the production of oil and gas and coal." 
Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for the Obama campaign, said the Romney plan "really is just rubber-stamping oil companies' drilling plans without fully considering safety." 
Environmental groups said the plan neglected new energy sources and didn't address climate change. "We need to invest in and support policies that promote the growth of cleaner energy alternatives," said Yvette Pena Lopes, deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a partnership of labor unions and environmental groups. 
Industry groups praised Romney's plan. Virginia Lazenby, chief executive of Nashville oil and gas company Bretagne LLC, said it "incorporates the appropriate role of government in energy policy, which must be to promote energy development rather than stifle it." 
During the Obama administration, the government has adopted environmental safety rules for the drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing and established stricter rules for deep-water drilling. It also decreased the number of onshore and offshore drilling permits exempted from environmental review, a fast-track approach used regularly under President George W. Bush. 
The result has been fewer federal drilling leases issued and fewer permits granted. Overall fossil-fuel production on federal lands and waters has remained relatively steady since Mr. Obama took office, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
Mr. Romney's promise to expedite a permitting process he called "extraordinarily slow" would be felt in states like Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, which have fossil-fuel reserves located on large, federally overseen tracts. His plan would open to drilling areas off the Atlantic coast, near Virginia and the Carolinas; Mr. Obama's five-year plan, which he released earlier this year, would not. 
On Thursday, Mr. Romney said his plan would create "more good wages -- that's an opportunity for more Americans to have a bright and prosperous future." 
Mr. Romney said his plan went beyond the economy, assuring "we have all of the energy we need to keep America powered and to make sure that our military never has to borrow from someone across the ocean that might not be our best friend." 
Obama campaign officials, in a conference call with reporters, said Mr. Romney was ignoring other ways to reduce dependence on imported oil, such as the automobile fuel-efficiency standards Mr. Obama has imposed. 
Federico Pena, who served as transportation secretary during the Clinton administration and spoke on the call, said such efficiency efforts were the "most cost-effective thing we can do to reduce our dependence" on oil. 
Mr. Romney said in February that such standards "hurt domestic auto makers" in the past and that they "must not be overly burdensome."

Abstract 
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's per capita electricity consumption is about 600 kilowatt-hours per year. 

Full Text 
Blackouts crippled India last week, leaving more than 600 million people without electricity. Trains were stranded, traffic snarled, and the country's economy ground to a halt. According to news reports, the blackouts were caused by excess demand, with some states in northern India taking more power than they had been allotted by the grid operator. And while the investigation into the disaster continues, one result is certain: India won't be abandoning coal any time soon. 
While the Sierra Club pushes its "beyond coal" campaign here in the U.S., and the Obama administration continues its regulatory attack on the coal industry -- an effort that includes the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to prohibit the construction of new coal-fired generation units -- India and other countries around the world are rapidly increasing their coal consumption. 
Proof of that can be seen in the fact that, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, global coal consumption over the past decade has increased by more than the growth in oil, natural gas, hydro and nuclear combined. Much of that surge in coal use has occurred in India, the world's third-largest coal consumer, behind only China and the 
U.S. Increasing coal use helps explain why India's carbon-dioxide emissions, up by 80% since 2002, and global carbon-dioxide emissions -- up by 30% since 2002 -- continue to soar. 
India's current coal use, which is the energy equivalent of about 5.9 million barrels of oil per day, has nearly doubled over the past decade. Yet the country remains chronically short of electricity. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's per capita electricity consumption is about 600 kilowatt-hours per year. This is a small amount compared to the other big electricity users. The average Chinese uses about five times as much electricity as the average Indian, while the average American uses about 20 times more. 
To alleviate the shortages, India is aggressively expanding its electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. It is also working hard to increase its natural-gas and nuclear-generation capacities, but it still relies on coal for about two-thirds of its electricity production. With 60 billion tons of domestic coal reserves -- enough to last a century at current rates of extraction -- India has plenty of the carbon-heavy fuel. But the country's mines are inefficient and coal deliveries have been hamstrung by poor-quality transportation and ham-handed government policies. The result: India imported about 20% of the coal it used in 2011, and it may soon surpass China as the world's biggest coal importer. 
For years, Indian leaders have been saying they will not let concerns about climate change impede their push to generate more electricity. In 2009, shortly before the big climate-change meeting in Copenhagen, that message was delivered by none other than Rajendra Pachauri, the Indian academic who chairs the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. "Can you imagine 400 million people who do not have a light bulb in their homes?" he asked. "You cannot, in a democracy, ignore some of these realities and as it happens with the resources of coal that India has, we really don't have any choice but to use coal." 
Use it they will. In the wake of the blackouts, Indian officials are talking about expediting the permits needed to produce and transport more coal. And the IEA is projecting that India's coal consumption will nearly double by 2030, allowing it to surpass the United States. But even if that occurs, India will likely continue to lag the developed world in producing electricity -- the currency of modernity. 
Slogans like "beyond coal" may appeal to Sierra Clubbers and to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who gave the environmental group $50 million to help "end the coal era." But with 1.3 billion people on the planet still lacking access to electricity, the priority for leaders in places like New Delhi isn't carbon-dioxide emissions or "clean energy." Their primary aim is to bring their people out of the dark.

Regarding Stephen Moore's "When the Moore Family Lost Power," op-ed, July 5): I installed solar panels on my house in Washington, D.C., taking advantage of subsidies two years ago. The panels provide approximately 40% of our total electrical needs, and approximately $1,800 in cash benefits (the savings on my electric bills plus money received from the sale of renewable-energy credits) gives me a 15% return on my net invested dollars. And in the little over two years that we've had the solar panels, we have reduced our household contribution to carbon in the atmosphere by more than 10 tons. This is a more accurate picture of the green-energy future. 
David Tillotson 
Washington 
Mr. Moore has pretty much summed up the situation concerning coal, natural gas and oil. The greenies and the present administration they elected must have skipped physics and math classes during their education. One should look at the number of joules in low-cost fuels and compare that to joules hitting a square meter from solar energy or wind power. We saw solar and wind power on farms in Africa and New Zealand, but they were in very isolated areas with no better recourse for energy. 
Oh, by the way, the administration has cut funds for fusion research, which is like shooting ourselves in the foot. 
Loren Lund 
Yakima, Wash. 
While the Moore family was enduring its three sweltering days, I was enjoying a three-week backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York with my 12-year-old son and my 14-year-old daughter. We experienced the same heat as the Moore family did, but our perspective was certainly different. 
When we concluded our trip, we returned to our home, our gas-fueled cars, electricity and even our Xbox. But we also returned with a belief that our earth's resources are limited, and we should take reasonable steps to conserve and protect our planet. We are not part of a "green group," nor are we "global-warming alarmists." Living outside for a few weeks each year has caused us to develop an appreciation for our environment and a concern for the forces that threaten it. We have become more concerned about the sustainability of our planet's resources, and we have become more suspect of practices that put our water, air and food sources at risk. Our family has learned that we can grow by living for a few days-- or even a few weeks-- without electricity. 
Clifford King 
Sarasota, Fla. 
What did kids do before modern necessities like air conditioning and electricity? Kids used to go outside and play. Even in sweaty, sticky places like Washington, D.C., in the summer, they played. They played baseball, basketball, capture the flag, marbles and a million other games with their friends. Sure, it wasn't as comfortable as sitting in a cool house, catching up with peers on Facebook, but it was fun -- a lot of fun. 
You don't need to wait for another power outage for that next great teaching moment. Pry your kids off the sofa and get them out of the house now. Let them learn for themselves that playing manhunt with neighborhood kids or building fairy houses in the backyard is a much better way to spend their childhoods than sitting inside watching reruns on TV. 
Patty Goffinet 
Melbourne, Fla. 
Mr. Moore's power outage wasn't caused by "green groups . . . focused on reducing our access to electrical power," nor the Obama administration working to stop pollution from the combustion of coal, nor Sierra Club concerns about hydraulic fracturing, nor concerns about the wisdom of deep-water drilling off the shore of Florida. 
His problem was caused by his total dependence on electricity made from fossil energy sources with an obsolete, centralized electricity production and distribution system. American entrepreneurs and engineers know how to solve this problem. Unfortunately, obsolete government and utility policies defended by conservative politicians are stifling innovation and hindering progress. 
The centralized electric-power production and distribution system failed because it was severely damaged by an extreme weather event. The utility companies are spending millions to replace this failed system with above-ground distribution lines that could easily be destroyed again by a chaotic weather event next year. This is ironic as chaotic weather events are just some of the millions of data points that scientists now know to be symptoms of continuing global warming. Scientists have measured the cause of increased CO2 combustion of fossil fuels used to produce the type of electricity Mr. Moore's kids could no longer access.

Abstract 
Regulators and industry colleagues described Mr. Rogers as someone who can dazzle a dinner audience, offering solutions to public-policy issues, such as global warming and energy conservation, and who is less focused on the humdrum aspects of running day-to-day utility operations. 

Full Text 
In the electric-utility industry, where leaders earn kudos for quietly increasing dividends and tending to their knitting, Duke Energy Corp. Chief Executive Jim Rogers has always cut a flashier figure. 
Slight of stature but with an outsize personality, Mr. Rogers has carved out a role for himself as an energy visionary, espousing big ideas in venues -- from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central -- outside the reach or interest of most utility executives. 
Now the 64-year-old Kentucky lawyer is in the spotlight for another reason: his role in what some people are calling a boardroom coup at one of the nation's biggest utilities. Under a 2011 merger agreement with Progress Energy Inc., Mr. Rogers was slated to become executive chairman of the combined company and Progress Chief Executive Bill Johnson was to become CEO. But just hours after the $26 billion deal closed last Monday, the Duke-dominated board ousted Mr. Johnson and made Mr. Rogers CEO. 
The move surprised North Carolina regulators, who have started an investigation into whether they were misled and have called Mr. Rogers to testify at a hearing Tuesday. He has agreed to appear. 
The sudden switch infuriated some of Progress's former directors, who last week accused Duke's board of dealing in bad faith. And it has raised concerns among some Wall Street analysts about corporate governance at Duke, where the board includes longtime friends of Mr. Rogers, such as former Indiana Rep. Phil Sharp. Mr. Sharp couldn't be reached for comment Sunday. 
The board has refused to explain the switch or say why it soured on Mr. Johnson. Mr. Rogers hasn't discussed the matter and didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Johnson declined an interview request. 
In a career that has spanned more than two decades in the utility business, Mr. Rogers has survived several other mergers, always coming out on top. As CEO of Indiana utility operator PSI Resources Inc., Mr. Rogers led the company to tie up in 1994 with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. and emerged as chief of the combined company. When that new company, Cinergy Corp., was acquired by the larger Duke, Mr. Rogers wound up as Duke's CEO in 2006 and chairman in 2007. 
In Washington, "presidents come and go, but Jim Rogers seems to be forever," said Frank O'Donnell, the head of Clean Air Watch, which lobbies for stronger air-pollution regulations. 
Regulators and industry colleagues described Mr. Rogers as someone who can dazzle a dinner audience, offering solutions to public-policy issues, such as global warming and energy conservation, and who is less focused on the humdrum aspects of running day-to-day utility operations. 
A full travel schedule, which allowed him to hobnob with public figures in Europe and China, where he raised $676 million for Duke, often kept him away from company headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. As indication of how much he travels, he used Duke's corporate jets for $406,000 in personal travel last year, according to proxy filings. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said Mr. Rogers has been an outstanding CEO and is responsible for a total shareholder return of 1245% at companies he has run since 1988, easily beating the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
"Jim is a big-idea guy, a bold thinker," said a fan, Michael Smith, president of Charlotte Center City Partners, a nonprofit group that promotes downtown Charlotte. "He is someone who knows what is going on in Southeast Asia, what is going on in Brazil, what people were talking about at Davos." 
Mr. Rogers said during a dinner at a private club in Washington last October that as executive chairman of the combined company, he expected "to do more of the public-interest stuff I am interested in,"" an acquaintance recalled. 
Mr. Rogers had said in a conference call with investors that he also planned to deal with regulators and institutional investors. 
Former Ohio utility Commissioner Don Mason said Mr. Rogers regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings with commissioners to talk about his vision for Duke. "He did a wonderful job of relationship building," Mr. Mason said. 
Mr. Rogers began his career as a newspaperman, covering police and courts at the Lexington Herald-Leader, before attending law school at the University of Kentucky. He served as a deputy general counsel at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which polices interstate electricity sales and pipelines. He also ran interstate pipelines for Enron Corp., the Houston energy company that collapsed a decade ago. 
On his watch, Duke grew into one of the largest electricity companies in the country, with more than four million customers in five states before the Progress merger. 
But his tenure has sparked controversy. 
An Indiana power plant called Edwardsport, which Mr. Rogers touted as one of the first "clean coal" facilities of its size in the world, is about $1 billion over budget. State regulators plan to hold hearings this month on whether to let the company pass along $2.6 billion of the $3.3 billion cost to ratepayers. 
Duke has been accused of exerting improper communications with Indiana regulators, which prompted the resignation of the chairman of the Indiana utilities commission and several Duke executives, including its chief operating officer. The company has denied wrongdoing. Authorities are investigating. 
Although Duke derives roughly half its electricity from coal-fired power plants, Mr. Rogers was a proponent of federal cap-and-trade legislation that would have penalized utilities for exceeding certain limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, to which coal plants are a contributor. He disagreed, however, with details of the resulting legislation, which has since fallen out of favor in Washington. 
Mr. Rogers's statements upset fellow utility executives, who accused him of trying to use the legislative process to gain an unfair advantage over other companies. 
He was frank about his reasons for engaging in the legislative process. "If you're not at the table, you're going to be on the menu," he said. 
Mr. Rogers is active in civic affairs in Charlotte and was a leading figure in the successful drive to lure this year's Democratic National Convention to the city, appealing to Republicans and Democrats alike to donate money as an expression of civic pride. He agreed to raise $36 million in noncorporate contributions, kicking in $100,000 from his own pocket. He now serves as co-chairman of the convention's host committee. 
His activism has raised speculation that he might be interested in a post in Washington, an ambassadorship or running for office. 
Mr. Williams, the Duke spokesman, said that's not the case. "He has no desire to hold public office," Mr. Williams said. "He enjoys being CEO."

Abstract 
[...]that doesn't stop a global-warming alarmists like James Hansen, a lead scientist at NASA, from likening trains carrying coal to the German "death trains" that transported the Jews to Nazi concentration camps. Natural gas is our second major source of electrical energy and thanks to the technological miracle of hydraulic fracturing we have hundreds of years of this clean-burning resource that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 

Full Text 
Last weekend the Moore household was one of nearly a million homes in the Washington, D.C., area without power. The temperature was between 95 and 105 degrees and it was so humid you felt like you needed gills to breathe. 
Sure, I explained to my three children, we're miserable, but look at the bright side: Think how much we've reduced our carbon footprint! Consider it a life lesson in what it means to live green. 
That's small solace to youngsters who feel that life without Facebook, World of Warcraft, ESPN, Xbox, cellphones and air conditioning is like losing basic human rights. What, no microwave popcorn? Domino's Pizza isn't coming with a meat-eaters special? Someone call Amnesty International. 
On Saturday night we all sat on the couch with flickering candle light, sweating and talking. What did people do before the age of electricity?" my 11-year-old asks. "I would have killed myself," he moans. 
Electrical power is the central nervous system of our modern economy and our 21st-century lifestyles, and living without it for a few days reminds us how vulnerable we are to being sent back to a pre-Industrial Age. Yet every initiative by green groups is focused on reducing our access to electrical power -- although they never admit that explicitly. 
This power outage was caused by a severe thunderstorm from Mother Nature, but I'm convinced that rolling brown outs are coming, thanks to the radical environmental movement that has taken hold of our body politic. Green groups, for example, have declared war on coal, which still produces about 40% of our electricity. The Obama administration is listening and slamming the brakes on coal production. This cheap and domestically abundant energy source is getting cleaner all the time, thanks to technological progress. But that doesn't stop a global-warming alarmists like James Hansen, a lead scientist at NASA, from likening trains carrying coal to the German "death trains" that transported the Jews to Nazi concentration camps. 
Natural gas is our second major source of electrical energy and thanks to the technological miracle of hydraulic fracturing we have hundreds of years of this clean-burning resource that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. But the Sierra Club is vowing to shut down natural gas too. Just last week North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue vetoed a fracking bill in the Tar Heel State (overridden on Tuesday thanks only to a state legislator's mistaken vote). She says she's protecting drinking water, but as we've discovered in Virginia, when you lose electricity you often lose access to potable water. 
Of course, Big Green hates oil and nuclear power too. That's why we're not drilling for oil in many parts of Alaska and on other energy-rich federal lands and waters, and why we're not building the Keystone XL pipeline. This is public policy that is not just anti-growth but dangerous to our health and safety. 
Sadly, kids are being bombarded in school at a very young age with propaganda that says to save the planet we have a moral obligation to conserve electricity and use "alternative energy." But safe and cheap electricity is what will save the planet from doom. If global warming is a threat, we are not going to be saved by building windmills or riding our bicycles to work, but by using advanced technology and electrical power to find ways to cool the planet. 
Higher standards of living, huge improvements in health and environmental conditions, and longer life expectancy are the fruits of economic growth that abundant electrical power makes possible. Go to the Internet and call up aerial photos of rich and capitalist South Korea and statist and desperately poor North Korea. South Korea is alive in light, North Koreans live in the dark. Limiting access to cheap electricity is one of the first actions of a successful tyrant. 
There's one more teachable moment from our three days in the dark. So many Americans -- spoon-fed by a "go green" education system and media -- live under the delusion that things were better in the past than they are now. Sure the economy is bad, but all we had to do is live for 72 hours without AC, TV, a dishwasher, a hair dryer and Google to appreciate how much progress has been made in the past 20, 30, and 50 years. Today a larger percentage of poor people have access to air conditioning than the average middle-class family did in 1960. 
For several days the Moore family was powerless. It was awful, but educational. If anything good has come out of this debacle, it is that our household has a new appreciation for how important it is that everyone have access to affordable and reliable sources of energy. 
The left says we can get our power from "clean, renewable" sources like wind and solar power. After tens of billions in subsidies, these sources provide 3% of our electricity. Anyone who thinks we can power our $15 trillion economy with wind and solar power is living in the dark -- or wants the rest of us to as well.

Full Text 
A federal appeals court backed the Obama administration's campaign to limit greenhouse-gas emissions, in a blow to the coal industry and other companies that say regulators acted without a scientific basis and are stifling job creation. 
The court in Washington, D.C., gave the Environmental Protection Agency almost everything it wanted in the 82-page ruling on Tuesday. A three-judge panel unanimously upheld the EPA's central 2009 finding that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide endanger public health and likely have been responsible for global warming over the past half century. 
The ruling drew immediate fire from companies that say the EPA exceeded its powers under the Clean Air Act, signed by Richard Nixon in 1970. 
A spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Southern Co., owner of four electric utilities, said the company "continues to believe that the Clean Air Act is ill-suited to handle issues like greenhouse gases, and that Congress should be the policy maker in this area." 
The court's ruling is likely to echo in this year's elections, where Republicans, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney, are charging the Obama administration with undermining job growth through tighter environmental rules. 
Mr. Romney's camp this month unveiled a television ad in Ohio, a major coal-mining state, that envisions the first months of a Romney administration and says, "By day 100, President Romney repeals regulations that are strangling our energy industry and costing us jobs." Mr. Romney has said that he wants to amend the Clean Air Act to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate carbon dioxide. 
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said the decision was "a strong validation" of the agency's approach. The court held that "EPA followed both the science and the law in taking common-sense, reasonable actions to address the very real threat of climate change by limiting greenhouse-gas pollution from the largest sources," she said. 
The court also upheld EPA rules that drew on its 2009 finding, including greenhouse-gas emissions standards for cars that took effect beginning with the 2012 model year. 
Unlike some other industries, auto makers support the Obama administration on the greenhouse-gas rules, saying it is easier to have a common national standard than to leave regulation to the 50 states, some of which would be likely to adopt their own rules if Washington didn't. 
A Ford spokeswoman said the auto maker is "supportive of one national framework" for regulating fuel-economy and tailpipe emissions. "We are committed to increasing the fuel economy of our vehicles," she said. 
On Tuesday, Ford presented its 2013 model lineup, stressing vehicles such as the hybrid version of the Fusion midsized sedan that, according to Ford, will go 47 miles on a gallon of gasoline, and a battery-powered Ford Focus said to offer the equivalent of 110 miles per gallon with no carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Under the George W. Bush administration, the EPA contended it didn't have the power to regulate greenhouse gases. But the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in 2007 that the Clean Air Act not only gave the EPA such power, but obligated the agency to exercise it if greenhouse gases were found to be harmful. 
After Mr. Obama's EPA followed up on the high-court ruling with new regulations, industry groups sued, saying there was too much uncertainty about global warming for the agency to act as it did. 
Tuesday's ruling flatly rejected that contention. The opinion, issued jointly by three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said the EPA "marshaled substantial scientific evidence" to support its findings. "The existence of some uncertainty does not, without more, warrant invalidation of an endangerment finding," the court wrote. 
Chief Judge David Sentelle, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, and Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel, both appointees of President Bill Clinton, issued the decision. 
The ruling allows the EPA to move forward with additional efforts to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from industrial sources. The EPA is now working to make final its first set of national limits on carbon dioxide from new coal-fired power plants. 
The standards, first proposed in March, are expected to make construction of new coal plants increasingly unlikely as power generators opt for natural gas. 
In recent months, utilities have announced they plan to mothball dozens of coal-fired power plants, responding to EPA rules that restrict release of pollutants like mercury, in addition to greenhouse gases. 
Plants burning natural gas often release about half as much carbon dioxide as plants burning coal, and plentiful new supplies of natural gas in the U.S. have made the fuel price-competitive. 
Southern Co. and Duke Energy Corp. are building two "clean coal" power plants that will turn coal into a combustible gas to make electricity. But the cost of the plants -- about $3 billion apiece -- means that the technology is unlikely to be widely adopted. 
The challengers could ask the full appeals court to rehear the case or seek Supreme Court review. Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli of Virginia, one of the law's challengers, said the state plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
Such efforts, however, may face long odds. At several points in Tuesday's ruling, the three-judge panel indicated it had little difficulty in rejecting many of the challengers' arguments. 
Among other things, some challengers said they wanted to block the EPA from phasing in the greenhouse-gas regulations. They said that phase-in, by easing the pain on companies, postponed the day when Congress would have to act to remove the burden more thoroughly. 
The court said the companies didn't have legal standing to make that argument and cited an episode of the old Saturday morning cartoon "Schoolhouse Rock" that explained the long and difficult journey for any bill. "As a generation of schoolchildren knows . . . [it's] not easy to become a law," the court said.

Abstract 
According to statistics from the emergency disasters database, deaths caused by flooding, droughts, heat waves and storms -- including the effects of global warming -- now account for about one-twentieth of one percent of all deaths in the developing world. 

Full Text 
The United Nations environment summit in Rio this week is a great example of how good intentions can thwart real progress on global problems. 
What's the world's biggest environmental challenge? Ask the global elites at U.N. conferences, and they're likely to answer: "global warming." Global warming is indeed a concern, and we need smart solutions. But let's put things in perspective. According to statistics from the emergency disasters database, deaths caused by flooding, droughts, heat waves and storms -- including the effects of global warming -- now account for about one-twentieth of one percent of all deaths in the developing world. From 1990-2007, that averaged about 27,000 deaths per year. 
By contrast, lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation kills almost three million annually. Almost two million people, meanwhile, die each year inhaling smoke from inefficient and dirty fuels such as dried animal dung, crop residues and wood. Another one million die from the effects of outdoor air pollution. 
All told, more than 13% of Third World deaths -- about six million in total -- stem from air and water pollution. This means that for every global warming-related death, at least 210 people die each year from old-fashioned air and water pollution. 
Even an extremely ambitious climate policy -- aiming to cut global carbon-dioxide emissions by 50% below 1990s levels -- would entail enormous costs but save very few lives. Inexpensive policy changes, however, could virtually eliminate pollution-related deaths, which are so much more numerous than global warming-related ones. 
Why then, do U.N. elites focus all their efforts on a feeble attempt to assist one person before successfully preventing 210 deaths? Because global warming feels more important -- more hip. The majority of people in wealthy countries have lived their entire lives with clean air, clean water and electricity supplied through a grid. Air and water pollution is just old hat. 
But surely "helping the world" isn't about making us feel good. It's about actually helping poor nations. 
Nowhere are these misplaced priorities more apparent than in U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's favorite program, "sustainable energy for all," which has emerged as a key goal of this year's summit. The program aims to ensure that all people have access to energy, but it places an inordinate emphasis on "green" technologies. 
The program's celebrity backers correctly point out that 1.3 billion people lack electricity, meaning it's "lights out" when the sun goes down. They rightly anguish that three billion people rely on dirty fuels. But then they argue that "green" energy is the way to help. 
Why would we choose inefficient, intermittent and costly technologies to solve a simple problem? Simply put: Because it makes us feel good. 
Take former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, a member of Mr. Ban's global sustainability panel. In a recent statement, she gave perhaps the starkest example of attempting to solve a substantial problem with a feel-good policy: "Smoke from wood, dung and coal from cooking and heating remains one of the world's major public health problems. Major investment is needed to accelerate the move away from carbon fuels and to improve energy efficiency." 
Sure, sometimes solar panels in far-flung communities can work. But generally, reliable electricity for those billion-plus people who lack it should come from simple, cheap solutions like hooking up generators or, better yet, power plants -- which, just like ours, mostly run on fossil fuels. 
The same goes for tackling indoor air pollution. In some circumstances, solar cookers can be a good idea. But the technologies that have served us well, such as kerosene and natural gas, are much more likely to be cheap, flexible and useful for hundreds of millions of people. 
It's the height of arrogance to think that Third World countries should use weak and expensive technologies just to make some in the West feel good. In essence, the global elite is telling coughing Third World people sitting in their dark hovels: "Get a solar panel." That's akin to telling people suffering from water pollution to drink Perrier. Or indeed, to suggest that breadless people should eat cake. 
There are real and often overlooked environmental problems to be tackled. We need to talk less about ineffective, "feel-good" solutions to global warming and more about smart fixes to air and water pollution. We need to take back our environmental summits from the well-meaning glitterati and do what works.

Abstract 
Everyone in Washington calls it that, and everyone claims to be in favor of it too: natural gas, solar, coal, biofuels, hydro, nuclear, oil, wind, the works. [...]markets are demolishing coal more effectively than government. Since 1990, power companies have selected coal for merely 6% of new generation. 

Full Text 
New York -- 'I'm here to talk about what we're calling an 'all of the above' energy strategy," President Obama said the other day. Funny, Mitt Romney also calls it that. Everyone in Washington calls it that, and everyone claims to be in favor of it too: natural gas, solar, coal, biofuels, hydro, nuclear, oil, wind, the works. But almost nobody supports "all of the above," not really. 
In theory, liberals want to phase out fossil fuels in the name of climate change. In theory, conservatives oppose subsidies for renewables, unless they like ethanol, but then they also support subsidies for nuclear and often oil and gas. And in practice, both political parties tend to dump ideology and support whatever status quo energy sources predominate in their home districts. 
Tom Fanning's home district, so to speak, is Georgia and Alabama and parts of Mississippi and Florida -- the region powered by Southern Company. The giant utility's CEO and chairman is among the few who take what he calls an "all the arrows in the quiver" approach -- perhaps to differentiate himself from the Washingtonians -- though he notes slyly that "We actually believe in the dogma." 
Even as natural gas booms and coal-fired power falls dramatically, Southern is building new coal plants, in Kemper County, Miss. Outside Waynesboro, Ga., work is under way on the islands and cooling tower of what by 2016 will become the first new U.S. nuclear unit since the Jimmy Carter era. In Nacogdoches, Texas, Southern is building one of the country's largest commercial renewable-power stations, which will convert trash from lumber making and other forms of waste biomass into electricity. 
For Mr. Fanning, this is common sense. He likens it to diversifying an investment portfolio: "You don't pick one stock." He may be right that "all of the above" is a sensible approach, but it isn't common -- either in politics or in the electric industry. Mr. Fanning has emerged as one of the most trenchant (in fact, one of the only) critics of the transformative switch to gas from coal. Mr. Fanning explains, "It just doubles down your risk into one segment that looks promising today but nobody can sit here and tell me that it's going to be safe forever, safe in terms of economics and reliability." 
In that sense, Southern's "genetic conservatism" -- Mr. Fanning's term -- may also be Exhibit A for the growing left-right coalition that wants to "make business boring again" in the too-big-to-fail era. They favor a return to something like the postwar business model that prevailed until the deregulation wave of the 1980s -- safer but less competitive, more stable but also less entrepreneurial. 
Boring is the wrong word for someone as effusive and iconoclastic as Mr. Fanning, but he does belong to a corporate culture that rejects barbarians-at-the-gate capitalism. He likes to invoke "Beta," the financial measure of the volatility of an asset in relation to the overall market. "Last year," he says proudly, "among the S&P 500, we had the second-lowest Beta. The only company that beat us was . . . Hormel. They make Spam! Southern may not be exciting, but we're dependable and we work like crazy to be dependable." 
To those who favor a business world with less risk and fewer vampire squids, Mr. Fanning is your guy. 
Mr. Fanning sat down with the Journal editorial board recently amid "an historic shift" in the electric industry. King Coal is in twilight. For decades it was the engine of the U.S. power system, delivering nearly 60% of net generation by the 1980s. Southern illustrates the new reality; the share of its generation mix from coal has plunged to 35% in 2012 from 70% only five years ago. Meanwhile, gas has climbed to 47% from 16%. 
One major reason, both at Southern and industry-wide, is the Environmental Protection Agency, which has been regulating against carbon like crazy. The EPA has effectively banned new coal and other rules are grinding down the existing fleet. 
Mr. Fanning views the EPA's campaign as a special kind of recklessness. "It's terribly unwise in my view to create a regulatory regime that bans one of the nation's most plentiful resources. We own 28% of the world's coal reserves -- we have a blessing of wealth. It should be brought to bear here in America. If not, due to regulatory policy, it will be burned for the benefit of the citizens of China or India or elsewhere." He's right: Exports have nearly doubled since 2007. 
On the other hand, markets are demolishing coal more effectively than government. Since 1990, power companies have selected coal for merely 6% of new generation. Gas was the fuel for 77%, even as coal has been far more competitive than it is today. 
Now gas enjoys a huge price advantage, driven by the hydraulic-fracturing techno-revolution and the vast shale reserves of the greater Midwest. When gas is trading at $6 per million British thermal units, it is 50% cheaper than coal over the life of a power plant. Today, gas is trading near $2. 
Mr. Fanning isn't so sure. "When you think about the kind of time horizon that a business like ours is in, where you put capital-intensive assets in the ground with a 30- or 40­year economic life, you need to think long term," he says. So here's the skeptic's case. 
"Nationwide, I think we're going to be consuming over 50% more gas going forward than we currently do," Mr. Fanning notes, "or at least there's a good potential for that." Demand for gas is growing not merely for baseload electricity but in manufacturing, chemicals, transportation, other industries. Consumption is also lagging below trend given the weak economy. 
Even with many more wells and increased production, Mr. Fanning thinks gas prices will return to their historic oscillations and eventually spike. "Gas has traditionally been way more volatile certainly than coal and nuclear," he says. "So you're buying a more volatile product. You're creating a higher-Beta energy policy." 
As coal recedes, Mr. Fanning warns that customers may be forced to rely on sources that are less productive and more expensive because there's nothing to pick up the slack. "If conventional coal is not going to get done, and there's only a few people who can do nuclear -- this ain't a job for beginners -- you're left with gas and, heaven forbid, renewables?" He cautions: "Now I'm as excited about renewables as anybody. But they're a niche play." 
Other risks to ultracheap gas are political. Fracking could slow if government decides to "move beyond gas" with bad regulations, and a carbon tax or cap and trade could return. Natural-gas exports will also grow as the U.S. builds more terminals and producers see business opportunities in Europe and Asia. "You're going to see a harmonization of world-wide gas prices," much like the global commodity markets for oil. "Right now essentially the U.S. has a dividend coming to the economy in terms of cheap energy," says Mr. Fanning, who doesn't think it can last. 
"Believe me," he continues. "I think gas will be the dominant resource going forward. But I am not willing to subject my customers to the risk of betting it all on gas." 
For most of the 20th century, the consensus was that utilities like Southern were natural monopolies. The physics of electricity are simple and begat industrial organization: Because power can't be stored except in small quantities, supply and demand must be in balance at every instant. The thinking was that only one central authority could effectively manage the grid and coordinate the large-scale deployment of capital. 
The same reasoning used to apply to the rest of the economy: Markets could only function if they were structured as cartels and competition suppressed. Thus the oligopolies in railroads, radio and television licenses, phone lines, air travel. Thus the separation of investment and commercial banking under the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. 
Deregulation -- the insight that competition could generate new efficiencies -- did not come to the electricity markets until the 1980s and '90s. Though it now sells some power in the wholesale markets, Southern defeated bids (including from the likes of Enron) to restructure markets in Georgia and Alabama, and Mr. Fanning says that "by any yardstick my customers are better off" as a result. 
As he sees it, the kind of "managed competition" that prevails elsewhere gives energy companies the incentive to increase prices at the margin. They can thereby increase their profitability as revenue rises but fixed costs don't. The people who favor competition, he says, "are making a self-serving economic argument. They don't face market pressure to do what's best for consumers." 
The vertically integrated, regulated utility, Mr. Fanning adds, "should be the dominant solution" because it ensures corporate cultures "are set up in terms of their ability to succeed in both the long and short run." He calls such companies "birds of prey," with Southern as "a classic bird of prey. We don't chase fads. And yet, we are able to produce yearly results year after year after year." 
"Moving prey" are companies that prioritize the next quarter's bottom line at the expense of long-range viability. "And of course road kill," he jokes, "are companies that can't do either." 
Mr. Fanning thinks U.S. business has a "moving prey" problem. "The Beta of the United States economy is higher than it has ever has been," he says. Not enough people understand "how growing systematic risk hurts the ability of the United States to generate economic growth that is regular, predictable and sustainable." 
The problem, in a word, Mr. Fanning continues, is "chasing that last increment of return without regard for risk. We all know from our schooling that value is a function of risk and return. Risk is as important as return. And I think so often given the herd mentality we see in the markets, people forget that." 
Mr. Fanning has a business philosophy that used to be considered old-fashioned, until recently. It could avoid destruction a la 2008. But it would most definitely thwart creative destruction as well.

Abstract 
Facebook has made a commitment to power its growing data-center fleet with renewable energy and will push its electricity suppliers, such as Duke Energy in North Carolina, to scale up renewable-energy options to meet its growing demand. 

Full Text 
Robert Bryce's "Renewable Energy Can't Run the Cloud" (op-ed, May 29) ignores the reality that many of the largest technology companies in the world are already using renewable energy to do exactly that. 
Google has invested $915 million to date in clean-energy development and powers its data centers in places like Iowa and Oklahoma via long-term contracts for wind energy. Facebook has made a commitment to power its growing data-center fleet with renewable energy and will push its electricity suppliers, such as Duke Energy in North Carolina, to scale up renewable-energy options to meet its growing demand. 
Apple is now saying it will power its three current data centers with coal-free energy by the end of 2013. 
The biggest, most profitable tech companies in the world want to power their data centers with renewable energy because it's smart business. They understand the need to rid their energy supply chain of fossil fuels that poison communities and cause climate change. 
Mr. Bryce does correctly note that there is not yet enough renewable energy to power a rapidly expanding data-center infrastructure. That is true today, but it is changing as more tech companies follow Google and Facebook's lead by recognizing the long-term wisdom of renewable energy and pushing utilities to invest in it. The growing cloud can be the engine that drives the switch from coal to renewable energy, a shift that will be good for tech companies' bottom line and good for all of our health.

Abstract 
According to a report this year by Broll Property Group, an affiliate of CBRE Group Inc., the tax would have a "huge effect" on the property sector, which would be responsible for "around 23%" of the total tax. 

Full Text 
JOHANNESBURG -- Facing skyrocketing energy costs and the introduction of one of the world's first carbon taxes, South African real-estate developers are ramping up efforts to develop energy-efficient buildings -- from modern office towers to housing for the poor. 
For several years, South Africa has been a leader on the continent in the development of so-called "green" buildings that use cutting-edge materials, technology and construction techniques, to minimize energy use. So far, though, most of the major projects have involved showcase office buildings for large corporations like Nestle South Africa and Procter & Gamble Co. 
Now, a broader range of developers are going green. Growthpoint Properties, which owns and manages more than 412 office buildings, shopping centers and other commercial properties in South Africa, has made efficient energy use core to its investment strategy, says Justin Mitchell, who has the title of sustainability coordinator at Growthpoint. "To be honest, it all comes down to the energy crisis we are in," he says. 
In November, when Durban hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, the nonprofit Green Building Council showcased a project that upgraded 30 township homes -- occupied by families with incomes that averaged about $354 a month. The buildings added such features as solar water heaters, insulated ceilings, energy efficient lighting and rainwater harvesting systems. 
"Green buildings can be about large headquarters of governments and companies, but it also can be about the Main Street of a township," says Roger Platt, senior vice president of the U.S. Green Building Council, a sister organization to the group in South Africa. 
South Africa's green-building push reflects the country's position as the continent's largest economy -- and responsible for nearly 40% of its total carbon dioxide emissions. With the country heavily reliant on coal, the price of electricity has increased about 25% a year since 2008, according to the government's Department of Trade and Industry. 
South Africa also has been stepping out on the global stage as a strong advocate of efforts to battle climate change. Looking to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 42% by 2025, the National Treasury proposed a carbon tax earlier this year, to take effect in 2013, that initially would charge businesses $16 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. 
Real-estate industry executives have been considering the plans cautiously. According to a report this year by Broll Property Group, an affiliate of CBRE Group Inc., the tax would have a "huge effect" on the property sector, which would be responsible for "around 23%" of the total tax. 
"Property is unlikely to be overlooked in this process, and on an initial basis it is likely to affect the cost line of all participants in the property sector, from developers, to tenants and landlords," says Mabuse Moja, a research analyst for Investec, a specialist bank and asset-management firm based in South Africa. 
But some developers also are seeing the benefits of saving energy. 
Green technology typically cuts electricity consumption by about 40% and water consumption by about 15%, according to Germando Cardoso, development director at Tiber Bonvec, a large South African construction firm. 
Tiber Bonvec recently spent about $5 million retrofitting a former auto showroom to develop premier green-office space in Sandton, Johannesburg's main business district. The office space, which was completed in February, includes recycled water and motion sensors that cut electricity use.

U.S. News: Industry Tries to Ease Fracking Worry

Abstract 
"The fact that these emissions are much less than earlier, more limited estimates . . . is good news for the future of U.S. natural gas development and the game changing benefits of job creation and economic growth that will come with it," American Petroleum Institute director Howard Feldman said. 

Full Text 
The natural-gas industry opened its first major attempt Monday to rein in concerns that a greenhouse gas released during drilling endangers the environment, saying government emissions estimates are far too high. 
Concerns over methane, the primary component in natural gas, have risen as hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," becomes more common and unleashes a boom in natural-gas production. In fracking, companies pump water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into the ground, creating fractures in shale rock that makes it easier for natural gas to escape. 
Some methane escapes into the atmosphere as the natural gas is being drilled and transported, but experts differ over how much. 
A pair of influential energy groups, the American Petroleum Institute and America's Natural Gas Alliance, released a study Monday finding that the Environmental Protection Agency's estimates of emissions were twice as high as their own. The groups estimated that 4.4 million metric tons of methane escaped from producing unconventional natural gas in 2010, whereas the EPA has determined that number to be nearly 8.8 million metric tons. 
"The fact that these emissions are much less than earlier, more limited estimates . . . is good news for the future of U.S. natural gas development and the game changing benefits of job creation and economic growth that will come with it," American Petroleum Institute director Howard Feldman said. 
He added that the industry "has been reducing emissions and will continue to reduce emissions." 
The two groups said the largest source of methane emissions in the U.S. was "enteric fermentation" -- gas produced in the guts of cows and other ruminant animals and expelled. The EPA has said natural-gas drilling was No. 1. 
Of the new industry report, the EPA said, "We are always open to reviewing relevant information that may help inform the science around important standards." 
The EPA in April said it would require oil and natural-gas companies to use equipment that prevents emissions from escaping into the atmosphere. The rule targeted emissions known as volatile organic compounds, but the agency said it also would lead to cuts in methane. 
The science on methane leaks is in its early stages. Earlier this year, university scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund said natural gas was better for the environment than coal when used for generating electricity. But its benefits are questionable when used as a fuel for cars and heavy-duty trucks, they said in a report examining methane leaks from gas production, processing and delivery. 
Robert Howarth, a Cornell University professor of ecology and environmental biology and a vocal critic of natural-gas drilling, has said natural gas could be worse for global warming than coal because of what he describes as large methane leaks. "It's foolhardy to pursue shale gas further based on the information we have on hand," Mr. Howarth said in an interview. 
President Barack Obama has promoted natural gas as a valuable domestic fuel. Under his watch, the EPA has passed stringent new rules for coal-fired power plants that has hastened the retirement of aging coal units and spurred the construction of natural-gas plants. 
If the concern over methane leaks continues to build, it could have big consequences for the natural-gas industry. The environmental group Sierra Club already is trying to block exports of natural gas because it says exports would encourage more production and lead to greater emissions. 
"People are paying attention [to methane emissions] because natural gas could become the dominant fuel source for the country," Sierra Club lawyer Craig Segall said.

WASHINGTON STATE 
Gunman Kills 4 in Seattle, 
Shoots Himself, Police Say 
A gunman killed four people in Seattle on Wednesday -- three at a cafe and another in a carjacking -- before he apparently shot himself as officers closed in following a citywide 

manhunt, authorities said. 
He was listed in critical condition at a local hospital. 
Police searching for the suspect in the cafe shooting near the University of Washington also had to respond to another fatal incident near the city's downtown. They say a man 

killed a woman in an apparent carjacking and fled in a black SUV. Authorities said late Wednesday they believe one man was responsible for both attacks. 

The cafe shooting happened Wednesday morning at Cafe Racer, a restaurant and music venue north of the University of Washington. The gunman was described as a man in his 30s. Two men died at the scene. A woman from the cafe died at a hospital. -- Associated Press 
NEW MEXICO 
Wildfire Spreads, Becomes 
Largest in State's History 
A wildfire that has burned more than 265 square miles in the Gila National Forest has become the largest fire in New Mexico history, fire officials confirmed Wednesday. 
The blaze grew overnight to more than 170,000 acres, surpassing a fire last year that burned 156,593 acres in Los Conchas and threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory 

nuclear facility. 
The Gila fire formed last week when two lightning-sparked blazes merged in an isolated mountainous area in southwestern New Mexico. 
Fire information officer Jerry Perry said that about 1,200 firefighters from around the state were battling the growing blaze, but that they continue to face low humidity and 

shifting winds in their efforts. 
The fire hasn't been contained, and officials worry that shifting winds and dryness related to the state's record drought may cause the blaze to grow even more. 
-- Associated Press 

WASHINGTON STATE Seattle Voices Opposition To Plans for Coal Exports Seattle has become the latest Northwest city to challenge the export of U.S. coal to Asia, as the city council declared its opposition to moving coal through the city. "The City of Seattle opposes the establishment of coal export terminals in Washington State," read the text of a resolution passed by a unanimous 9-0 vote Tuesday. While lacking the power of law, the resolution targeted firms exploring the opening of coal-export terminals in Washington and Oregon. Tacoma, Wash., said last year it wouldn't 
accept a coal terminal. Opposition has also grown to exports at sites in Oregon, such Coos Bay and on the Columbia River. 
"Seattle has a commitment to fight climate change" said council member Mike O'Brien, head of the Energy and Environment Committee and prime sponsor of the resolution.

Cross Country: California Declares War on Suburbia

Full Text 
It's no secret that California's regulatory and tax climate is driving business investment to other states. California's high cost of living also is driving people away. Since 2000 more than 1.6 million people have fled, and my own research as well as that of others points to high housing prices as the principal factor. 
The exodus is likely to accelerate. California has declared war on the most popular housing choice, the single family, detached home -- all in the name of saving the planet. 
Metropolitan area governments are adopting plans that would require most new housing to be built at 20 or more to the acre, which is at least five times the traditional quarter acre per house. State and regional planners also seek to radically restructure urban areas, forcing much of the new hyperdensity development into narrowly confined corridors. 
In San Francisco and San Jose, for example, the Association of Bay Area Governments has proposed that only 3% of new housing built by 2035 would be allowed on or beyond the "urban fringe" -- where current housing ends and the countryside begins. Over two-thirds of the housing for the projected two million new residents in these metro areas would be multifamily -- that is, apartments and condo complexes -- and concentrated along major thoroughfares such as Telegraph Avenue in the East Bay and El Camino Real on the Peninsula. 
For its part, the Southern California Association of Governments wants to require more than one-half of the new housing in Los Angeles County and five other Southern California counties to be concentrated in dense, so-called transit villages, with much of it at an even higher 30 or more units per acre. 
To understand how dramatic a change this would be, consider that if the planners have their way, 68% of new housing in Southern California by 2035 would be condos and apartment complexes. This contrasts with Census Bureau data showing that single-family, detached homes represented more than 80% of the increase in the region's housing stock between 2000 and 2010. 
The campaign against suburbia is the result of laws passed in 2006 (the Global Warming Solutions Act) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and in 2008 (the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act) on urban planning. The latter law, as the Los Angeles Times aptly characterized it, was intended to "control suburban sprawl, build homes closer to downtown and reduce commuter driving, thus decreasing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions." In short, to discourage automobile use. 
If the planners have their way, the state's famously unaffordable housing could become even more unaffordable. 
Over the past 40 years, median house prices have doubled relative to household incomes in the Golden State. Why? In 1998, Dartmouth economist William Fischel found that California's housing had been nearly as affordable as the rest of the nation until the more restrictive regulations, such as development moratoria, urban growth boundaries, and overly expensive impact fees came into effect starting in the 1970s. Other economic studies, such as by Stephen Malpezzi at the University of Wisconsin, also have documented the strong relationship between more intense land-use regulations and exorbitant house prices. 
The love affair urban planners have for a future ruled by mass transit will be obscenely expensive and would not reduce traffic congestion. In San Diego, for example, an expanded bus and rail transit system is planned to receive more than half of the $48.4 billion in total highway and transit spending through 2050. Yet transit would increase its share of travel to a measly 4% from its current tiny 2%, according to data in the San Diego Association of Governments regional transportation plan. This slight increase in mass transit ridership would be swamped by higher traffic volumes. 
Higher population densities in the future means greater traffic congestion, because additional households in the future will continue to use their cars for most trips. In the San Diego metropolitan area, where the average one-way work trip travel time is 28 minutes, only 14% of work and higher education locations could be reached within 30 minutes by transit in 2050. But 70% or more of such locations will continue to be accessible in 30 minutes by car. 
Rather than protest the extravagance, California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris instead has sued San Diego because she thinks transit was not favored enough in the plan and thereby violates the legislative planning requirements enacted in 2006 and 2008. Her predecessor (Jerry Brown, who is now the governor) similarly sued San Bernardino County in 2007. 
California's war on suburbia is unnecessary, even considering the state's lofty climate-change goals. For example, a 2007 report by McKinsey, co-sponsored by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, concluded that substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions could be achieved while "traveling the same mileage" and without denser urban housing. The report recommended cost-effective strategies such as improved vehicle economy, improving the carbon efficiency of residential and commercial buildings, upgrading coal-fired electricity plants, and converting more electricity production to natural gas. 
Ali Modarres of the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles has shown that a disproportionate share of migrating households are young. This is at least in part because it is better to raise children with backyards than on condominium balconies. A less affordable California, with less attractive housing, could disadvantage the state as much as its already destructive policies toward business. 
Mr. Cox, a transportation consultant, served three terms on the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission under the late Mayor Tom Bradley.

The Obama administration on Tuesday announced long-awaited rules to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from new power plants that will effectively block the construction of new coal-burning plants and make natural gas even more attractive as a fuel for generating electricity. 
The rules, in the works since late 2009, will add more stress to the beleaguered coal-mining sector while encouraging development of renewable energy, and will add to Republicans' complaints of regulatory overreach by the Obama administration ahead of the November elections. 
Published Tuesday, the rules will take months to finalize, and might not be finished by November. The rules face serious opposition in Congress, and the legal underpinnings already are being challenged in court. 
Existing power plants, including about 15 that are under construction or will be in the next year, won't be affected by the rules. New power plants will be limited to emissions of 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced. 
Most gas-fired power plants built since 2005 meet that standard, but coal plants can't unless they are fitted with special equipment to capture the carbon emissions and store them underground. Although that technology is commercially available, it is prohibitively expensive, utilities and energy analysts say. 
The rules will simply reinforce the existing trend in power generation: Cheap natural gas is the favored fuel for new electricity generation, often edging out coal and nuclear power. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projected natural-gas power plants to be the main source of new generation capacity in the next two decades even before the rule was announced. 
"This standard isn't the once-and-for-all solution to our environmental challenge, but it is an important common-sense step toward tackling the ongoing and very real threat of climate change and protecting the future for generations to come," said the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Lisa Jackson. 
Despite the EPA's insistence that the new rule will still allow advanced coal plants to be built, many critics aren't convinced. "This really is a ban on new coal-fired generation. The EPA knows that," said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani LLP in Washington and former head of the EPA's air office under President George W. Bush. 
Nick Akins, chief executive of American Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio, one of the biggest coal users in the U.S., said carbon-capture technology is technically available, "but whether it's economically available is another question." AEP pulled the plug last summer on a high-profile pilot program to capture emissions from one of its plants in West Virginia because the utility couldn't recover the costs of the program from its customers. 
But Ralph Izzo, CEO of Public Service Enterprise Group, a big New Jersey utility, said the EPA rule "establishes a logical and modest standard for new electric-power plants and provides the industry with much needed regulatory certainty." 
The EPA prepared the new rules to comply with a legal obligation stemming from a 2007 Supreme Court case. The latest rules come on the heels of a spate of other EPA regulations to limit the emissions of harmful pollutants from power plants. 
Republican politicians have jumped on the new proposals as an example of what they see as the administration's regulatory excess. Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.), a vocal critic of the administration's efforts to tackle climate change, said he would try to overturn the regulation in Congress. 
In contrast, environmental groups and Democrats were broadly pleased with the new measures. Some environmental groups, however, are concerned that by excluding existing power plants, the new rules will actually encourage power companies to prolong the life of existing coal-fired power plants. 
"We have not been pleased with every move the administration has made," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that has aggressively worked to halt construction of coal-fired power plants. "But this will be seen as a milestone for how power is generated in the future," he said. He said that he expected the new rule to lead to a "dogfight" between power plants using natural gas and renewable energy such as wind and solar power, because they all meet the new emissions standards. 
The mining industry, already reeling from falling demand caused by cheap natural gas and a warm winter, views the new EPA rule as an attempt by the Obama administration to drive coal out of the electricity-generation business. 
"They are threatening to destroy coal-based generation," said Luke Popovich, a National Mining Association spokesman. 
With the new rule, the mining industry will look to the export market for relief. Asian coal demand more than doubled in the past decade, led by China and India. However, U.S. miners are constrained by rail and port limitations, and exports will only partially offset declining domestic consumption. 
In drafting the new rules, the EPA determined that they would have no discernible, additional impact on the U.S. economy, employment, electricity prices or electricity availability, because most utilities are building power plants that run on natural gas anyway. 
Some in the power sector disputed that claim. "When combined with the myriad of other regulations proposed, adopted or currently planned by EPA, the [new rules] will present a near and present danger to the reliability of the electric grid and the nation's economy," the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a trade group mostly consisting of coal-burning utilities, wrote to the administration earlier this month.

Abstract 
The president's endorsing natural gas in his State of the Union address was an incomparable victory for the industry, because I heard the president four years ago. First of all, I don't think it's a war. 

Full Text 
The U.S. is producing more oil every year. Natural gas, with huge supplies and low prices, keeps attracting new power producers. But environmental concerns swirl around an 
increasingly common drilling method: hydraulic fracturing, which injects water and chemicals into shale formations to extract oil and gas. 
Has the industry won the engineering battle, but lost the PR war? The Wall Street Journal's Russell Gold discussed the boom times and "fracking" with two leading figures in the 
industry: Edward E. Cohen, president and chief executive of Atlas Energy LP, and Aubrey K. McClendon, chairman and CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp. 

Here are edited excerpts of their discussion. 
MR. GOLD: How did fracking became a four-letter word? 
MR. COHEN: I think when we talk about the natural-gas industry losing the PR war, that is not correct. The president's endorsing natural gas in his State of the Union address 

was an incomparable victory for the industry, because I heard the president four years ago. He wasn't speaking favorably of natural gas. But he, like all the rest of us, can really 
learn. And he did learn. 

MR. GOLD: In New York state, towns have sued to prevent fracking in their communities. What should be done about that? 
MR. McCLENDON: First of all, I don't think it's a war. It's a discussion. America is a pluralistic society. We have discussions about a lot of things. But from my perspective, we 
have transformed the American energy environment today. We lead the world in technology and production. Four years ago the price of natural gas in this country was $13, and 
today it's $2. So we're providing an $800 million daily boost to the economy by what we've done with natural gas. 

Water Watch 
MR. GOLD: What about the lawsuits in New York? 
MR. McCLENDON: We're not involved in litigation, so I'm not familiar with it. We've drilled over 1,000 wells in Fort Worth. There have been over 5,000 wells drilled there. Has 

anything wrong happened in Fort Worth? Not that I'm aware of. 
MR. COHEN: We have wells in New York, and the person speaking out in favor of ending the moratorium on hydraulic fracturing is the governor of New York, a Democrat. 
The natural-gas industry has, to a large extent, been a loser because prices are so low. But the winner is the American people. I saw a statistic that the average American who 

heats with natural gas saved about $1,000 last year as against paying for oil. 

However, water is important. You have to solve the environmental problems about the water. I think the industry and the populace as a whole have the desire to see that the 
water problems are controlled. 
MR. McCLENDON: The amount of water we use to drill a well is equivalent to what it takes to grow 10 acres of corn one season or to keep one golf course green for two weeks. 

In Texas, 67% of water use is for agriculture; 0.5% is used for the energy industry. However, we heard that we were using too much water, so today we recycle 90% to 100%. 

MR. GOLD: Do we have any good sense as to where gas prices will be two years from now? Aren't things changing so quickly that it's very difficult to look ahead 12 or 24 
months? 
MR. COHEN: I think it's because things are changing quickly that we can see where the trend is. In a very short time we've seen a five-percentage-point increase in the share of 

electrical generation from gas. Within five years we should be very close to 50%. 

MR. McCLENDON: If you're worried about global warming, if you're worried about being asphyxiated by particulate pollution, you have to go after coal consumption. And we're 
the only scalable, affordable alternative. 
This is a world-wide phenomenon. We're going to be able to say in the next 10 years, "To hell with OPEC." 
Critic's Voice 
MR. GOLD: You both have made a great case for natural gas. Let's hear what the audience has to say. 

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: Paul Gallay [president of the environmental advocacy nonprofit Riverkeeper], you heard Aubrey McClendon. He said this is the best thing for the environment in a long time. 
MR. GALLAY: That's a beautiful story, but it's not true. Riverkeeper has been studying this issue in New York for a long time. Mr. McClendon says, "No problems in Fort Worth." There are air monitors throughout Fort Worth, and 94% of them come up with a hell of a lot of benzene that wasn't there before you started fracking. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the amount of childhood asthma is double the state average. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality says fracking is responsible for more air pollution in that area than cars, trains, trucks, planes, buses all put together. 
A study published by the National Academy of Sciences says if you're within 3,000 feet of a natural-gas well, you're going to have 17 times more methane in your groundwater than if you are farther away. 
MR. McCLENDON: I fracked 15,000 wells. Ninety-nine percent of American gas is fracked, and it has been for 50 years. [Today there are] 1.2 million wells. Where are the 1.2 million environmental disasters? 
You say fracking is a problem we don't disclose. So we disclose everything at FracFocus.org. Then you talk about water consumption, and we start to recycle 99%. Then you talk about well design, so we work with regulators in Pennsylvania and improve our well design. Then it's about fugitive methane emissions. We don't want to leak any methane. That's money to us. 
MR. COHEN: In New York and Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac University poll showed two interesting things. Most people think fracking does environmental damage, and most people believe fracking should continue because it's essential to the welfare of the nation. In that nuance I think you have the discussion.

Abstract 
If we fund basic research at a reasonable level, which the U.S. and other countries do not, if we encourage experimentation, if we do the right things, there is a chance to meet very aggressive goals in a 75-year time. If supplies of natural gas continue to expand and drilling technology keeps getting better, all you need to do is put carbon capture on that and be willing to pay for it. 

Full Text 
What will it take to deliver affordable energy while drastically slashing carbon emissions? Bill Gates has a prescription: political courage, innovation and a lot more funding. 
The Wall Street Journal's Alan Murray discussed these issues with the entrepreneur and philanthropist. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation. 
Getting to Zero 
MR. MURRAY: The Gates Foundation is focused on health, development, education. It's not focused on energy. Why are we here? 
MR. GATES: If you want to improve the situation of the poorest two billion on the planet, having the price of energy go down substantially would be the best thing you could do 

for them. That, along with the carbon constraint, is hugely important, partly because global warming makes tropical agriculture virtually impossible. 
MR. MURRAY: You've said we have to not just slow the growth of carbon emissions, but get to zero. Why? 
MR. GATES: You'll never get to zero. But if you want there not to be increased warming every year, you have to get to extremely low numbers. 
MR. MURRAY: How long will it take until only 50% of our global energy needs, as opposed to 80% today, are met by fossil fuels? 
MR. GATES: People underestimate how hard it is to make these changes. They look at intermittent energy sources, they don't think about storage and transmission. They look 

at things that are deeply subsidized and forget they're deeply subsidized. They look just at the rich world, and they don't look at where all the energy increase is taking place, 

middle- and low-income areas. 
If we fund basic research at a reasonable level, which the U.S. and other countries do not, if we encourage experimentation, if we do the right things, there is a chance to meet 
very aggressive goals in a 75-year time. 

Next-Generation Nuclear 
MR. MURRAY: You've said there are five miracles that we need to make this happen. 
MR. GATES: We don't need five. We need one of the five. 
Let's take carbon capture. If supplies of natural gas continue to expand and drilling technology keeps getting better, all you need to do is put carbon capture on that and be 

willing to pay for it. You can imagine a future where you're using a lot of natural gas and you're able to do extremely good capture, like 95%. That miracle alone would get you a 

long ways, because the planet has a lot of coal and a lot of natural gas. 
The next miracle is nuclear energy. The plants that are out in the world today are basically generation-one and -two plants. There's a few generation-three plants. The thing I'm 
investing in is a fourth-generation design. 

MR. MURRAY: Can you explain a little bit about how this technology works? 
MR. GATES: The part of uranium that's fissile -- when you hit it with a neutron, it splits in two -- is about 0.7%. The reactors we have today are burning that 0.7%. There was a 
concept that you would do a different type of reactor that would make a bunch of another element called plutonium, and then you would pull that out and then you would burn 

that. That's called breeding in a fast reactor. But plutonium is nuclear-weapons material, it's messy, and the processing you have to get through is not only environmentally 
difficult, it's extremely expensive. 
The concept of the TerraPower reactor is that in the same reactor, you both burn and breed. Instead of making plutonium and then extracting it, we take uranium -- the 99.3% 

that you normally don't do anything with -- we convert that and we burn it. The 99.3% is cheap as heck, and there's a pile of it sitting in Paducah, Kentucky, that's enough to power the United States for hundreds and hundreds of years. 
MR. MURRAY: What's the timetable for this? 
MR. GATES: By 2022, if everything goes perfectly, our demo reactor will be in place. And by 2028, assuming everything continues to go perfectly, it will be a design that could 
be replicated. 

MR. MURRAY: How often does everything go perfectly? 

MR. GATES: In nuclear? If you ignore 1979 and 1986 and 2011, we've had a good century. No, seriously. Nuclear energy, in terms of an overall safety record, is better than 
other energy. 
In Search of Storage 

MR. MURRAY: You've got three miracles to go. 
MR. GATES: You can have a miracle having to do with the rest of these energy sources, whether it's sun, wind or biofuel. The amount of land involved, the place that you can do 
it suitably and -- in the case of wind and sun -- the intermittency create a huge problem. All of them require storage and transmission. 

MR. MURRAY: Do you put probabilities on these miracles? 

MR. GATES: It's pretty hard. I think for society's sake, we need to fund basic energy research at least twice as much as we do right now. And for some of these things, you have 
to put on a serious carbon tax. 
MR. MURRAY: What are the odds of that happening in the next couple of years? 
MR. GATES: Anytime you really look close at politics, it has looked pretty ugly. Yet the U.S. has managed to do the right thing in a variety of issues. I do think, over time, that 

consensus will emerge. 
MR. MURRAY: Is natural gas a good thing or a bad thing? 
MR. GATES: If you put aside climate change, which you shouldn't do, this natural-gas thing is phenomenal. It's amazing that there may be dramatically more than the proven 

reserves we have right now. Unfortunately, even though natural gas has less CO2 emission per unit of energy, you get some leakage, and any leakage is a dramatic negative.

Abstract 
Last year Mr. Davey's government poured GBP 1.4 billion into wind and other "renewable" energy sources and mandated utilities to use them, the most noticeable result of which is soaring electricity bills for British households. 

Full Text 
America isn't the only place where anticarbon politics is taking a welcome beating. Last week Polish Environment Minister Marcin Korolec vetoed the next step in the EU's plan to reduce its CO2 by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. If the generation of Europeans now being born means to live in a modern society, it'll have Mr. Korolec to thank. 
Among other goals, the European Commission would all-but ban electricity from fossil fuels, which currently make up about 50% of total EU electrical generation. Poland, which generates more than 90% of its electricity from coal, would be hit especially hard. "We need to look for solutions we'll actually be able to implement," Mr. Korolec noted dryly. 
The Commission is now working to cobble together a new draft of the cuts, though Warsaw has indicated it won't sign onto any new carbon restrictions until the rest of the world does. Meantime, Warsaw is getting leaned on. "The outcome shows how we must redouble our efforts in explaining to Poland that shifting to a low-carbon economy is part of long-term growth in Europe," tut-tutted U.K. Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey. 
That could take a lot of explaining. The EU has already committed to cut 20% from the 1990 baselineby 2020. Last year Mr. Davey's government poured GBP 1.4 billion into wind and other "renewable" energy sources and mandated utilities to use them, the most noticeable result of which is soaring electricity bills for British households. 
In Germany -- where greens are fighting Poland's moves to build a (low-carbon) nuclear plant and drill for shale gas next door -- prices are also rising sharply. The state's Dena Energy Agency estimated in December that household electricity bills could rise 20% by 2020 if Germany proceeds with its current plans to de-carbonize and de-nuclearize. 
Mr. Korolec says he's drawing support among other former Eastern bloc countries, though so far only Warsaw has stuck its neck out. The better news is that even Britain is pushing for one of Mr. Korolec's ideas, which is that any new carbon-cutting targets should be "technology neutral" and leave the door open for nuclear power. Maybe Mr. Davey has awakened to the fact that Europeans will still want electricity in 2050.

Full Text 
LONDON -- U.K. Energy Secretary Chris Huhne resigned Friday to fight a criminal charge that he misled authorities about an alleged driving offense, forcing Prime Minister David Cameron to replace a third minister in his coalition government. 
Keir Starmer, the public prosecutor for England and Wales, said Mr. Huhne, a senior member of the smaller coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, will face charges over allegations his then wife accepted a penalty on his behalf for driving above the speed limit in 2003. 
"I'm innocent of these charges and I intend to fight this in the courts, and I'm confident that a jury will agree," Mr. Huhne said in a brief statement to reporters. "So as to avoid any distraction to either my official duties or my trial defense, I am standing down, resigning as energy and climate-change secretary." 
His ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, an economist who has worked in government and the private sector, will face the same charge of perverting the course of justice. Sentencing for the general offense is at the discretion of a judge and can range from a fine to a prison term in serious cases, the U.K. Sentencing Council said. 
Mr. Cameron said he believed Mr. Huhne had made the right decision and wished him well in the future. 
Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he hoped Mr. Huhne would clear his name and return to a key role in government as soon as possible. 
The government appointed Ed Davey, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker working as minister for employment relations, consumer and postal affairs, to succeed Mr. Huhne. The prime minister's spokesman said there shouldn't be a significant shift in direction at the energy department. 
The ministerial change isn't expected to have any impact on coalition's economic policy or threaten its balance. But Liberal Democrats may miss Mr. Huhne, a forceful party member who played a role in the formation of the coalition in 2010. 
The resignation comes at a challenging time for the energy sector. About a quarter of the U.K.'s electricity-generating capacity is shutting down over the next decade as old coal and nuclear plants close. More than GBP 110 billion ($174 billion) investment is required through 2020 to replace that capacity with low-carbon energy and to upgrade the grid. 
"It's not a good time to be losing an energy minister," said Dominic Nash, an analyst at Liberum Capital. "It's getting toward a real crunchtime -- power stations are going to start closing in 2016-17 and unless the market improves the supply security is going to get a bit shakier."

Abstract 
Oil, in Mr. Obama's world, is a "Republican" interest group; anything that's good for the oil industry is bad for the alternate power structure he's been trying to build with handouts and mandates for green energy. Mr. Obama's relationship with global warming may indeed be perfunctory, but he understands the necessity of shibboleths to rationalize and justify the "investments" he's dishing out to manufacture a support base whose need for subsidies and regulatory favors jibes with the Democratic Party's need for donations. 

Full Text 
Barack Obama may believe a lot of things, but he probably doesn't believe the Sierra Club is key to his re-election. His decision to nix the Keystone XL pipeline will cost him votes but he did it anyway. 
We'll admit that Mr. Obama's global warming talk has often seemed to us perfunctory. Perhaps we mistook his lack of heat for a lack of conviction. He just released his first 2012 campaign ad and it's a paean to green energy. Maybe he's no less a believer than Al Gore, for all the problems this might seem to pose for what we thought we knew about our president. 
For one thing, he's not given to unrealistic goals. He knows China and India are opening a new coal plant every week. He knows the huge amounts of fossil energy lying at humanity's feet won't be abandoned just because an American president says so. He can't fail to notice that Canada's oil sands won't remain undeveloped; the oil will go to the Far East. 
Mr. Obama also seems enough of a free thinker to entertain the possibility at least that global warming theory may be wrong. In a telling exchange with interviewer Charlie Rose a few years ago, Al Gore was asked to describe the evidence of man's role in climate change. Each time Mr. Gore recurred to some version of a "consensus of scientists" or "the most respected scientists whose judgment I think is the best." 
The truth is, the theory may be popular, but the evidence has thus far eluded the tens of billions spent on climate science. The temperature data are so noisy that they reveal no pattern connecting rising CO2 in the industrial age with temperature trends. Some say because CO2 is a "greenhouse" gas, shut up, case closed. But the known relationship between carbon and climate doesn't actually indicate a big reason to worry. 
To produce worrisome scenarios, climate models must posit "feedbacks" that magnify the impact of CO2 by 300% to 500%. A cynic notices that these models became especially popular in the '90s, when measured warming exceeded what could be attributed to CO2, so new fudge was needed to preserve CO2 as the culprit. 
Mr. Gore is not smart (no matter what the Nobel committee thinks) whereas Mr. Obama is smart and all these things have likely occurred to him. But he's also a political operator and an acolyte of radical theorist Saul Alinksy. He understands politics as a matter of power, and democratic politics as a matter of powerful coalitions cultivated and maintained with self-interest (aka money, money, money). 
Oil, in Mr. Obama's world, is a "Republican" interest group; anything that's good for the oil industry is bad for the alternate power structure he's been trying to build with handouts and mandates for green energy. 
Mr. Obama's relationship with global warming may indeed be perfunctory, but he understands the necessity of shibboleths to rationalize and justify the "investments" he's dishing out to manufacture a support base whose need for subsidies and regulatory favors jibes with the Democratic Party's need for donations. Oil sands are the "dirtiest" fossil energy, requiring great releases of CO2. To approve Keystone, then, not only would undermine his side's crucial shibboleths. It would compromise his own credibility as a leader who can be trusted to deny advantage to "Republican" industries and deliver it to "Democratic" ones. 
Not for nothing did Canadian Resources Minister Joe Oliver, after Mr. Obama's Keystone decision, gripe about the influence of "billionaire socialists from the United States." Not for nothing did Mr. Obama's own supporters crow about Mr. Obama's ruling as a triumph over the industrialist Koch brothers, an allusion to whom even opens the new Obama campaign spot. 
Presidents make traps for themselves: Signature initiatives cannot fail; they can only be doubled down on, as Mr. Obama was expected to do in Tuesday's State of the Union even as he also tried to make peace with the natural-gas fracking boom. Only fresh waves of rhetoric praising electric cars will suffice when taxpayers are figuring out that Obama policy has them subsidizing electric playthings for the affluent. Solyndra must be defended all the more fiercely now that solar is collapsing globally as countries repent of foolish subsidies. Green energy must be hugged to Mr. Obama's breast all the more tightly as the shale revolution renders hopeless any chance of wind and solar becoming cost-competitive with fossil fuels. 
Mr. Obama is engaged in a "long game," says Andrew Sullivan, writing in Newsweek, making a point that no one doubted. But there's a difference between playing the long game and playing it well. The Obama long game is exactly how green energy metamorphosed from a policy notion into a political strategy and then into a dead weight his campaign must lug to November. 
Still, let us admire the high-rolling political risk Mr. Obama takes in spurning affordable, strategically convenient energy from Canada. That risk includes, between now and Election Day, looking like a chump if oil prices surge because of the world's vulnerability to the narrowness of the Strait of Hormuz.

Abstract 
The so-called utility rule requires power plants to install "maximum achievable control technology" to reduce mercury emissions and other trace gases. 

Full Text 
At an unusual gala ceremony on the release of a major new Environmental Protection Agency rule yesterday, chief Lisa Jackson called it "historic" and "a great victory." And she's right: The rule may be the most expensive the agency has ever issued, and it represents the triumph of the Obama Administration's green agenda over economic growth and job creation. Congratulations. 
The so-called utility rule requires power plants to install "maximum achievable control technology" to reduce mercury emissions and other trace gases. But the true goal of the rule's 1,117 pages is to harm coal-fired power plants and force large parts of the fleet -- the U.S. power system workhorse -- to shut down in the name of climate change. The EPA figures the rule will cost $9.6 billion, which is a gross, deliberate underestimate. 
In return Ms. Jackson says the public will get billions of dollars of health benefits like less asthma if not a cure for cancer. Those credulous enough to believe her should understand that the total benefits of mercury reduction amount to all of $6 million. That's total present value, not benefits per year -- oh, and that's an -illion with an "m," which is not normally how things work out in President Obama's Washington. 
The rest of the purported benefits -- to be precise, 99.99% -- come by double-counting pollution reductions like soot that the EPA regulates through separate programs and therefore most will happen anyway. Using such "co-benefits" is an abuse of the cost-benefit process and shows that Cass Sunstein's team at the White House regulatory office -­many of whom opposed the rule -- got steamrolled. 
As baseload coal power is retired or idled, the reliability of the electrical grid will be compromised, as every neutral analyst expects. Some utilities like Calpine Corp. and PSEG have claimed in these pages that the reliability concerns are overblown, but the Alfred E. Newman crowd has a vested interest in profiting from the higher wholesale electricity clearing prices that the EPA wants to cause. 
Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is charged with protecting reliability, abnegated its statutory responsibilities as the rule was being written. 
One FERC economist wrote in a March email that "I don't think there is any value in continuing to engage EPA on the issues. EPA has indicated that these are their assumptions and have made it clear that are not changed [sic] anything on reliability . . . [EPA] does not directly answer anything associated with local reliability." The EPA repeatedly told Congress that it had "very frequent substantive contact and consultation with FERC." 
The EPA also took the extraordinary step of issuing a pre-emptive "enforcement memorandum," which is typically issued only after the EPA determines its rules are being broken. The memo tells utilities that they must admit to violating clean air laws if they can't retrofit their plants within the EPA's timeframe at any cost or if shutting down a plant will lead to regional blackouts. Such legal admissions force companies into a de facto EPA receivership and expose them to lawsuits and other liabilities. 
The economic harm here is vast, and the utility rule saga -- from the EPA's reckless endangerment to the White House's failure to temper Ms. Jackson -- has been a disgrace.

Abstract 
According to the report, "the nation's power grid will be stressed in ways never before experienced" and reliability depends on building new power plants to cover the losses. 

Full Text 
Say what you will about Obama Administration regulators, their problem has rarely been a failure to regulate. Which makes the abdication of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission especially notable -- and dangerous for the U.S. power supply. 
Last week FERC convened a conference on the wave of new Environmental Protection Agency rules that are designed to force dozens of coal-fired power plants to shut down. The meeting barely fulfilled the commission's legal obligations, but despite warnings from expert after expert, including some of its own, the FERC Commissioners refuse to do anything about this looming threat to electric reliability. 
The latest body to sound the EPA alarm is the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which last Tuesday released its exhaustive annual 10-year projections. "Environmental regulations are shown to be the number one risk to reliability over the next one to five years," the report explains. 
NERC's forecasts are the gold standard for the U.S. power system because they are built from the bottom up, starting with finely grained data from individual plants. NERC has been doing this work since 1967, and since 2005 it has operated under the FERC umbrella as an "electric reliability organization" similar to Finra, the securities regulator with quasi-governmental duties. 
The threat is that the EPA is triggering what NERC calls "an unprecedented resource-mix change," with utilities switching to natural gas from coal. For the first time in U.S. history, net coal capacity is in decline. On top of the 38 gigawatts of generation that is already being run below normal levels or slated for early retirement, NERC predicts another 36 to 59 gigawatts will come offline by 2018, depending on the "scope and timing" of EPA demands. That could mean nearly a quarter of all coal-fired capacity. 
According to the report, "the nation's power grid will be stressed in ways never before experienced" and reliability depends on building new power plants to cover the losses. But the electric industry has only three years to comply under one EPA regulation known as the utility rule that is meant to target mercury and is due to be finalized soon, while many other destructive rules are in the works. 
Replacing power is not like replacing a lost cellphone. There are bottlenecks in permitting, engineering, financing and building a new plant and then tying it to the electricity network. Over this same three-year window, NERC estimates that between 576 and 677 plants will need to be temporarily shut down to install retrofits like scrubbers or baghouses. 
All of this has been obvious to anyone paying attention. In its draft utility rule the EPA itself warned that "sources integral to reliable operation" may be forced to shut down, before it sanitized these concessions from the final proposal. Twenty-seven states say their regional reliability is at risk, concerns echoed by FBR Capital, Credit Suisse, Fitch, Bernstein Research and several grid operators. FERC's own Office of Electric Reliability produced an alarming study, before its work was disowned by Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, as we reported in the September 26 editorial "Inside the EPA." 
Southern Co., the utility that covers states from Mississippi to Georgia, says the EPA's timeline can't be met "at any cost" and that in its region "reliability cannot be maintained without load shedding" -- that is, rationing power to large industrial consumers. American Electric Power, which operates in 11 Midwest states, says that option may be a "last resort" as well. This is the kind of political overhang that harms economic growth. 
Keep in mind that the EPA estimates that the benefits to society from the mercury reductions in the utility rule max out at $6.1 million, total, while imposing $11 billion in compliance costs annually. That is a crazy tradeoff even if it didn't endanger the electric grid. 
The best option would be to kill the utility rule and put the EPA on probation, but second best is a longer phase-in to give utilities more time to comply. FERC could do some practical good by formally issuing a "215 finding" that the EPA utility rule endangers reliability. Or the White House budget and regulatory office could require the EPA to repropose the rule with more flexibility. Or President Obama could declare that the rule endangers national security. Or Congress could block the rule, though that would take more fortitude than Senate Democrats have shown so far. 
None of this is likely to happen because it would interfere with the larger Administration priority to kill as much coal power as rapidly as possible to serve the global warming agenda. But when the brownouts and cost-spikes occur, don't blame the utilities. Blame their regulator.

Abstract 
By 2030, it aims to lift renewables to 8% of energy output, up from less than 1% now.The focus on renewable energy in South Africa comes as state power company Eskom Holdings Ltd. struggles to finance the expansion of its coal-power stations on its own. 

Full Text 
South Africa on Wednesday will unveil a shortlist of companies eligible for a $12 billion package of solar, wind and biomass projects -- pitting Chinese, Indian, American and European rivals against each other for a piece of one of the world's largest renewable energy deals. 
On the sidelines of the climate talks taking place in Durban, South Africa, hopeful solar and wind power manufacturers from around the world this week clustered in a tent around the department of energy booth, battling heat and humidity. The energy companies each had their own booths inside the tent, which experienced occasional power outages. 
Officials from California-based SunPower Corp. rubbed shoulders with representatives from French solar panel maker Tenesol SA. Both companies are among those awaiting Wednesday's announcement. 
The government is expected to winnow some 54 bids down to about 14. Those selected will be asked by June to submit final financial and environmental plans before a decision is made on construction for projects that would generate an estimated 3,725 megawatts of energy, according to executives involved in this process. 
South Africa's government will follow this first phase with four more rounds over the next two years, as officials solicit proposals for new wind, solar and biomass projects. 
South Africa represents a new frontier for a struggling industry -- and a possible gateway into an even larger continental market. Those prospects have sparked intense competition between low-cost Chinese and Indian manufacturers and their beleaguered competitors from the U.S. and Europe. 
In the mix for the current phase of projects are China's top two biggest wind turbine makers, Sinovel Wind Co. Ltd. and Goldwind Science & Technology Co., as well as the Indian company Suzlon Energy Ltd., which has been a low-cost pioneer in wind farm-generated energy. Europe's biggest wind-turbine manufacturer, Vestas Wind Systems A/S, is also aiming for a piece of the contract. "There's a growing energy demand here and they need more supply. South Africa has set a clear renewable target," said Vestas spokesman Andrew Hilton. 
South Africa is the continent's largest economy, but it is struggling to meet power demand from industry and residents. About 90% of the country's electricity come from coal-fired power plants -- an affordable source of energy but one that's viewed as less clean and sustainable than wind and solar. 
South Africa now wants to supplement its energy mix. By 2030, it aims to lift renewables to 8% of energy output, up from less than 1% now.The focus on renewable energy in South Africa comes as state power company Eskom Holdings Ltd. struggles to finance the expansion of its coal-power stations on its own. 
Bids for the renewable energy projects coincide with the global climate meetings, where the South African hosts say they want to reduce carbon emissions by 34% by 2020. South Africa is the 12th largest carbon emitter globally. 
Renewable energy companies are seeking new markets amid sluggish demand in the U.S. and Europe. South Africa's neighbors, Namibia and Mozambique, are also trying to boost production of wind and solar power through various credit programs. 
The Chinese have ramped up manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels, leading to global oversupply and prompting criticism from competitors in developed economies. 
In the U.S., seven solar-panel manufacturers recently filed an antidumping suit against Chinese rivals, accusing them of selling their products below the cost of production. 
The Chinese climate-change representative in Durban said this week he thinks the subsidies that Beijing gives to China's renewable energy companies spur that sector's development, and complaints should be taken up at the World Trade Organization.

Concerns about climate change are pushing power companies to switch from coal and oil to cleaner-burning gas in electricity generation, and its potential as a transport fuel is also being widely explored.

The east coast of Africa confirmed its place as one of the brightest spots on the global energy landscape after Anadarko Petroleum Corp. sharply raised its estimate for the 
amount of natural gas contained in a big field it has found off the coast of Mozambique. 
Anadarko's chief executive, James Hackett, said the revised estimate increased the company's confidence that "this could be one of the most important natural-gas fields 
discovered in the last 10 years." 

Anadarko said it had increased the estimate of recoverable resources from the four discoveries made in its Offshore Area 1 block to between 15 trillion and 30 trillion cubic feet 

of gas. 
Initially, the Texas-based company had said the field contained six trillion cubic feet, a figure it raised to 10 trillion cubic feet in October. Thirty trillion cubic feet would be 
enough to meet an entire year's gas consumption by the U.S. 

Anadarko, whose partners in the block include Dublin-based Cove Energy PLC and Japan's Mitsui & Co., is the field's operator, with a 36.5% interest. 

"I'm convinced that in 10 years' time, Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya will together form a major gas hub for Asian and Far Eastern markets," said John Craven, CEO of Cove 
Energy, in an interview. 
The announcement came just a month after Eni SpA, the Italian energy giant, disclosed it had found 22.5 trillion cubic feet of gas off Mozambique's coast -- the biggest such 

exploration discovery in the company's history. 

Such large resources appear big enough to sustain the construction of a large liquefied-natural-gas, or LNG, plant in Mozambique, catapulting the impoverished former 
Portuguese colony into the world's major league of gas exporters. 
The discoveries come at a time when the importance of natural gas in the global energy balance is rising. 
Concerns about climate change are pushing power companies to switch from coal and oil to cleaner-burning gas in electricity generation, and its potential as a transport fuel is 

also being widely explored. 
The global oil majors have long produced oil in West Africa, in countries like Angola and Nigeria, which together pump about 4.2 million barrels of crude a day. 
But they are increasingly turning eastward, drawn particularly to the deep waters off Africa's eastern and southeastern coast. 
Tullow Oil PLC has been a leader, finding huge quantities of oil in Uganda's Lake Albert rift basin. Total SA of France and China's Cnooc Ltd. are also partners in the project. 
Total recently acquired the license to a heavy-oil field in Madagascar. 
Meanwhile the gas-rich waters offshore Tanzania have recently attracted a number of big players, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Statoil ASA of Norway and BG Group PLC, which 

is also exploring off Kenya. Credit: By Guy Chazan

Full Text 
To win election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Mitt Romney made a truce with liberal activists and cast himself as a moderating force within the Republican Party. If he becomes the GOP nominee for president, it may be because of steps he took to change those alliances during a few months of 2005. 
Mr. Romney had once said he didn't "line up" with the National Rifle Association, but in May 2005 proclaimed "The Right to Bear Arms Day." He had rejected the label of either pro-choice or pro-life, according to an abortion-rights activist, but in July 2005 wrote: "I am prolife." He helped lead talks on a pact to control emissions but in December 2005 surprised some staff members by pulling out. 
A "flip-flopper" tag has long dogged Mr. Romney. Less known is that his reputation as ideologically elastic was cemented over a 10-month stretch in the second half of his term as governor. Conservative interest groups that had once received a cold shoulder were extended a glad hand, while liberal groups often got iced out. 
To people who served in his administration, 2005 was the year his mission changed. For the two previous years, the problem-solving, ideologically ambiguous governor was tackling the issues of a state in deficit, clogged with infrastructure problems and sprawl, and struggling with the uninsured. 
Then Mr. Romney began to emerge as a national Republican figure, with larger ambitions. As he did so, he faced the same problem encountered by other socially moderate, fiscally conservative Republicans from Democratic-dominated states as they tried to slide into a more conservative national Republican party. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, New York Gov. George Pataki and New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani all had similar discomfort in making the transition, and didn't get as far in doing so as Mr. Romney has. 
"You have to understand, Mitt Romney is very pragmatic, and I think what happened was the issue became, 'How do I win the presidency of United States?'" said Rob Garrity, a Republican environmentalist and Romney supporter who served in his administration. "Positions changed." 
His repositioning prepared him to be a plausible candidate for the GOP beyond liberal-leaning Massachusetts, while showing him ideologically nimble enough to still appeal to voters in the political center. It is that appeal that supporters say makes him the most electable of the Republican contenders. 
Mr. Romney's campaign declined to comment for this article. But the candidate addressed the issue at a Republican debate Wednesday evening, vigorously asserting that his core convictions have remained solid. 
"I think people understand that I'm a man of steadiness and constancy," Mr. Romney said. "I don't think you're going to find somebody who has more of those attributes than I do." 
He also said he had to adjust as governor of Massachusetts because 85% of its legislators were Democrats: "To get anything done, I was always in an away game, if you will." 
Changes of positions are hardly unique to Mr. Romney, and he isn't the only one running for president who has to wrestle with shifts in policy or tone. President Barack Obama campaigned in 2008 against a mandate that everyone must buy health insurance, saying it should be limited to the purchase of health coverage for children. He switched as the health bill wound its way through Congress, and now the mandate is the center of political and legal battles over the health-care law. 
Hillary Clinton established her reputation as an activist liberal when she was First Lady. After she was elected to the Senate, she set out to re-establish herself as a political moderate ahead of her own White House run. 
Republican candidate Herman Cain has offered shifting explanations of his position on abortion. Rick Perry has retreated from a position he took as Texas governor that the state should order girls to be vaccinated against the HPV pathogen. 
All have been criticized from within their own party for such moves, and, like Mr. Romney, often attribute the shifts to changing circumstances or argue the moves are alterations of tone more than substance. 
Mr. Romney adopted a number of liberal positions in 1994 while trying to unseat the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy. He supported abortion rights -- "you will not see me wavering on that,"" Mr. Romney said. He backed legal protections for gays and lesbians, although not gay marriage. For gun purchases, he supported a waiting period and background checks. It was in 1994 that he said he didn't line up with the N.R.A. 
He lost his Senate run. Eight years later, after he had been elected governor, some activists for conservative causes still viewed Mr. Romney as an unfriendly force. 
A gun-rights lobbyist, Jim Wallace, found himself battling the governor over firearms fees and hunters' priorities. A low point for Mr. Wallace came one day in July 2004 when Gov. Romney was set to sign a bill that banned assault weapons but that also had some provisions gun-rights groups liked. Mr. Wallace had an invitation to speak at the signing ceremony. 
At the last minute, a gun-control activist, Jon Rosenthal, got an invitation too. Not only that, but as Mr. Rosenthal rushed into the news conference, he says he saw Romney aides pulling up the name tags taped to the floor that showed where each guest was to stand -- tearing up the paper with Mr. Wallace's name and replacing it with one bearing his own name. The gun-control advocate was placed close to the governor and got the speaking slot that Mr. Wallace, the gun-rights lobbyist, had expected. 
Yet in the following year, 2005, both sides on the gun issue noticed a change. 
In May of that year, Mr. Romney declared a "Right to Bear Arms Day." Mr. Wallace's group, the Gun Owners' Action League, began having nearly monthly meetings with the 
governor's top aides, he says. 
Mr. Romney signed legislation cutting some red tape detested by gun owners in November 2005, and less than a year later he became a lifetime member of the N.R.A. 
Mr. Romney as governor pressed forward with a health-care law that he saw as his legacy, a market-driven approach that was in vogue with many conservative thinkers at the 

time. Now, it appears he may have miscalculated: The Massachusetts health-care law remains a major burden on his quest for the Republican nomination. 
Mr. Romney met with abortion-rights activists while running for governor in 2002. He assured them he would protect women's right to choose abortion and said he would 

neither expand nor restrict such a right as governor, according to Nicole Roos, chairwoman of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts' political-action committee. She adds that he 
said he didn't wish to be called "pro-choice" and didn't like the "pro-life" label, either. 
A leading abortion foe, Anne Fox of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, says she didn't even bother to reach out to Mr. Romney during the 2002 campaign, presuming that he was 

no ally. 

Both groups found a change in 2005. In July of that year, Mr. Romney vetoed legislation that would have widened access to the Plan B emergency-contraceptive pill, by requiring 
hospitals to offer it to all rape victims and allowing some state-approved pharmacists to sell it without prescription. 
To Mr. Romney, this was a principled decision consistent with his pledge not to change Massachusetts law relating to abortion. 
Ms. Roos of NARAL says that although Mr. Romney had made such a pledge orally, he had stated in the group's written questionnaire that he supported efforts to expand access 

to emergency contraception. 

The day after the veto, Mr. Romney wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed piece that his convictions on the issue had "evolved," and declared "I am prolife" -- embracing a label Ms. 
Roos says he had avoided as a candidate in 2002. 
Ms. Fox of Citizens for Life says her antiabortion group began having regular contact with a Romney aide and through him asked if Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, would become an 

honorary chairwoman of its new capital campaign. She did so. 

Similar to abortion-rights activists, gay groups came away from Mr. Romney's 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor believing that he would be a friend at the head of 
state government -- that while he might not cheer advances in gay rights, he wouldn't impede them either, says Laura Kiritsy, a former reporter at a gay newspaper. 
Mr. Romney never embraced gay marriage or even a brand of civil unions implemented by neighboring Vermont. But he spoke at length about his support for domestic-

partnership rights and protections against workplace discrimination. 
In 2005, Mr. Romney veered away from such overtures. 
The state's highest court had legalized gay marriage in 2003. Mr. Romney criticized the ruling at the time. In 2005 he went further, taking his views on the road by denouncing 

the decision in several out-of-state speeches. 
"Today, same-sex couples are marrying under the law in Massachusetts," Mr. Romney told South Carolina Republicans. "Some are actually having children born to them." 
He came home to protests by Massachusetts gay activists he had once courted. "To have the governor out there beating that . . . drum, it was definitely hurtful," says Ms. 

Kiritsy, who manages education efforts for a Boston organization called Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders. 
Not all groups saw his position on gay rights in 2005 as any different from before. Kris Mineau, president of the socially conservative Massachusetts Family Institute, says his 

group's intensive dealings with the governor began in late 2003, after the state high court's backing of gay marriage. Mr. Mineau calls this an issue on which Mr. Romney "never 
for a single moment flinched on or debated." 
The governor's final policy adjustment came at the end of 2005. 
Just after he took office, in 2003, he had attended a news conference at Salem Harbor, Mass., vowing to close an aged coal-fired power plant and declaring: "That plant kills 

people." His administration went to work on what would become the nation's first regulations on the emission of carbon dioxide, and helped launch negotiations on a Northeast 

regional compact to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Environmentalists had good reason to believe the governor was with them. On Nov. 7, 2005, Mr. Romney hailed the proposed nine-state climate-change agreement as "good 
business" that would spur investment in renewable energy while having only moderate effects on energy bills. 

Alarm bells began clanging in the business community, says Robert Ruddock, who headed government affairs for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, or AIM, a business 

group. The state had some of the highest electricity rates in the Northeast; businesses didn't want them to go higher still. 
Business groups such as AIM had been kept at arm's length during negotiations on the emissions compact, accorded "observer" status rather than being declared direct 
stakeholders. Now, the group jumped into action. "We started to make the calls to the higher echelon. We felt that our views were not getting through," Mr. Ruddock says. 

He and another AIM official demanded meetings with Mr. Romney's secretary of economic development, Ranch Kimball, and through him they secured four meetings with other administration officials. 
On Dec. 14, 2005, Mr. Romney pulled Massachusetts out the negotiations for a regional emissions compact. 
He said he did so because he had failed to secure a cap on the amount that power-plant operators would have to pay to emit gases thought to warm the planet. "We offered a 
simple safety valve, and they rejected that," Mr. Romney told the Boston Globe. 

His economic-development secretary, Mr. Kimball, says that despite Mr. Romney's prior warm words about the pact, he had always been pressing the issue of its economic 

consequences. Another state's negotiator confirms that. 
In any case, the day after he pulled out of climate-change negotiations, Mr. Romney announced that he wouldn't seek a second term as Massachusetts governor. The 
implication, later confirmed, was that he was going to seek the Republican nomination for the presidency instead. 

More than one politician has taken stands that evolved. 
Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860 favoring an incremental "compensated emancipation" approach, rather than declaring emancipation as he did in 1863. 
Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on the slogan "He kept us out of war," but on April 2, 1917, asked lawmakers to declare war on Germany. 
George H.W. Bush as a candidate declared "Read my lips -- no new taxes," but in 1990 signed a budget deal that raised some existing taxes. 
Bill Clinton proposed a middle-class tax cut in 1992, but before inauguration said, "I have to put everything back on the table," because of deficit projections. 
John McCain voted against President George W. Bush's tax cuts, then ran for president in 2008 as supporter of them. 
Barack Obama said in '08 a mandate to have health insurance ought not to apply to everyone, but switched as the health bill wound its way through Congress.

Abstract 
An increase of this size would have severe consequences, including a sea level rise of as much as six feet -- causing dislocation of human settlements -- and drought, floods and heat waves that would severely affect food production, rates of disease and mortality, the IEA said. 

Full Text 
LONDON -- Dangerous climate change will be essentially irreversible within a little over five years, the International Energy Agency said in an annual report urging governments 
to do what they can to prevent that outcome. 
To prevent long-term average global temperatures rising more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels -- seen by many scientists as the 
maximum increase without serious climate disruption -- drastic changes to energy and industrial policies are needed, the IEA said in its World Energy Outlook. 

Such a shift looks unlikely given current global economic problems and the move away from low-carbon nuclear power in some countries after the recent nuclear disaster in 

Japan, the IEA said. Promises to invest to curb carbon dioxide emissions have in many cases failed to acquire legislative urgency. 
The report also highlights the challenge posed by the rapidly rising use in emerging economies of fossil fuels, particularly coal, that many scientists believe are a key contributor 
to climate change. 

"The door to reach two degrees is about to close. In 2017 it will be closed forever," Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist, said in an interview. 
Carbon-dioxide emissions in 2010 grew by an "almost unprecedented" 5.3% to 30.4 billion metric tons (33.5 tons), the IEA said in the report. 
"Coal was the biggest source of emissions growth in 2010, primarily driven by use in China and India," it said. This increase capped a decade of booming use of coal, the most 

readily available fuel in emerging economies, even as concern about climate change grew, the IEA said. 
China and India have participated in climate-change negotiations, but have not made binding commitments to curb emissions. 
On the world's current trajectory, the long-term increase in average global temperatures will exceed six degrees Celsius, the IEA said, without specifying when it projected that 

forecast to arrive. 

Even if all countries follow through on promises they have already made to curb emissions and invest in clean energy, many of which are threatened by the current economic distress, temperatures will rise by 3.5 degrees Celsius, it said. An increase of this size would have severe consequences, including a sea level rise of as much as six feet -- causing dislocation of human settlements -- and drought, floods and 
heat waves that would severely affect food production, rates of disease and mortality, the IEA said. 
The IEA uses conclusions from research collated by the United Nations. Most climate scientists agree with the U.N. conclusions, although recent polls show a growing proportion of the public in many countries is skeptical of climate change. Credit: By James Herron

Abstract 
Mr. Romney's most recent statement marked a sharp swing away from his early position as governor of Massachusetts, when he implemented rules on coal-burning power plants that he touted as the first in the country to target gases thought to cause global warming. 

Full Text 
Rivals of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Friday repeated their accusations of flip-flopping on core issues, after he told an audience on Thursday that he didn't know what caused global warming. 
Mr. Romney said earlier this year that human activity played a role. 
"Mitt Romney's positions change, often dramatically, depending on the audience or location," said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, also a GOP candidate. "Voters need to consider the fact that Romney, in one week, changed positions on man-made global warming, capping carbon emissions and Ohio's efforts to curb union powers." 
Appearing on CNN, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. said, "You can't be a perfectly lubricated weather vane on the important issues of the day." 
Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul called the accusations "ridiculous," saying, "Gov. Romney's view on climate change has not changed. He believes it's occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn't know to what extent." Taking a swipe at Mr. Perry, she added, "Maybe the bigger threat is all the hot air coming from career politicians who are desperate to hold on to power." 
Speaking to voters in Pittsburgh on Thursday, Mr. Romney said, "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." 
Earlier this year, Mr. Romney said in New Hampshire, "I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And, No. 2, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much. . . . And so I think it's important to us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases." 
Mr. Romney's most recent statement marked a sharp swing away from his early position as governor of Massachusetts, when he implemented rules on coal-burning power plants that he touted as the first in the country to target gases thought to cause global warming. 
The Pittsburgh comments came the same week Mr. Romney created confusion over his views of an Ohio law, backed by Republican Gov. John Kasich, that limits collective-bargaining rights for public employees. Mr. Romney had visited a Republican phone bank in Cincinnati where volunteers were asking voters to support the law in a referendum. Mr. Romney told reporters he didn't know enough about the ballot initiative to comment, even though he had lent his support to the law on his Facebook page. On Wednesday, he revised his remarks, saying he backed Mr. Kasich "110%." 
Climate change is a sensitive issue for Mr. Romney. Days after winning the governorship in 2002, he invited one of New England's most prominent environmental lawyers, Douglas Foy, into his administration as a "super-secretary." Mr. Foy was put in charge of negotiating a nine-state pact to cap emissions of gases in the Northeast and require businesses to trade credits to emit those gases. Mr. Romney signaled he would sign on to the pact but ultimately opted out, after failing to win caps on the price businesses would pay for emissions credits. 
Mr. Perry has challenged the idea of a human role in climate change and said "there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data." Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has called studies attesting to man-made global warming "manufactured science." Newt Gingrich, who once made an advertisement with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling for a bipartisan response to climate change, said this summer the ad had been "misconstrued" and that he was merely trying to foster debate.

Abstract 
The decade has seen filmmakers like Michael Moore ("Bowling for Columbine"), Errol Morris ("The Fog of War"), Alex Gibney ("Taxi to the Dark Side"), Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"), Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth") and Charles Ferguson ("Inside Job") take the documentary to the multiplex by focusing on hot topics that sell tickets and make buzz in a 24-hour news cycle.

New York has plenty of places to see new documentaries, from major institutions like the Museum of Modern Art to plucky nonprofits like Brooklyn's Union Docs. And it certainly has plenty of film festivals. But until last year, one thing the city didn't have was a festival dedicated solely to documentary films. 
Now there's DOC NYC, which is, according to programmer Thom Powers, "the largest documentary festival of its kind ever held in New York." Opening Wednesday at the IFC Center and New York University, the nine-day event boasts 52 features, 45 shorts and 15 panels, making it one of the city's biggest cinematic events, period. 
Conceived in 2010 by John Vanco, vice president and general manager of IFC Center, DOC NYC has already expanded by two days and twice the selections, taking full advantage of an ongoing boom in the field. 
"There's a tremendous proliferation that we're seeing of these films," said Mr. Powers, who programs the IFC Center's weekly Stranger Than Fiction series with partner Raphaela Neihausen, and also serves as curator for documentaries at the Toronto International Film Festival. "You've seen a 180-degree turn in the last 10 years. You have documentaries playing as in-flight entertainment and offered on digital distribution systems like Netflix as a significant category. I think we've educated an audience in the last 10 years." 
The decade has seen filmmakers like Michael Moore ("Bowling for Columbine"), Errol Morris ("The Fog of War"), Alex Gibney ("Taxi to the Dark Side"), Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"), Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth") and Charles Ferguson ("Inside Job") take the documentary to the multiplex by focusing on hot topics that sell tickets and make buzz in a 24-hour news cycle. 
Barbara Kopple, who won Academy Awards in 1977 and 1991 for her nonfiction films about striking coal miners ("Harlan County USA") and food-plant employees ("American Dream"), respectively, suggested that the form has also benefited from a change in public perception. "People really want to see things that say something, and now they're used to it," said the filmmaker, who will screen the portrait "A Force of Nature + Conversation with Ellen Ratner" at DOC NYC. "We're in the game, which is really nice." 
DOC NYC has its share of major names, among them: Werner Herzog, who will present his harrowing opening-night selection, "Into the Abyss," a philosophical exploration of a Texas triple-homicide case; Charlotte Rampling, the subject of "Charlotte Rampling: The Look," a candid portrait of the glamorous British actress; and former heavyweight champion Joe Frazier, who will be on hand for "Joe Frazier: When the Smoke Clears." 
But, as Mr. Powers stressed, the festival is more about discoveries and, in many cases, breaking news. He pointed to "Scenes of a Crime," a prize-winner at the Durham, N.C.­based Full Frame festival, which questions a murder conviction in the death of an infant in Troy, N.Y. There's also the festival's spotlight selection, "The Island President," John Shenk's portrait of Mohamed Nasheed, who pushed aside a dictatorship to become the democratic leader of the Maldives. Mr. Shenk tracks the unconventional president as he fights to save his archipelago homeland from the catastrophic effects of climate change. 
Mr. Shenk said he is encouraged that documentaries no longer have to be market phenomenons to reach wide audiences. "In the early 1990s, you had movies like 'Hoop Dreams' and 'The War Room,'" he said. "But now you have this independent media stream: documentary festivals, PBS, HBO, Sundance. There's this loose affiliation that's maybe taking the place of what the TV networks did in the 1950s and '60s, or the newsreels that ran in front of films way back. The tools have never been better to make your films look good for cheaper." 
The filmmaker said he lobbied hard to convince Mr. Nasheed to let him spend a year hovering like a proverbial fly on the wall. At one point, the president, who was imprisoned and tortured by the previous regime, recognized that they shared a certain tenacity against difficult odds. "He said, 'John, what you are trying to do is impossible.'" 
The overwhelming evidence of DOC NYC is that it's actually more possible than ever. "It really gives me hope," Mr. Shenk said. "There's people out there who are willing to pick up a camera and make stories about what they think is important, and they don't have to take direction from executives."

Abstract 
Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech government's special energy envoy, said the Czech Republic wants to increase the proportion of its electric power generated by nuclear reactors to 50% from the current 30%. 

Full Text 
PRAGUE -- The Czech Republic is pushing ahead with a large-scale expansion of its nuclear-power industry despite increasing misgivings about atomic energy among its 
neighbors in Europe. 
On Monday, the country's government-controlled CEZ AS will issue technical specifications for a $25 billion project to build up to five new nuclear reactors, with the first two 
scheduled to go online by 2025. 

CEZ has invited three bidders to participate in this final round: French state-controlled Areva SA; Westinghouse Electric Co., a U.S. unit of Japan's Toshiba; and Russia's state-

owned nuclear company Rosatom. 
In choosing a winner, the Czechs must decide whether to stick with a European partner, increase dependence on energy-giant Russia or look to the U.S.-Japanese team for 
diversity. Some Czech politicians have said the country is already far too dependent on Russia for energy supplies. Roughly three-quarters of its oil and gas, as well as all its 
nuclear fuel, come from Russia. And last week, Prime Minister Petr Necas said his government wants to deepen trans-Atlantic ties. 

Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech government's special energy envoy, said the Czech Republic wants to increase the proportion of its electric power generated by nuclear reactors to 
50% from the current 30%. 
"There is antinuclear sentiment in some countries," Mr. Bartuska added. But until alternate energy sources make economic sense, "we see nuclear as the solution." 

CEZ, which is operating six reactors now, has long been one of Europe's largest power exporters, sending electricity to neighboring Germany and elsewhere. 
The Czech strategy runs counter to the approach of Berlin, which, after the partial meltdown this year of a Japanese nuclear plant following an earthquake and tsunami, has 
pulled the plug on atomic power. 

Germany has already shut down seven older reactors and plans to phase out the rest of its nuclear generation by 2022. Switzerland also has shelved plans for new reactors, and 

Italy has put tentative plans for a pilot plant on hold. 
German and Austrian politicians have called for the Czechs to drop their nuclear-expansion plans. In Austria, which imports Czech electricity, parliament is considering a bill to 
prohibit the purchase of nuclear power. 

Such a ban would be almost impossible to implement in practice, however, because electricity from all sources -- including nuclear, coal-powered and solar generators -- is indistinguishable in the power grid. 
Mr. Bartuska said that the accident in Japan highlights the need for high safety standards. But he said that in order to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, nuclear power is critical. "We have burned our fingers with massive funding and subsidies for photovoltaic power," he added. "At the present stage we do not see renewables as a way forward if they have to be heavily subsidized." 
Germany has said it will try to use renewable fuels such as wind, hydro, solar and biomass to replace the generation capacity it is losing because of its antinuclear stance. 
Alan Svoboda, the head of sales at CEZ, called this "the German experiment" and predicted it would drive up electricity costs for most Europeans. 
"We believe the prospect of having to address global warming and the search for energy security will eventually persuade most governments that nuclear energy is the least bad 

solution," said Derek Weaving, an analyst at Renaissance Capital.

Abstract 
Wind power may emit zero carbon, but windmills need up to 90% of their capacity backed up to prevent blackouts -- usually with coal and gas plants. 

Full Text 
The United Nations will convene its 17th annual climate-change conference next month in Durban, South Africa, with the purpose of sealing a new carbon-cutting deal to succeed the soon-to-expire 1997 Kyoto Protocol. It promises to be a historic event, if not in the way the organizers might hope. 
The chances that a global deal on carbon would ever be reached were always slim, a point brought home by the collapse of the comic 2009 Copenhagen summit. But obituaries are sometimes late to print. Now, at last, the U.S., Russia and Japan have all said they won't agree to any new binding carbon pact, while India and China were never believers in the first place. 
That leaves the European Union, which until last month was "the only one still considering signing up in some fashion to a second commitment period," according to Todd Stern, the Obama Administration's climate negotiator. Even that's no longer true. Last week, EU Climate Action Director General Jos Delbeke told reporters that "in reality what may happen is that the Europeans will pronounce themselves politically in favor of the Kyoto Protocol" but won't lock themselves into any new anticarbon pacts unless "other parties join the club." Regarding that likelihood, see above. 
That isn't the only reality check Europe is facing on the carbon front. In an internal memo first reported last week by Dow Jones Newswires, the European Commission's energy department observed that "there is a trade-off between climate-change policies and competitiveness." By the EU's own estimate, the cost of meeting its current carbon emissions targets -- a cut of at least 20% of 1990 emissions levels by 2020 -- comes to at least 48 billion euros ($67 billion) per year. 
For a closer look at the price Europeans pay for their carbon virtue, consider Tata, Europe's second-largest steelmaker. Last month the company warned that "EU carbon legislation threatens to impose huge additional costs on the steel industry," citing this as one reason to close some of its U.K. operations and possibly cut some 1,200 jobs. Yet under the terms of Europe's cap-and-trade scheme, Tata could be paid at least 20 million euros this year and next for those closures and layoffs. 
Europe also seems to be getting wiser, if not yet wise, to the prohibitive costs of being green. In Britain, the government of David Cameron -- which entered office last year promising to be the country's "greenest government ever" -- has scrapped plans for a carbon-capture-and-storage plant in Scotland, which was set to bust its GBP 1 billion budget. "If there was a completely unlimited resource then we may have been able to surmount the technical problems," Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne told the BBC. 
Then there are those "technical problems." The process of capturing and compressing CO2 is energy-intensive. Storing the carbon once it's been sequestered is another issue. In Germany, a 30-megawatt carbon-capture pilot plant has been in operation since 2008. Yet plant-operator Vattenfall must truck the sequestered CO2 more than 150 kilometers daily to store it in the nearest suitable locale. The company also recently suspended its plans for large-scale carbon capture and storage at Janschwalde in Germany. Environmental groups oppose putting carbon underground because they fear living above huge carbon sinks. 
And so it goes with every technology that claims to promise greenhouse-gas salvation. Wind power may emit zero carbon, but windmills need up to 90% of their capacity backed up to prevent blackouts -- usually with coal and gas plants. Windmills also kill a lot of birds. As for solar power, a new study from the University of Tennessee and Occupational Knowledge International finds that manufacturing the necessary lead batteries threatens to release more than 2.4 million tons of lead pollution by 2022, or one-third of today's total global lead production. 
The science on climate change and man's influence on it is far from settled. The question today is whether it makes sense to combat a potential climate threat by imposing economically destructive regulations and sinking billions into failure-prone technologies that have their own environmental costs. The earnest people going to Durban next month may think so. The rest of the world is wearier and wiser.

Full Text 
Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney, whose health-care record as governor of Massachusetts has left him struggling to win the support of conservative voters, now faces another point of vulnerability: his environmental record. 
Just days after his 2002 election, Mr. Romney hired Douglas Foy, one of the state's most prominent environmental activists, and put him in charge of supervising four state agencies. 
Mr. Foy had initiated a lawsuit that led to the cleanup of Boston Harbor and had worked to protect fishing grounds and seashores. Once in the Romney administration, he served as the governor's negotiator on a regional climate-change initiative and helped draft regulations to put emissions caps in place for coal-fired power plants. 
With Mr. Foy by his side, Mr. Romney joined activists outside an aging, coal-fired plant in 2003 to show his commitment to the emissions caps. "I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant, that plant kills people," he said. 
Mr. Romney, while implementing the emissions caps, ultimately backed away from the regional climate-change agreement in 2005. 
Now, Mr. Romney's record on the environment is becoming fodder for rivals in the presidential race who are trying to stoke doubts about his commitment to conservative principles. On Friday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry launched a broadside against his rival's environmental record, saying it showed he would govern like President Barack Obama. 
"Massachusetts was one of the first states to implement its own cap and trade program, which included limits on carbon emissions from power plants," Mr. Perry said in a speech outside Atlanta. 
The Romney campaign accused Mr. Perry of using "distortions and fabrications" to tag Mr. Romney with policies either initiated by his predecessor governors or implemented by his successor, Democrat Deval Patrick. 
"Rick Perry supported Al Gore for president. Instead of distorting Mitt Romney's record, Mr. Perry should explain why he lined up behind Al Gore's radical environmental agenda," said campaign aide Eric Fehrnstrom, a former top official in the Romney administration. 
As a candidate, Mr. Romney has laid out an economic plan that would amend the Clean Air Act to exclude carbon dioxide from its regulatory purview and open U.S. energy reserves to more development. 
In his five-year quest for the presidency, Mr. Romney has been bedeviled not only by his Massachusetts health-care plan, which mandated that most individuals purchase insurance, but also his shifts on abortion and gun control. In 2004, he signed an assault weapons ban for his state, although he now opposes most gun control. And he promised as governor he would keep his state's pro-abortion rights position, though now he opposes legal abortions. 
Mr. Romney says that his health-care plan was good policy for Massachusetts, but that as president he'd work to overturn Mr. Obama's health-care law, which also includes an individual mandate. 
"He may very well emerge as the best choice, but he's certainly not going to be the first choice of a number of Republicans," John Ullyot, a GOP strategist and long-time Senate staffer, said of Mr. Romney. "And that stems from the inherent difficulty of being a Northeastern, successful Republican governor turning around and trying to appeal to a far more conservative electorate." 
A Quinnipiac University poll of Republican voters released Wednesday put Mr. Romney on top in the GOP race, but with only 22% of the primary vote. Former pizza company executive Herman Cain surged to second with 17%, followed by Mr. Perry with 14%. 
Mr. Romney's approach to the environment as governor showed someone who was open to regulatory as well as market-oriented answers to environmental problems -- while also willing to work with committed environmentalists and liberal Democrats. 
His record in Massachusetts is more complicated than the summary offered by Mr. Perry. Mr. Romney actually refused to join the regional cap-and-trade program his administration helped create. As governor, he angered business leaders and environmentalists alike. But that complexity may be part of his problem among voters seeking consistency or clarity. 
From the start of his administration, Mr. Romney set out to reconcile a pro-business political bent with his state's liberal environmentalism, said Eric Kriss, a close confidante of Mr. Romney's from their days co-founding the private equity firm Bain Capital. During the Romney campaign for governor, Mr. Kriss consulted frequently with Mr. Foy. 
"Doug was known as a pre-eminent conservationist," he said. "He was broad-minded, articulate, and he believed in the vision we all had, to combine environmental concerns with the need for housing and transportation infrastructure." 
Mr. Foy was put in charge of commonwealth development, overseeing transportation, housing, environment and energy agencies. Mr. Foy, a political independent who votes Democratic, said he joined the Romney administration not to combat climate change but because the governor was promoting "smart growth" measures and combining warring state agencies. 
He said that Mr. Romney's environmental record fits "the Republican tradition in Massachusetts" of "fiscal conservatism and good governance, doing more with less." 
Romney campaign aides said his efforts involving coal-fired plants were merely the tail end of a process launched by his predecessor, Republican Gov. Jane Swift. Mr. Foy said the governor was not personally involved in drafting the emissions caps placed on the plants, but "he was certainly well aware" of the regulations. 
On Dec. 7, 2005, the Romney administration unveiled the final orders. "These carbon emission limits will provide real and immediate progress in the battle to improve our environment," then-Gov. Romney said in a press release. 
Mr. Foy said that as he was negotiating a cap-and-trade regime with other states, Mr. Romney made it clear he believed in human-caused global warming and wanted a policy response. At the time, many conservatives were open to a cap-and-trade system, seeing it as a market-driven solution. 
Still, Mr. Foy said, the governor peppered him with questions about the economic impacts of a carbon-trading system. At his urging, negotiators built business-oriented provisions into the agreement. But after instructing Mr. Foy to press forward to negotiate an agreement, Mr. Romney ultimately backed out, saying the deal lacked a "safety valve" to cap plant payments if they exceeded emission limits.

Abstract 
(Emphasis in original.) Two years later, Copenhagen became the epicenter of a world-wide media frenzy as some 5,000 journalists, along with some 100 world leaders and scores of celebrities, descended on the Danish capital to witness what was billed as the best opportunity to impose a global tax or limit on carbon dioxide. Put another way, over the past decade, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions -- about 6.1 billion tons per year -- could have gone to zero and yet global emissions still would have gone up. 4 We have to get better -- and we are -- at turning energy into useful power. 

Full Text 
Over the past two months, environmental activists have held protests at the White House and elsewhere hoping to convince the Obama administration to deny a permit for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Some of those same activists have launched a series of demonstrations called "Moving Planet" to move "the planet away from fossil fuels towards a safer climate future." And next month, leaders from dozens of countries will meet at the 17th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban, South Africa. 
But for all of the sturm und drang about climate change, what has actually happened? It's time to acknowledge five obvious truths about the climate-change issue: 
1) The carbon taxers/limiters have lost. Carbon-dioxide emissions have been the environmental issue of the past decade. Over that time period, Al Gore became a world-renowned figure for his documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," for which he won an Oscar. In 2007, he, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), collected a Nobel Peace Prize for "informing the world of the dangers posed by climate change." That same year, the IPCC released its fourth assessment report, which declared that "most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions." (Emphasis in original.) 
Two years later, Copenhagen became the epicenter of a world-wide media frenzy as some 5,000 journalists, along with some 100 world leaders and scores of celebrities, descended on the Danish capital to witness what was billed as the best opportunity to impose a global tax or limit on carbon dioxide. 
The result? Nothing, aside from promises by various countries to get serious -- really serious -- about carbon emissions sometime soon. 
Here's a reality check: During the same decade that Mr. Gore and the IPCC dominated the environmental debate, global carbon-dioxide emissions rose by 28.5%. 
Those increases reflect soaring demand for electricity, up by 36%, which in turn fostered a 47% increase in coal consumption. (Natural-gas use increased by 29% while oil use grew by 13%.) Carbon-dioxide emissions are growing because people around the world understand the essentiality of electricity to modernity. And for many countries, the cheapest way to produce electrons is by burning coal. 
2) Regardless of whether it's getting hotter or colder -- or both -- we are going to need to produce a lot more energy in order to remain productive and comfortable. 
3) The carbon-dioxide issue is not about the United States anymore. Sure, the U.S. is the world's second-largest energy consumer. But over the past decade, carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. fell by 1.7%. And according to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. is now cutting carbon emissions faster than Europe, even though the European Union has instituted an elaborate carbon-trading/pricing scheme. Why? The U.S. is producing vast quantities of cheap natural gas from shale, which is displacing higher-carbon coal. 
Meanwhile, China's emissions jumped by 123% over the past decade and now exceed those of the U.S. by more than two billion tons per year. Africa's carbon-dioxide emissions jumped by 30%, Asia's by 44%, and the Middle East's by a whopping 57%. Put another way, over the past decade, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions -- about 6.1 billion tons per year -- could have gone to zero and yet global emissions still would have gone up. 
4) We have to get better -- and we are -- at turning energy into useful power. In 1882, Thomas Edison's first central power station on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan converted less than 3% of the heat energy of the coal being burned into electricity. Today's best natural-gas-fired turbines have thermal efficiencies of 60%. Nearly all of the things we use on a daily basis -- light bulbs, computers, automobiles -- are vastly more efficient than they were just a few years ago. And over the coming years those devices will get even better at turning energy into useful lighting, computing and motive power. 
5) The science is not settled, not by a long shot. Last month, scientists at CERN, the prestigious high-energy physics lab in Switzerland, reported that neutrinos might -- repeat, might -- travel faster than the speed of light. If serious scientists can question Einstein's theory of relativity, then there must be room for debate about the workings and complexities of the Earth's atmosphere. 
Furthermore, even if we accept that carbon dioxide is bad, it's not clear exactly what we should do about it. In September, Tom Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder published a report that determined "switching from coal to natural gas would do little for global climate." Mr. Wigley found that the particulates put into the atmosphere by coal-fired power plants, "although detrimental to the environment, cool the planet by blocking incoming sunlight." 
If Mr. Wigley's right, then using sources that emit no particulates, like nuclear and natural gas, will not make a major difference in averting near-term changes in the climate caused by carbon dioxide. But then -- and here's the part that most media outlets failed to discuss when reporting on the Wigley study -- widespread use of renewables such as wind and solar won't help much, either. 
Will Happer, a professor of physics at Princeton and a skeptic about global climate change, recently wrote that the "contemporary 'climate crusade' has much in common with the medieval crusades." Indeed, politicians and pundits are hectored to adhere to the orthodoxy of the carbon-dioxide-is-the-only-climate-problem alarmists. And that orthodoxy prevails even though the most ardent alarmists have no credible plans to replace the hydrocarbons that now provide 87% of the world's energy. 
It's time to move the debate past the dogmatic view that carbon dioxide is evil and toward a world view that accepts the need for energy that is cheap, abundant and reliable.

ALEXANDRIA, VA. 
Mayor Donates $50 Million 
To Counter Coal Plants 
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday he will donate $50 million to the Sierra Club to promote its fight against coal-fired power plants. 
Mr. Bloomberg announced the gift, which will be spread over four years, at a GenOn coal plant in Alexandria, Va., just outside of Washington. 
"Ending coal power production is the right thing to do," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and 

the impact on public health is significant." 

Bruce Nilles, the environmental advocacy group's deputy conservation director, said Mr. Bloomberg had expressed frustration with what he saw as Congress's slow pace on 
climate change issues. Mr. Nilles said the gift will allow the Sierra Club to expand its campaign to about 45 states from 15. 
Carol Raulston, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, said that by targeting coal, the Sierra Club aims to take away the most affordable electricity in the country. 
"The Sierra Club gets sizable donations from a lot of very wealthy Americans who don't really understand the circumstances of people less fortunate than they, who worry about 

paying electricity bills," Ms. Raulston said. "There would have been more productive ways for the mayor to donate his money to address greenhouse gas emissions, but it's his 
money."

Met Hits 40-Year Record 
The Metropolitan Museum of Art posted its highest attendance in 40 years during its most recent fiscal year, with 5.68 million visitors frequenting the institution, the museum 
said Thursday. 

That figure, which includes attendance to both its Upper East Side headquarters and the Cloisters Museum & Gardens, the Met's branch in Fort Tryon Park, is 400,000 higher 

than the museum's attendance during the previous fiscal year. 
"We are delighted by this extraordinary response to our collections and programs, especially in the context of ongoing fiscal challenges faced by both the Museum and the 
public," Director and Chief Executive Thomas Campbell said in a statement. 

Intense interest in one of the museum's special exhibitions, "Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty," which has received more than 500,000 visitors since it opened May 4, helped 
set the 40-year record.

The EPA's War on Jobs

Abstract 
According to the EPA's own numbers, every dollar in direct benefits costs $1,847. 

Full Text 
President Obama's jobs council will make its first recommendations today on lifting hiring and strengthening the economy. Too bad the message doesn't seem to be reaching the Administration's regulators, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The EPA is currently conducting a campaign against coal-fired power and one of its most destructive weapons is a pending regulation to limit mercury and other hazardous air pollutants like dioxins or acid gases that power plants emit. The 946-page rule mandates that utilities install "maximum achievable control technology" under the Clean Air Act ­
- and even by the EPA's lowball estimates, it is the most expensive rule in the agency's history. 
In 1990, Congress gave the EPA discretion to decide if mercury regulation is "necessary and appropriate," and the Clinton Administration did so in its final days. The Bush Administration created a modest mercury program, only to have it overturned by an appeals court on technical grounds in its final days. The case was still in litigation when Mr. Obama took office, and his appointees used the opening to strafe the power industry, proposing a much more stringent rule. 
The EPA issued the utility rule in March, with only 60 days for public comment. Basic administrative practice usually affords between 120 and 180 days, especially for complex or costly regulations of this scale. The proposal was obviously rushed, with numerous errors like overstating U.S. mercury emissions by a factor of 1,000. The word in Washington is that the openly politicized process unsettled even the EPA's career staff. 
The agency estimates that the utility rule will cost $10.9 billion annually but will yield as much as $140 billion in total health and environmental benefits. Sounds like a deal. But most of those alleged benefits are indirect -- i.e., not from the mercury reductions that the rule is supposed to be for. Rather, they come from pollutants ("airborne particles") that the EPA already regulates under other parts of the Clean Air Act. A good analogy is a corporation double-counting revenue. 
According to the EPA's own numbers, every dollar in direct benefits costs $1,847. The reason is that electric generation -- yes, even demon coal -- results in negligible quantities of air pollutants like mercury. And mercury is on the decline: In 2005, the entire U.S. coal fleet emitted 26% less than the EPA predicted. 
The real goal of the EPA's rule is to shut down fossil fuel electric power in the name of climate change. The consensus estimate in the private sector is that the utility rule and eight others on the EPA docket will force the retirement of 60 out of the country's current 340 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity. Reliability downgrades will hit the South and Midwest where coal energy is concentrated. American Electric Power recently announced that the rules will force it to shut down five plants in West Virginia and Ohio, a quarter of its coal fleet. 
The power industry estimates that the true costs of the utility rule will far exceed the EPA estimates, which of course will be passed to consumers and businesses as higher prices. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, normally a White House union ally, says the rule will destroy 50,000 jobs and another 200,000 down the supply chain. That's more jobs lost than if Boeing went bust. 
Astonishingly, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson claimed in March that the utility rule is "expected to create jobs," because it will "increase demand for pollution control technology" and "new workers will be needed to install, operate, and maintain" it. In other words, the government should harm an industry and force it to ruin working assets so maybe other people can clean up the mess. 
Such theories help explain why the economic recovery and job creation are far weaker than they ought to be, but the good news is that even many Democrats are beginning to push back against the EPA's willful damage. The least Congress can do is force the EPA to delay the final utility rule to allow for more public debate, though a better option would be to junk it.

Abstract 
If made law, the plan would put Australia far ahead of other industrialized nations in terms of taxing carbon emissions at a time when the success of such systems in reducing pollution and changing behavior patterns remains unproven. 

Full Text 
Almost a year since former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was ousted by his own party as he tried to introduce a controversial mining tax, his successor, Julia Gillard, risks the same fate. She is pushing for a tariff on greenhouse gases and an emissions-trading system that she hopes will shrink the nation's carbon footprint. 
Exact figures on how much money companies and individuals here will have to pay are still to be defined. In theory, at least, the basic plan will tax 1,000 of the biggest carbon producers something in the region of 20 Australian dollars (US$21) per ton of carbon from July 2012. A comprehensive emissions-trading system would be introduced three to five years later. 
The proposal could generate about A$11.5 billion in the first year, much of which would returned to households and businesses. If made law, the plan would put Australia far ahead of other industrialized nations in terms of taxing carbon emissions at a time when the success of such systems in reducing pollution and changing behavior patterns remains unproven. 
Critics argue the tax will struggle to reduce the nation's carbon footprint, endanger jobs and add to the costs of manufacturers already hurt by the competitive burden of the strong Australian dollar. Given that the proposal would yield few visible benefits for either Australians or the economy, skeptics attribute Ms. Gillard's move to the powerful influence exerted by the Greens party, which supports the Labor-led administration. 
A report last week by Australia's Productivity Commission found that a carbon tax would be the best way to reduce emissions and wouldn't endanger jobs. But many experts are unconvinced. 
"It's not a positive economic thing to do," said Tim Jordan, an environmental, social and governance analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. "The argument is that the economic cost of changing is worth the unmitigated cost of climate change." 
The potential for higher utility bills as a result of the tax has added to the opposition. Electricity, about three-quarters produced from coal, accounts for the biggest share of Australia's emissions. Converting these plants to cleaner fuels could take decades and cost billions of dollars. 
Regardless of Australia's emissions policies, it still exports more than 260 million tons of coal a year. Much of it goes to fuel smelters and power plants in China, a country that shows little interest in preventing global warming or reducing emissions. Any progress in reducing pollution here would be quickly erased by the inexorable increase in Australia's exports of carbon-producing commodities like coal, ore and natural gas.

Abstract 
Because that will hurt us, not him, and define us, not him. [...] he's attempting to focus on economic issues, on which he has personal and professional credibility.\n 

Full Text 
Of course he should resign -- or, better, and as a statement, the House should remove him. I speak as a conservative who wishes to conserve. If I were speaking as a Republican I'd say, "By all means keep him, let him taint all your efforts." 
But sometimes all of Washington has to put up its hand up like a traffic cop and say no. It has to say: That doesn't go here, it's not acceptable, it's not among the normal human transgressions of back stairs, love affairs and the congressman on the take. This is decadence. It is pornography. We can't let the world, and the young, know it's "politically survivable." Because that will hurt us, not him, and define us, not him. So: Enough. 
In other news, Mitt Romney had his first good week. It was startling. He stepped out from the blur. The other candidates now call him "the front runner." By most standards he was the front runner months ago, but nobody talked about him. He didn't live in the Republican imagination. It was "Will Mitch run?" and "You like Pawlenty?" Only seven minutes into the conversation would you get, "How will Romney do?" He was so '08, that disastrous year. 
But this week he got three big boosts. He had a reasonable announcement speech followed by a lot of national interviews. Then the Washington Post poll: Mr. Romney leads President Obama. On top of that, the two most visible Republicans the past 10 days were Sarah Palin, on her magical mystery tour, and him. They got all the coverage, and for a moment it seemed like a two-person race. Meaning a lot of Republicans got to think, "Hmm, Palin or Romney -- a trip to Crazytown or the man of sober mien." That did not hurt him. 
The financial reporting period ends June 30. Mr. Romney's focused like a laser on getting the kind of numbers that will demoralize rivals and impress the media. Money leads to money. At a Manhattan fund-raiser this week, an organizer said they raised about $200,000, not bad for an hour at the end of a long day of fund-raising. The roughly 70 attendees were mostly men in suits. There was no vibration of "I'd walk on burning coals for this guy." More an air of "This is a sound choice." On the other hand, no one was distractedly checking his BlackBerry in the back of the room, as I saw once at a Giuliani event in 2008. He was talking, they were scrolling. That's what we call "a sign." 
Mr. Romney's emergence means a new phase in the primary contest begins. So some quick observations on the front runner. We'll begin with shallowness and try to work our way up. 
All candidates for president are network or local. Romney is a network anchorman -- sleek, put together, the right hair, a look of dignity. He's like Brian Williams. Some candidates are local anchormen -- they're working hard, they're pros, but they lack the patina, the national sense. Reagan, Clinton, Obama -- they were network. This has to do not only with persona, but with a perceived broadness of issues and competencies. It's not decisive, and it can change -- Harry Truman was local and became network. But it probably helps Mr. Romney that he's network. 
His seamless happiness can be grating. People like to root for the little guy, and he's never been the little guy. His family has never in his lifetime known financial ill fortune, and his personal wealth is of the self-made kind, the most grating because it means you can't even patronize him. He has in him that way of people who are chipper about each day in large part because each day has been very nice to them. This makes some people want to punch him in the nose. I said once he's like an account executive on "Mad Men," stepping from the shower and asking George the valet to bring him the blue shirt with the white collar. But this year he looks slightly older, maybe wiser, maybe a little more frayed than in 2008. Which is good. Since 2008 everyone else is more frayed, too. 
In '08, Romney's brand was at odds with his stand. He looked and had the feel of a well-born Eastern moderate Republican. But he positioned and portrayed himself as grass­roots tea party. It was jarring, didn't seem to fit, and contributed to the impression that he was an attractive lump of poll-tested packaging. He's trying to get around this in two ways. First, he's attempting to focus on economic issues, on which he has personal and professional credibility. Second, he's trying to demonstrate authenticity by sticking to some stands unpopular with the base -- global warming, health care. 
The common wisdom has been that health care is the huge weak spot in his candidacy. Maybe, but maybe not. The base hates ObamaCare, as we know, and Mr. Romney devised a similar plan as governor of Massachusetts. But he can talk earnestly about it on the hustings until voters' eyes glaze over and they plead to change the subject, which he will. And there are a lot of other subjects. If he gets through the primaries, his position on health care will become a plus: The Democrats this year will try to paint the Republican candidate as radical on health spending. It would be harder to do that to Mr. Romney. 
Has enough time passed since his famous flip-flops on issues like abortion to make them old news? Four years ago it colored his candidacy. We'll find out if people decide it's yesterday's story and give him a second look. 
The real problem for Romney is: Does he mean it? Is he serious when he takes a stand? Has he thought it through or merely adopted it? And there is of course religion. In a silly and baiting interview with Piers Morgan on CNN, Mr. Romney swatted away an insistence that he delve into Mormonism and, by implication, defend it. It was like seeing some Brit in 1960 trying to make John F. Kennedy explain and defend Catholicism. It's not something we do in America. Because we still have a little class. 
When Mr. Romney's father, George, ran for the GOP nomination in 1968, his religion was not an issue. Forty years later, when his son first ran, it was. Has America grown more illiberal? Maybe not. In 1968, evangelical Christians voted in Democratic primaries, because they tended to be Democrats. By 1980, all that was changing: Evangelicals went Republican with Reagan and never came back. 
Catholics do not tend to take a harsh view of Mormonism, nor do mainstream Protestants. It is evangelical Christians who are most inclined not to approve. In a general election this would not make much difference: Evangelicals will not vote for Obama. But in the GOP primaries it could still hurt Mr. Romney. No one knows, because no one knows what kind of year this is. Maybe evangelicals will have seen enough of him not to mind; maybe the Obama presidency convinced them it's not so important. 
My own read is standard Catholic. Mormons have been, on balance, a deeply constructive force in American life, and it is absurd and ignorant not to support a political figure only because you do not prefer or identify with the theology of his church. 
Really, grow up. Enough.

Abstract 
[...] demand is expected to soar as the government moves to improve air quality in the country's heavily polluted cities by switching from coal to gas in power generation and running more commercial vehicles and buses on natural gas rather than gasoline. 

Full Text 
The increasing abundance of cheap natural gas, coupled with rising demand for the fuel from China and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, may have set the stage for a "golden age of gas," the International Energy Agency said Monday. 
Under a scenario set out by the IEA, global consumption of natural gas could rise by more than 50% over the next 25 years, with it accounting for more than a quarter of global energy demand by 2035, up from 21% now. 
But while natural gas is more clean-burning than coal and oil, it is still a fossil fuel, and its increased use will lead to higher emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, the IEA warned. More gas will also mean low-carbon energy sources like renewables and nuclear power could be squeezed out. "An expansion of gas use alone is no panacea for climate change," said Nobuo Tanaka, the IEA's executive director. 
The global natural-gas market is in the midst of a revolution that has huge implications for the future of energy. In the U.S., technological advances such as hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking" -- in which water laced with chemicals is injected into the ground to crack open dense, gas-bearing shale rock -- have fueled a surge in production from vast new gas reserves stretching from Texas to Pennsylvania. Such techniques are now being employed in other countries with big shale-gas resources, such as China. The IEA says that, over the next 25 years, 40% of the growth in total gas production will come from unconventional gas. 
The shale revolution has led to substantial upward revisions in estimates for total global reserves of gas. The IEA says there are enough gas resources to sustain current production levels for more than 250 years. And unlike oil, which is concentrated in the politically fragile Middle East, gas is widely dispersed geographically, making it attractive from an energy-security perspective. 
The rise of shale has coincided with a huge expansion of the global trade in liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which has vastly increased the availability of a fuel that for decades could only be pumped via pipelines. Gas also has benefited from the repercussions of Fukushima. Japan's gas demand has shot up since the disaster forced it to take much of its nuclear capacity offline. And, in the long term, Germany's gas consumption is also expected to grow strongly after it decided last month to shut down its 17 nuclear reactors. 
But the biggest factor in the development of global gas markets over the coming years is likely to be China, the IEA says. There, demand is expected to soar as the government moves to improve air quality in the country's heavily polluted cities by switching from coal to gas in power generation and running more commercial vehicles and buses on natural gas rather than gasoline. 
Under the IEA's new "golden age of gas" scenario, China's consumption of the fuel would rise from the level of Germany in 2010 to match that of the entire European Union in 2035. To meet the growth in demand, annual gas production would have to increase by 1.8 trillion cubic meters by 2035 -- about three times the current output of Russia. 
The IEA sounded a note of caution on the boom in shale gas, saying concerns about the possible environmental impact of fracking made the outlook for unconventional gas production "uncertain." Some conservation groups fear fracking can contaminate drinking-water supplies, though the industry says the technique is safe when performed properly. 
Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief economist, said the agency's high-gas-consumption scenario depended on a number of factors -- among them, the industry's ability to fully address public concerns about fracking, excessive water use and the risk of contamination. "If gas companies want to see a golden age of gas, they need to apply golden standards for. . .producing gas," he said.

Abstract 
Mr. Bryson spent 18 years as chief executive of a California power company, Edison International, and before that, was a state regulator. Since 2008, he has served as a senior adviser to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., and on Walt Disney Co.'s board, as well as Boeing's. 

Full Text 
President Barack Obama on Tuesday named John Bryson, a longtime energy executive and environmental advocate, to lead the Commerce Department, but the nomination could face resistance from Senate Republicans. 
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Bryson would head up the administration's effort to double exports and promote U.S. businesses around the world. He also would bring to the cabinet a corporate record and contacts that could help Mr. Obama shore up relations with business leaders. 
A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) repeated Tuesday that Senate Republicans would block any nominee for Commerce until pending trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia were sent to Congress for ratification. Those deals are being delayed by a dispute over Trade Adjustment Assistance, a program aimed at helping workers who lose their jobs because of trade-opening deals. 
"This should not be a difficult decision for the president, particularly when the president himself agrees with us that these agreements will create jobs here in America," McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said. 
"We think that it would be folly to hold up a nomination so important as the Commerce secretary for any reason," replied White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. 
Separately, some Republicans voiced concerns Tuesday about Mr. Bryson's record of environmental advocacy. Mr. Bryson, 67 years old, was a co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which he left in 1974. He also has favored a cap on U.S. industry's carbon emissions as a way to combat climate change. 
White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, a former J.P. Morgan Chase executive who held the Commerce post during the Clinton administration, led the search. Mr. Daley served on the Boeing Co. board with Mr. Bryson from 2006 until Mr. Daley left early this year. 
Mr. Obama on Tuesday focused on Mr. Bryson's business background. Mr. Bryson spent 18 years as chief executive of a California power company, Edison International, and before that, was a state regulator. Since 2008, he has served as a senior adviser to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., and on Walt Disney Co.'s board, as well as Boeing's. 
"In this new role, John will be able to draw on decades of business experience across a range of industries," Mr. Obama said. "That's the expertise that will help us create new jobs and make America more competitive in the global economy." 
Business groups responded positively, though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stopped short of endorsing Mr. Bryson's confirmation. "We hope Mr. Bryson will be a strong voice for American businesses," the Chamber said in a statement. 
The National Association of Manufacturers welcomed the appointment, noting that Mr. Bryson "serves on the board of many manufacturing companies, which gives him the advantage of having exposure to the difficult issues manufacturers face in today's global marketplace." 
Mr. Bryson retired from Edison in 2008. During his tenure, he helped define the terms of California's electricity deregulation plan in the late 1990s, and shifted Edison's power generation to cleaner-burning fuels. Its chief utility unit, Southern California Edison, sold off most of its fossil-fueled plants in California, but retained its nuclear and hydroelectric capacity in the West. He also actively supported the development of electric vehicles. 
He began his career as an activist. Fresh out of Yale Law School, he co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that regularly sued government and business alike to enforce environmental protections. More recently, he served on the United Nations Secretary-General's Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change. He endorsed a cap on carbon emissions as long as coal-dependent utilities were given time to adapt, a position shared by many others in the industry. 
Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.,), the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized Mr. Bryson for co-founding the "radical" environmental group, and for calling a bill to control carbon emissions "moderate" that Mr. Inhofe believes would lead to job losses. "I will be working actively to defeat this nomination," he said. 
If confirmed, Mr. Bryson would succeed Gary Locke, who is leaving the Commerce post to become ambassador to China.

Physicist Freeman Dyson in the foreword to "The Shale Gas Shock," a report just published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation: 
[Author] Matt Ridley gives us a fair and even-handed account of the environmental costs and benefits of shale gas. The lessons to be learned are clear. The environmental costs of shale gas are much smaller than the environmental costs of coal. Because of shale gas, the air in Beijing will be cleaned up as the air in London was cleaned up sixty years ago. Because of shale gas, clean air will no longer be a luxury that only rich countries can afford. Because of shale gas, wealth and health will be distributed more equitably over the face of our planet.

Schwarzenegger Is Mistaken About EPA and Clean Air

Abstract 
The EPA's power grab on carbon dioxide -- in which the agency actually admits to overriding parts of the Clean Air Act -- and broader war on coal-generated power cannot be explained in any other way. 

Full Text 
The straw-man argument that legislation to rein in the EPA's worst abuses would somehow dirty the air is an unworthy one for a strongman like Arnold Schwarzenegger ("The Clean Air Act Keeps Us Healthy," April 21). 
The Clean Air Act's success reflects its original focus on practical solutions that balance costs and benefits to achieve significant improvements in air quality at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the Obama administration's EPA has thrown that approach out the window. Its new mercury rule, for example, would cost tens of billions of dollars a year, all of which would be passed on in electricity prices, for a benefit that the EPA estimates to be negligible. That's because U.S. mercury emissions -- currently less than 2% of global emissions -- have been falling for decades, even without costly federal regulation. Mr. Schwarzenegger apparently buys EPA's line that reductions don't "count" unless coerced by the agency. 
Yet the aim of this EPA is not to eke out improvements in air quality but to drive up energy prices, a goal consistently articulated by candidate Barack Obama during his presidential campaign. The EPA's power grab on carbon dioxide -- in which the agency actually admits to overriding parts of the Clean Air Act -- and broader war on coal-generated power cannot be explained in any other way. 
Still, Mr. Schwarzenegger says to leave these decisions to the scientists. Which ones? The EPA's captive scientists assert that dioxin in meat, fish and eggs is a major health risk, while the independent National Academies of Sciences concluded that the risk is overblown. The discrepancy comes down to politics. 
That is, making trade-offs is a political, not technocratic, act. Mr. Schwarzenegger is right that Congress made intelligent trade-offs when it enacted the Clean Air Act. But it should not sit idly by while unelected EPA bureaucrats discard the balance the act strikes to further their radical agenda. 
Andrew Grossman

Congress can't be trusted to interfere with the EPA's scientific standards, says Arnold Schwarzenegger. So we are to put all our trust in an unelected, austere, intellectual and totally unbiased guild of wizards who claim to be all-knowing and politically unmotivated? They are not to be challenged by the machinations of a democratically elected Congress? And he was a governor, a man who was at the spearhead of the democratically elected process? 
Michael Greczek 
Houston 
Mr. Schwarzenegger writes that Congress should not substitute political calculations for scientific and medical facts. Mr. Schwarzenegger fails to distinguish why this is different than anything else Congress does. As an example, Congress is a political body, and the majority of its members are not well-schooled in economics. It utilizes populist politics on an electorate, which is also not well-schooled in economics, to get re-elected and to use its powers to create regulations that often have adverse effects on our prosperity. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger applauds the fact that mercury emissions from power plants are now being regulated. I would have been interested to have him explain why California's Title 24, mandating mercury containing compact fluorescent lights in new building construction, was created without consideration for proper disposal of them. Not only do CFLs present a danger to occupants when broken in the home, folks are disposing them improperly, and the lights are ending up in landfills where they contaminate air and water with mercury. 
Dave Zittin 
Cupertino, Calif. 
Most people now realize that the science of anthropogenic climate change is not "settled" and that the methods and motivations of the climate-change movement are highly questionable. By throwing carbon dioxide into the pollutant category, the agency is throwing itself under the bus. The regulators and legislators must restrict their reach to real pollutants, or live with the destruction of their credibility and the resulting backlash against the unjustified regulatory behemoth required to tackle the CO2 chimera.

Abstract 
Using a specialized version of a technique called hydraulic fracturing (now widely known as "fracking" or "fracing"), his team found an economical way to create or expand fractures in the rock and to get the trapped gas to flow. Hydraulic fracturing uses the concentrated pressure of water, sand and a small amount of chemicals to promote the flow of oil and gas in a reservoir. 

Full Text 
In the early 1980s, George P. Mitchell, a Houston-based independent energy producer, could see that his company was going to run out of natural gas. Almost three decades later, the results of his effort to do something about the problem are transforming America's energy prospects and the calculations of analysts around the world. 
Back in those years, Mr. Mitchell's company was contracted to deliver a substantial amount of natural gas from Texas to feed a pipeline serving Chicago. But the reserves on which he depended were running down, and it was not at all clear where he could find more gas to replace the depleting supply. Mr. Mitchell had a strong hunch, however, piqued by a geology report that he had read recently. 
Perhaps the natural gas that was locked into shale -- a dense sedimentary rock -- could be freed and made to flow. He was prepared to back up his hunch with investment. The laboratory for his experiment was a sprawling geologic formation called the Barnett Shale around Dallas and Fort Worth. Almost everyone with whom he worked was skeptical, including his own geologists and engineers. "You're wasting your money," they told him over the years. But Mr. Mitchell kept at it. 
The payoff came a decade and a half later, at the end of the 1990s. Using a specialized version of a technique called hydraulic fracturing (now widely known as "fracking" or "fracing"), his team found an economical way to create or expand fractures in the rock and to get the trapped gas to flow. 
Today, in an age that craves innovation in energy, George Mitchell's breakthrough in the Barnett Shale has opened the door to a potentially profound change in the global energy equation. 
What has become known as the "unconventional-natural-gas revolution" has turned a shortage into a large surplus and transformed the natural-gas business, which supplies almost a quarter of America's total energy. This revolution has arrived, moreover, at a moment when rising oil prices, sparked by turmoil in the Middle East, and the nuclear crisis in Japan have raised anxieties about energy security. Government and producers alike have turned their attention back to domestic resources. 
The rapid rise of shale-gas production has also drawn scrutiny and controversy. Some environmental groups say that the process threatens to contaminate drinking-water supplies. The industry, for its part, points to a long safety record, with some form of fracking having been used in more than a million wells in the U.S. since the end of the 1940s. 
As late as 2000, shale gas was just 1% of American natural-gas supplies. Today, it is about 25% and could rise to 50% within two decades. Estimates of the entire natural-gas resource base, taking shale gas into account, are now as high as 2,500 trillion cubic feet, with a further 500 trillion cubic feet in Canada. That amounts to a more than 100-year supply of natural gas, which is used for everything from home heating and cooking to electric generation, industrial processes and petrochemical feedstocks. 
The effects of the "shale gale" are also being felt in the rest of the world, changing the economics of the liquefied-natural-gas business. Its impact on international energy relations could be significant. Some proponents believe that the U.S., once thought to be short of natural gas, could even become a natural-gas exporter. 
It is a revolution that has progressed in stages. Hydraulic fracturing uses the concentrated pressure of water, sand and a small amount of chemicals to promote the flow of oil and gas in a reservoir. Mitchell Energy's breakthrough was to apply one particular approach -- "light sand fracking" -- to break up what had seemed impermeable: hard shale rock. 
With this technique, the company's gas output began to climb, but capitalizing on the innovation would require a good deal more money. In 2002, Mr. Mitchell merged his company into a larger independent, Devon Energy. 
Devon had expertise in a second technology that would be critical to the shale-gas revolution -- horizontal drilling. Advances in control and measurement allowed operators to drill down to a certain depth and then to drill at an angle or even sideways. This exposes more of the reservoir, permitting the recovery of a much greater amount of gas (or oil). "At that time," said Larry Nichols, the chairman of Devon, "absolutely no one believed that shale drilling worked, other than Mitchell and us." 
Devon experimented with yoking the two technologies together. In 2003, the company drilled 55 wells in the Barnett Shale, optimizing the combination of fracking and horizontal drilling. 
As Devon's gas production started to rise, other independents saw what was happening and honed the techniques further. But the wider energy industry remained focused on what seemed to be the imminent shortfall of conventionally produced natural gas in North America, which, it was thought, would make it necessary to import large quantities of liquefied natural gas from places like Trinidad, Qatar, Algeria and even the Russian island of Sakhalin. 
Then something surprising happened: Thanks to shale gas, overall U.S. natural-gas production went up from 2007 to 2008. That was the signal to the rest of the energy industry, and larger companies were soon turning to shale. It was not until the fall of 2009, however, that leaders in the nation's capital woke up to the fact that something was changing in the U.S. energy mix. It's now well-recognized. In his energy speech on Wednesday, President Barack Obama said, "Recent innovations have given us the opportunity to tap large reserves -- perhaps a century's worth -- in the shale under our feet. The potential here is enormous." 
In the energy industry, use of the new technology quickly gathered speed. The know-how was applied across North America, in such shale formations as Haynesville, mostly in Louisiana; Eagle Ford in South Texas; Woodford in Oklahoma; Horn River and Montney in British Columbia; Duvernay in Alberta; and the "mighty Marcellus," the huge formation that spreads from Pennsylvania and New York down into West Virginia. 
Gas output rose dramatically, and the anticipated shortfall turned into a large surplus. As the volume rose, the inevitable happened -- prices came down. Substantially. Today, natural-gas prices are less than half of what they were just three years ago. 
Shale gas changed the strategic direction of the industry. Larger companies have maintained their commitment to existing multibillion-dollar liquefied-natural-gas projects around the world, but they now intend that gas for markets in Europe and Asia, not North America. At the same time, they have made new multibillion-dollar investments in shale-gas extraction in North America. 
Outside the U.S., potential reserves of shale gas have been identified in countries from Mexico and Argentina to Algeria. Chinese interest is rising swiftly, both for shale gas and for another form of unconventional natural gas, coal-bed methane. It is now thought that Europe's unconventional-gas potential may be as great as North America's. 
Even with increased energy efficiency over the next two decades, growing demand for power in the U.S. could require the equivalent of 540 new coal plants or 200 new nuclear power plants. Coal is inexpensive and abundant, but there is regulatory and environmental opposition to its use because of carbon and other emissions. Nuclear power is carbon-free and has evolved new passive safety features, but it is expensive and, especially after the catastrophe in Japan, faces regulatory and political uncertainty. 
In most states, utilities are now required to have a certain share of renewable energy sources. Most of it has been wind power, but wind is still small-scale and relatively expensive. Because it supplies energy only intermittently, it can be difficult to integrate into the electric grid. 
Further complicating the picture for all of these rival energy sources is uncertainty about what kind of new carbon regulations might come from Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Power companies have been reluctant to make a larger commitment to natural gas because of worries about supply and price volatility. Over the past 30 years, natural gas has been, at different times, abundant and cheap or scarce and expensive. Utility executives made commitments in the late 1990s to what was supposed to be cheap natural gas, only to see prices spike as supplies tightened, contributing to the California power crisis and sending some companies into bankruptcy. 
But shale has changed the equation. Abundant, relatively low-priced supplies now make natural gas a highly competitive alternative to both nuclear and wind power and even to coal generation. It has the added advantage of being relatively low-carbon (though even natural gas will be constrained if the U.S. adopts a policy similar to the European Union's objective of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050). 
Could natural gas also be a game changer for transportation? That is much more of a challenge. Automakers and the fuel-supply industry are already dealing with a multitude of imperatives -- more fuel-efficient cars, more biofuels, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, pure electric vehicles. Making a major push for natural-gas vehicles would add yet another set of mandates and incentives, including the creation of a costly new fueling infrastructure. 
Moreover, the price advantage of natural gas over gasoline shrinks as cars become more fuel-efficient. The most obvious growth area for natural gas in transportation is for urban fleets (taxis, buses and other service vehicles) that have access to a central refueling facility. Some argue for adding long-distance trucks to that list. But if there is a strong large-scale push in general transportation, it might make the power industry fearful of having to compete against motorists for natural-gas supplies and thus more cautious about making a major commitment themselves. 
The arrival of shale gas has received a mixed welcome from environmentalists. Some applaud it as a lower-carbon source of electricity. It is also an "enabler" for renewable energy, providing a source of electricity that can step in to fill the gap when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining. "The sudden abundance of low-cost natural gas is a gift," said Tim Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, who, as a U.S. senator, ran the hearings that turned climate change into a national issue. "But it is a gift that has to be managed properly." Mr. Wirth, like other pro-gas environmentalists, has called on the industry to set standards and create an operating compact with regulators. 
Criticism of shale gas by some environmentalists has risen as operations have spread into regions that are largely unfamiliar with modern oil and gas drilling. Some worry about the amount of water used in the process. But last year, the 3,500 shale-gas wells drilled in the U.S. used only about 0.02% of total water used in the U.S. 
Concerns also have been raised about the possibility that hydraulic fracturing could contaminate the aquifers that supply drinking water. But fracking occurs below drinking-water aquifers, separated by a mile or more of impenetrable rock. 
In Texas, the birthplace of the shale-gas revolution, there is currently a stand-off between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas production. The EPA maintains that two water wells in Parker County, west of Fort Worth, were contaminated by gas from hydraulic fracturing more than a mile below it. The Texas Railroad Commission, using chemical fingerprinting, maintains that the EPA is wrong and that the gas seeped into the well from a shallow formation a few hundred feet beneath the surface, much closer to the water wells. 
Environmental attention has recently shifted to the wastewater that comes back to the surface during drilling. As in any industrial activity, this water has to be either recycled or disposed of in an environmentally appropriate way. In many parts of the country, companies inject the wastewater into deep disposal wells. 
It is not clear whether Pennsylvania has enough of the deep geological formations necessary for such disposal. For the vast Marcellus shale, the issue is whether the state's wastewater treatment facilities are adequate and can keep up with the pace of expansion in shale drilling. The industry has moved to increase the amount of wastewater recycled in drilling operations, currently at over 70% by some estimates. 
The extraction of oil and gas is a highly regulated activity. Historically, the actual drilling, including fracking, has been regulated by states. Virtually all disposal of wastewater is regulated by the EPA, either under the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Clean Water Act, but the EPA may delegate actual enforcement of these regulations to the states. 
In an era of heightened environmental awareness, any incident, even involving a single water well, can become a national event. As a recent analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative put it, "With over 20,000 shale wells drilled in the last 10 years, the environmental record of shale-gas development is for the most part a good one. Nevertheless, one must recognize . . . the damage that can be caused by just one poor operation." 
Debates will continue about state versus federal regulation, industry standards and the underlying facts in particular cases. What many analysts expect to see is the emergence of a set of "best practices," endorsed by both regulators and industry, that are tailored to the specific characteristics of the diverse basins across the country. For shale gas production to succeed on a massive scale, public confidence will be essential. 
All of these issues have emerged relatively recently, and it will take some time to sort them out. But we should not lose sight of the larger picture: the potential for a century's worth of inexpensive, environmentally attractive energy. At a time of increased energy anxiety, the shale gas revolution is both a major innovation and a formidable new addition to our energy supply. 
George Mitchell was certainly on to something.

Full Text 
TOKYO -- Officials at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power complex said late Thursday they had found radioactive groundwater just outside a troubled reactor building, capping a day of uncertainty that saw Japan's prime minister question the country's pursuit of nuclear power. 
In a brief statement, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the plant's operator, said a test of groundwater conducted the previous day at the site revealed radioactive iodine-131 -- a common isotope found there since it was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 -- at levels 10,000 times the limit Japan sets for seawater. 
A Tepco spokesman said shortly after the statement was released that the reading may have been in error and would be reviewed and re-released Friday. That echoed a similar moment last weekend in which the company released radiation readings from around the plant only to amend them down several orders of magnitude, exposing it to a government reprimand. 
Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan questioned the role of nuclear technology and private power companies in Japan's energy policy. His comments, though lacking in detail, suggest a potential major setback for power companies and nuclear-plant manufacturers. 
Mr. Kan said Japan must review its long-term energy policy, one that relies heavily on nuclear power as a way to meet the nation's commitment to slash oil consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. In an ambitious policy blueprint unveiled just last year, Japan had said it planned to build 14 new nuclear reactors by 2030, adding to the existing 
54. 
"Human wisdom has made it possible to generate energy from nuclear power. But we have also allowed a huge accident like this to happen," Mr. Kan said. 
He raised the possibility that Japan would take a greater role in nuclear-power operation. His comments, delivered in Tokyo at a press conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, appeared to take direct aim at Tepco, the subject of recent speculation that it could be nationalized. "Once this crisis is brought under control, we need to have discussions on how our power companies should look, including whether they should continue to exist," he said. 
Documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal this week showed Tepco had a bare-bones plan in place to deal with disaster at the site, which was approved by Japanese regulators. 
Tepco and industry officials couldn't be reached Thursday night to comment. 
The prime minister's apparent skepticism about Japan's nuclear ambitions will raise questions about the resource-poor country's ability to compete with the likes of China for supplies of coal, natural gas or other power sources. It could also raise questions about Japan's ability to meet its international obligations to reduce global-warming emissions. 
Tepco released few details Thursday on its groundwater measurement. A Tepco spokesman said the sample had been taken just beyond the cement containment foundation of reactor No. 1 at a depth of about 15 meters. After contamination has been reported in sea water and in small amounts in some tap water, it would mark the first report of contamination in groundwater. 
The Fukushima Daiichi plants are built on the shore. Groundwater beneath appears to be linked to tidal flows. 
It was unclear how contamination in water beneath the plant could spread or where it came from -- whether from airborne particles brought down by rain, from runoff from the cooling water sprayed at No. 1 and other reactors, or from radiation possibly leaking out of the unit itself. 
The Tepco spokesman who offered details on the test said water couldn't leak into the ground directly from the reactor unit, since it sits on a bed of concrete that is built on solid rock. 
Earlier Thursday, Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said a reading taken in the sea just off the complex the previous day showed levels of radioactive iodine at 4,385 times the permitted level, up from 3,355 times on Tuesday. He said the rise could possibly be due to a continuous leak of highly radioactive material from the area around the crippled reactors. 
Also Thursday, government and Tepco workers at the power plant failed for the second straight day to pump out water that has flooded the foundations of three reactor buildings and threatens to spill out toward the ocean if it rises much more. Workers were in the process of moving water around the plant to free up space to drain potential spillover from underground shafts that surface only a short distance from the coastline. 
Separately, chief government spokesman Yukio Edano said Thursday the government has no plans to change its 12-mile evacuation zone for now but will beef up monitoring of radiation levels in affected areas. 
His comments followed a statement from the International Atomic Energy Agency that one of its teams had detected radiation from cesium-137 that is double their recommended limit in the town of Iitate, about 24 miles northwest of the Daiichi plant. The IAEA said the sampling was done from March 18-26 in nine municipalities and that the readings in other areas were within permissible levels. "If there are potential health effects over the long term, we may have to consider expanding the evacuation area," Mr. Edano said. 
The U.S. is also winding down its ground forces' support of relief efforts headed by Japan's military. "The humanitarian assistance piece of this mission is almost completed," Maj. Gen. Mark Brilakis, who has led ground-based forces in the relief operation, said Thursday. 
Kosaku Narioka, Kenneth Maxwell and William Sposato contributed to this article. 
Reactor No. 3 Operations to pump water from a nearby building and shaft -- before it overflows and risks running to the sea-- have yet to begin. How far water can rise in shaft before it overflows: 1.5 meters Level on Monday: 1.5 meters Reactor No. 2 Pumping operations have yet to begin to clear water that has collected here, which is more highly radioactive than similar pools at other reactors. How far water can rise before overflow: 1 meter Level on Monday: 1 meter Reactor No. 1 Radioactive groundwater was found nearby. Workers were hampered in efforts to remove water that flooded a building and threatens to spill into the ocean. How far water can rise before overflow: 1.1 meter Level on Monday: 0.1 meter Other developments: Tepco said it plans to build temporary water storage tanks and ponds and a water-processing facility to prevent spilling of contaminated water to the sea. A spokesman said 
Tepco hopes that by mid-April it will have built tanks with a total capacity of 6,000 tons and storage ponds with a capacity of 4,000 tons. Source: Tokyo Electric Power; Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency; DJ and WSJ reporting Credit: By Mitsuru Obe and Yuka Hayashi

Abstract 
Consider credit instruments during the financial crisis, the global warming debate, or global epidemics. [...] an earthquake and tsunami, even in technologically advanced Japan, can kill tens of thousands, wipe out entire villages, and re-open questions about nuclear power. 

Full Text 
We have more information at our fingertips than all previous generations combined, yet we're relying on records kept by Japanese monks in the year 869 to understand the impact of the undersea earthquake turned tsunami turned nuclear power-plant fiasco. 
Those monastic records are the only surviving account of the last such powerful earthquake rupturing along this plate boundary, according to U.S. Geological Survey earthquake specialist Dave Applegate. Its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire has long made Japan one of the most earthquake-prone places on earth, but even so, no one thought to build its nuclear power plants to the specifications based on the accounts of monks more than a millennium ago. 
The plants were therefore built to withstand quakes of a magnitude 8.2, not the 9.0 that struck earlier this month. The difference sounds small, but given the logarithmic scale, this represents a 15-fold increase in force. The Japanese pride themselves on their engineering expertise, and despite the horrific scenes and leaked radiation, the engineering seems to have been fine. The plants would have withstood expected earthquakes and tsunamis. It was the assumptions about the risks of what might happen that turned out to have been faulty. 
In this information-saturated era, we expect no surprises. Yet we are constantly surprised. We have huge amounts of data, so we assume that risks can be calculated and avoided. But we also have exceedingly complex systems. Just as weather is too hard to predict more than a few days out because of how many variables interact, it's hard to predict other complex systems. Consider credit instruments during the financial crisis, the global warming debate, or global epidemics. Thus an earthquake and tsunami, even in technologically advanced Japan, can kill tens of thousands, wipe out entire villages, and re-open questions about nuclear power. 
We no longer believe in social engineering because we accept that human foibles make it hard to predict manmade outcomes. Physical science was supposed to be different. In 1974, when the social sciences aspired to the apparent certainties of the hard sciences, Friedrich Hayek gave a lecture called "The Pretence of Knowledge," on the occasion of receiving the Nobel Prize in Economics. Hayek, the Austrian-born University of Chicago economist, made points that in retrospect help explain why tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes are more common than people expect. 
"Unlike the position that exists in the physical sciences, in economics and other disciplines that deal with essentially complex phenomena, the aspects of the events to be accounted for about which we can get quantitative data are necessarily limited and may not include the important ones," he said. That makes it impossible to produce simple and reliable forecasts. 
Hayek was not addressing nuclear power in particular, but his broader lesson helps put the Japanese events in context. "In the physical sciences it is generally assumed, probably with good reason, that any important factor which determines the observed events will itself be directly observable and measurable," he said. That is because the "great and rapid advance of the physical sciences took place in fields where it proved that explanation and prediction could be based on laws which accounted for the observed phenomena as functions of comparatively few variables -- either particular facts or relative frequency of events. This may even be the ultimate reason why we single out these realms as 'physical.'" 
But at least some physical systems turn out to be so complex that they resemble unpredictable social sciences more than the certainties of simpler physical science. 
In short, should we be more fearful because the engineering at the Japanese nuclear facilities worked as planned, or because the plan assumed more predictability than was possible? 
For social sciences such as economics, Hayek warned against "the belief that we possess the knowledge and the power which enable us to shape the processes of society entirely to our liking, knowledge which in fact we do not possess." He said that in the physical sciences, "there may be little objection to trying to do the impossible; one might even feel that one ought not to discourage the overconfident because their experiments may after all produce some new insights." 
Technological advances such as nuclear power have risks, but we learn from them. More recently constructed nuclear plants have cooling systems that would have prevented or limited the damage. It's hard to remember in times of crisis, but the safety record of nuclear power is strong. Nuclear power has killed many fewer people in accidents than have coal mines, yet no one is panicking over coal mines. 
Still, we fear what we cannot predict. This makes newer innovations such as nuclear power constant targets. It goes against the spirit of the age to accept that some systems are so complex that we cannot predict how they behave. We need to learn how to live with both new technologies and new uncertainties.

What GE Was Thinking in 2011

Abstract 
Discussion: GE's legal position, as maker of the failed reactors, is exceptionally strong, based on long-standing immunities in Japanese and international law pertaining to builders of nuclear plants. 

Full Text 
The following memo was unearthed as part of the litigation, now entering its 50th year, over the Great Japan Nuclear Incident of 2011. Addressed to General Electric's then-CEO Jeff Immelt, the memo appears to have been drafted by an executive in the company's office of strategy. 
Plan: Sell Nuclear Business to Comcast. 
Discussion: GE's legal position, as maker of the failed reactors, is exceptionally strong, based on long-standing immunities in Japanese and international law pertaining to builders of nuclear plants. Likewise, the outlook for the nuclear business, despite the Japanese setback, is currently excellent based on widespread concern about global warming. 
Thinking outside the box, however, we believe therefore it is time for GE to exit the nuclear business. We apply the new operational discipline enunciated by CEO Immelt in late 2008. To quote the CEO: "Assume a black swan!" 
First, liability. Whatever the law says, this accident will haunt us for a long time, perhaps expensively so. BP thought it was shielded by a U.S. law that strictly limited cleanup liability, and we all know what happened -- BP was pressured to deliver up an extralegal settlement of $20 billion to politicians, no strings attached. Heed should also be paid to Japan's relentless criminal pursuit of Mitsubishi Fuso executives, including the company's president, over a truck accident that killed a single person. Management is certainly aware that we've been stymied in selling our latest reactor designs in India by a new local law that extends liability from plant operators to equipment suppliers (i.e., us) despite international agreements and precedents to the contrary. For that matter, remember the headache when GOPers in Congress wanted to put us (!) on the hook for any nuclear accidents in North Korea from reactors we would have sold as part of a Clinton plan to bribe Pyongyang to give up its atomic bomb program. 
On Japanese blogs, wiseacres already are referring to our 1960s-era reactor design as the "third nuclear attack on Japan," sniping that conveniently ignores our local partner, Hitachi. But this too poses a problem: Companies in Japan do not stand on their legal rights but follow the direction of politicians, who may find it useful to require Hitachi and other nuclear contractors to accept blame. 
Point Two concerns the future commercial prospects of the GE-Hitachi nuclear business. As you know, GE's long-range forecasting unit (recently renamed the Office of Black Swan Awareness) recently concluded that public concern over global warming is exogenous, i.e., unrelated to any progress on scientific understanding of climate processes. What's more, as measured in polls, public concern is indicated to decline in coming years on moderating global temperature trends and Al Gore's divorce. 
None of us at GE needs to be reminded that there is no natural "private" market for nuclear reactors. All our customers are governments, government-owned companies, or nominally private companies regulated by government. In the U.S., demand for reactors depends on the availability of federal loan guarantees and the Price-Anderson nuclear indemnity law (private insurance being unavailable for nuclear reactors). 
Politics thus being the mother's milk of the nuclear business, GE's Institute of Ecomagination (aka our Washington lobbying shop) highlights a disturbing new correlation: Whenever President Obama endorses an energy option, disaster promptly ensues. His ringing support of expanded offshore drilling came just weeks before the BP oil spill. The Japanese reactor mess followed not long after he lauded nuclear energy as a weapon to fight global warming. 
On the site Politico.com, George Mason University political scientist Jeremy Mayer recently opined: "I don't think Obama's cursed on energy policy, but this is a string of bad luck." 
We disagree. Though on the advice of PR we've stopped referring to it as the "Obama Black Swan Effect," this powerful yet mysterious indicator is too important to ignore. Accordingly, this office recommends a new corporate strategy: Whatever Mr. Obama says, GE should do the opposite, starting with investing in coal-burning power-plants and health care reprivatization. 
This, of course, would represent a 180-degree reversal of current GE strategy, informally known around headquarters as the "jump how high?" strategy. This office nevertheless believes the evidence warrants such a change in direction.

Abstract 
In a letter Monday to Republican congressional leaders, senior Democrats on a House panel that oversees the NRC noted that the commission recently voted to renew an operating license for a Vermont nuclear plant they said is of the same basic design as some of the troubled Japanese reactors. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Obama administration officials Monday brushed aside calls for a freeze on new U.S. nuclear-power development, and sought to reassure the public the nation's 
nuclear facilities are safe and the threat of harmful radiation reaching U.S. soil from Japan is minimal. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. was sending more technical experts to Japan to get more information about the damaged nuclear reactors there as Japanese crews scrambled to prevent 
meltdowns at the facilities. 

As of Monday morning, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had two technical experts in Tokyo, said Gregory Jaczko, the NRC chairman. 
The Japanese also requested equipment from the U.S. to help cool the reactors damaged in last Friday's earthquake and tsunami. 
Mr. Jaczko said U.S. authorities don't have "detailed information" about the problem afflicting the reactors. 
He added, however, that "it is a situation in which there has been a loss of the normal type of cooling mechanisms to the reactor." 
The damage done to Japanese nuclear facilities has given new ammunition to critics of nuclear power just as the industry and many of its supporters in Washington were hoping 

for a revival of U.S. nuclear power as an alternative to coal-fired electricity generation. 

The Obama administration has said it wants to speed construction of nuclear-power facilities. The push is one element of iong to part of a broader strategy to support sources of 
energy that emit little or no carbon dioxide or other gases linked to climate change. 
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that Mr. Obama continued to support nuclear power, and that the administration would incorporate lessons from the Japanese 

accident into regulations. 

But some in Mr. Obama's party want to evaluate the U.S. nuclear industry's safety practices and record in light of the crisis in Japan. Some lawmakers have proposed a halt to 
new nuclear construction. 
In a letter Monday to Republican congressional leaders, senior Democrats on a House panel that oversees the NRC noted that the commission recently voted to renew an 

operating license for a Vermont nuclear plant they said is of the same basic design as some of the troubled Japanese reactors. 
"We hope the nuclear industry's self-confidence is warranted, but we should not accept the industry's assurances without conducting our own independent evaluation of the risks 
posed by nuclear reactors in the United States and the preparedness of industry and regulators to respond to those risks," wrote the lawmakers, led by Rep. Henry Waxman (D., 
Calif.). 

U.S. officials also sought to reassure the public that American nuclear facilities are safe and played down the likelihood of harmful radiation reaching the U.S. from Japan. 
It was "very unlikely" that harmful radiation levels from the damaged Japanese reactors would reach U.S. shores, Mr. Jaczko said during a White House briefing. 
"You just aren't going to have any radiological material that, by the time it traveled those large distances, could present any risk to the American public." 
Mr. Jaczko said the administration believes U.S. reactors continue to operate safely. 
"All our plants are designed to withstand significant natural phenomena like earthquakes, tornadoes and tsunamis," he said. 
When pressed whether they would be able to handle an earthquake of this scale and resulting tsunami, Mr. Jaczko said: "I don't want to speculate on anything like that at this 

point." 
The U.S. has 104 nuclear plants in 31 states. Together, they produce 20% of the nation's electricity. 
Even before the disaster in Japan, the U.S. nuclear industry's ambitious expansion plans were running into trouble. 
Natural gas has been so cheap that utilities have turned to it to generate electricity, rather than contemplate building multibillion-dollar reactors. 
Also, the recession also has damped demand for electrical power, further diminishing the appeal of investment in nuclear facilities.

Abstract 
[...] progressives in California -- which sits on its own prodigious oil supplies -- abhor drilling, promising green jobs while suffering double-digit unemployment, higher utility rates and the prospect of mind-numbing new regulations that are designed to combat global warming and are all but certain to depress future growth. Thanks to global demand, North Dakota's crop sales are strong, but they are no longer the dominant economic driver -- agriculture employs only 7.2% of the state's work force. 

Full Text 
Living on the harsh, wind-swept northern Great Plains, North Dakotans lean towards the practical in economic development. Finding themselves sitting on prodigious pools of oil -- estimated by the state's Department of Mineral Resources at least 4.3 billion barrels -- they are out drilling like mad. And the state is booming. 
Unemployment is 3.8%, and according to a Gallup survey last month, North Dakota has the best job market in the country. Its economy "sticks out like a diamond in a bowl of cherry pits," says Ron Wirtz, editor of the Minneapolis Fed's newspaper, fedgazette. The state's population, slightly more than 672,000, is up nearly 5% since 2000. 
The biggest impetus for the good times lies with energy development. Around 650 wells were drilled last year in North Dakota, and the state Department of Mineral Resources envisions another 5,500 new wells over the next two decades. Between 2005 and 2009, oil industry revenues have tripled to $12.7 billion from $4.2 billion, creating more than 13,000 jobs. 
Already fourth in oil production behind Texas, Alaska and California, the state is positioned to advance on its competitors. Drilling in both Alaska and the Gulf, for example, is currently being restrained by Washington-imposed regulations. And progressives in California -- which sits on its own prodigious oil supplies -- abhor drilling, promising green jobs while suffering double-digit unemployment, higher utility rates and the prospect of mind-numbing new regulations that are designed to combat global warming and are all but certain to depress future growth. In North Dakota, by contrast, even the state's Democrats -- such as Sen. Kent Conrad and former Sen. Byron Dorgan -- tend to be pro-oil. The industry services the old-fashioned liberal goal of making middle-class constituents wealthier. 
Oil also is the principal reason North Dakota enjoys arguably the best fiscal situation in all the states. With a severance tax on locally produced oil, there's a growing state surplus. Recent estimates put an extra $1 billion in the state's coffers this year, and that's based on a now-low price of $70 a barrel. 
North Dakota, however, is no one-note Prairie sheikdom. The state enjoys prodigious coal supplies and has -- yes -- even moved heavily into wind-generated electricity, now ranking ninth in the country. Thanks to global demand, North Dakota's crop sales are strong, but they are no longer the dominant economic driver -- agriculture employs only 7.2% of the state's work force. 
Perhaps more surprising, North Dakota is also attracting high-tech. For years many of the state's talented graduates left home, but that brain drain is beginning to reverse. This has been critical to the success of many companies, such as Great Plains Software, which was founded in the 1980s and sold to Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion. The firm has well over 1,000 employees. 
The corridor between Grand Forks and Fargo along the Red River (the border between North Dakota and Minnesota) has grown rapidly in the past decade. It now boasts the headquarters of Microsoft Business Systems and firms such as PacketDigital, which makes microelectronics for portable electronic devices and systems. There are also biotech firms such as Aldevron, which manufactures proteins for biomedical research. Between 2002 and 2009, state employment in science, technology, engineering and math-related professions grew over 30%, according to EMSI, an economic modeling firm. This is five times the national average. 
While the overall numbers are still small compared to those of bigger states, North Dakota now outperforms the nation in everything from the percentage of college graduates under the age of 45 to per-capita numbers of engineering and science graduates. Median household income in 2009 was $49,450, up from $42,235 in 2000. That 17% increase over the last decade was three times the rate of Massachussetts and more than 10 times that of California. 
Some cities, notably Fargo (population 95,000), have emerged as magnets. "Our parking lot has 20 license plates in it," notes Niles Hushka, co-founder of Kadrmas, Lee and Jackson, an engineering firm active in Great Plains energy development. Broadway Drive in Fargo's downtown boasts art galleries, good restaurants and young urban professionals hanging out in an array of bars. This urban revival is a source of great pride in Fargo. 
What accounts for the state's success? Dakotans didn't bet the farm, so to speak, on solar cells, high-density housing or high-speed rail. Taxes are moderate -- the state ranks near the middle in terms of tax per capita, according to the Tax Foundation -- and North Dakota is a right-to-work state, which makes it attractive to new employers, especially in manufacturing. But the state's real key to success is doing the first things first -- such as producing energy, food and specialized manufactured goods for which there is a growing, world-wide market. This is what creates the employment and wealth that can support environmental protection and higher education. 
Thankfully, this kind of sensible thinking is making a comeback in some other states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. These hard-pressed states realize that attending to basic needs -- in their case, shale natural gas -- could be just the elixir to resuscitate their economies.

EPA Tangles With New Critic: Labor

Abstract 
Companies that stand to benefit from tougher curbs on emissions from coal-fired power plants, including utilities that have invested heavily in wind, solar power and nuclear, are pushing the White House not to weaken the rules. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's environmental agenda, long a target of American business, is beginning to take fire from some of the Democratic Party's most reliable supporters: Labor unions. 
Several unions with strong influence in key states are demanding that the Environmental Protection Agency soften new regulations aimed at pollution associated with coal-fired power plants. Their contention: Roughly half a dozen rules expected to roll out within the next two years could put thousands of jobs in jeopardy and damage the party's 2012 election prospects. 
"If the EPA issues regulations that cost jobs in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Republicans will blast the President with it over and over," says Stewart Acuff, chief of staff to the president of the Utility Workers Union of America. "Not just the President. Every Democratic [lawmaker] from those states." 
A range of American companies that depend on fossil fuel -- from coal and oil firms to manufacturers -- have complained about the Obama EPA, one reason the administration has had tense relations with business. In meetings in recent days, representatives of electric power utilities that rely heavily on coal-fired plants, and some large unions, have taken their concerns to the White House. The companies and the unions have said a new regulation targeting mercury and other toxic pollutants, due to be proposed this week, could lead to higher electric bills, billions of dollars in new costs and the closing of plants that employ thousands of workers. 
Now that labor unions are joining the chorus, the pressure on the agency is intensifying. Some Democrats, worried about potential job losses in industrial states, are already urging the EPA to slow down its push to combat climate change. 
EPA officials say such criticisms are premature, since some of the rules in question have yet to be proposed, and that history shows the benefits of tougher environmental rules greatly outweigh the costs. 
But on some issues, the EPA has begun to slow the pace of its efforts, saying publicly that it needs more time to consider the science behind them or review comments from affected groups. 
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, or her top aide on air quality, Regina McCarthy, has recently spoken with representatives of several unions that collectively have given tens of millions of dollars over the years to Democratic candidates. Among them: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the Utility Workers Union and the United Mine Workers. 
The EPA rule stirring the most anxiety will be proposed this week: It seeks to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants, including mercury, which can cause neurological disorders in children. 
An analysis by the miners' union says the proposal, along with others targeting coal-related pollution, could put at risk as many as 250,000 jobs. Many of those would come from the utility, mining and railroad sectors, with the heaviest impact falling on Rust Belt states that have many old coal plants -- and electoral votes. 
"These are the same doomsday scenarios we hear whenever we take steps to protect Americans from dangerous air pollution," responded EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan. He said it's too early for the union to calculate possible job losses. A study released by the agency this month said EPA regulations put in place between 1990 and 2005 and aimed at reducing soot and smog will yield $2 trillion in benefits in 2020, largely from fewer premature deaths. 
"I think we have a really solid history of doing the rules in a way that makes sense," said Ms. McCarthy, the agency's assistant administrator for air and radiation. A White House spokesman says any proposed regulation will be consistent with a recent presidential order directing agencies to "consider regulatory approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility" while still protecting public health. 
Companies that stand to benefit from tougher curbs on emissions from coal-fired power plants, including utilities that have invested heavily in wind, solar power and nuclear, are pushing the White House not to weaken the rules. 
Chief executives of utilities that support stronger standards for coal-fired plants, including Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group Inc., Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc. and Chicago-based Exelon Corp., the nation's largest owner of nuclear-power plants, met last week with White House Chief of Staff William Daley. 
These companies, and some unions that see the rules as a potential economic catalyst, say that the industry has had years to prepare for tougher regulation and that the rules will generate jobs for workers who make, install or operate pollution control equipment. 
Under President Barack Obama, the EPA has been one of Washington's busiest agencies. Responding to a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Ms. Jackson has invoked the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other gases linked to climate change. Those moves have prompted lawsuits from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups. 
Ms. Jackson has also sought to tighten regulations covering traditional pollutants associated with coal. Some of her proposals have come in response to federal court decisions that invalidated regulations set under President George W. Bush. 
Nevertheless, the EPA has slowed its timetable for action on some issues in recent months. Ms. Jackson late last year delayed a decision on whether to tighten the government's limits on ground-level ozone, a primary ingredient in smog. A coalition of labor groups including Boilermakers, Mine Workers and Utility Workers warned her in a letter that tightening the standard would lead to "significant job losses across the country." A group of Democratic senators from Missouri, Indiana and Louisiana said in their own letter such a move would "have a significant negative impact on our states' workers." 
Ms. Jackson has said she delayed her decision not in response to pressure, but to ensure the regulation is grounded in "the best science." 
Last month, the EPA unveiled a scaled-back version of regulations it proposed last year targeting emissions of pollutants from industrial boilers after being deluged with letters and comments. 
The United Steelworkers said in an August letter that "tens of thousands" of jobs at factories whose employees are represented by the Steelworkers "will be imperiled" by the rule, along with other related jobs. 
A spokeswoman for the Steelworkers says the union hasn't fully assessed the new version of the rules. "We've been trying to work with the EPA . . . to get to a place where the rules are a bit more mindful of the costs," says Roxanne Brown, the union's assistant legislative director. 
The EPA said the rules will avert up to 6,600 premature deaths in 2014, while costing affected industries $2.1 billion a year, about half the cost of its initial proposal. 
Not all unions take a dim view of the EPA's moves. William Hite, general president of the United Association of Plumbers and Pipe Fitters, says that while his union is "certainly concerned" about the potential for job losses, the mercury rule could also create thousands of jobs for workers who build and install pollution control equipment. 
At the same time, a delicate alliance has emerged between the unions and companies wary of the EPA. In February, representatives of the Boilermakers union and the IBEW met in Washington with Mike Morris, the CEO of American Electric Power Co. AEP, of Columbus, Ohio, is one of the nation's top coal burners and stands to be among the companies hardest hit by tougher EPA rules. 
In January, Mr. Morris met with the president of the IBEW, Ed Hill, and the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, (R., Mich.). 
Rep. Upton, who has introduced legislation to strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, said in an interview that AEP's Mr. Morris requested the meeting, and that the three discussed concerns about the impact of new EPA regulations. 
The unions lobbying the EPA are longtime Democratic Party supporters. Through its employees and political action committee, the IBEW has given $32.9 million to federal candidates and political parties since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks campaign donations. 
Nearly all of that money went to Democrats, according to the center, which ranks the union as the seventh-biggest "heavy hitter" on a list of the 100 biggest givers in federal politics. 
Mr. Obama's relationship with organized labor, however, has been uneven. 
He initially lent his support in recent fights with Republican governors over public-sector collective bargaining, but avoided plunging into the fray. 
And while Mr. Obama has made many pro-union policy decisions and appointments, some union leaders remain disappointed that the White House didn't push harder for the "Employee Free Choice Act," a bill that would have made it easier for unions to organize. 
All this could come into play in 2012. Nine states Mr. Obama won in 2008 -- home to more than a fifth of Electoral College votes and a third of the country's greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants -- replaced Democratic statewide officeholders with Republicans in 2010. Four of those states have Democratic senators facing reelection in 2012, including Ohio, which relies on coal for more than 80% of its electricity. 
Greg Haas, a Democratic political strategist based in Columbus, and Jerry Austin, a Democratic political consultant based in Cleveland, say EPA regulations could determine which presidential candidate wins Ohio's critical electoral votes. 
"Environmental issues aren't going to be the No. 1 issue on the table, but they're going to be a factor with enough voters that in a tight election, it can tip the scales." Mr. Haas said. 
Mr. Haas said that while labor leaders would still support Democrats in next year's races, the EPA's actions could complicate the unions' efforts to generate enthusiasm and turnout among members. 
In the House, senior Democrats on the chamber's Agriculture and Transportation committees recently endorsed legislation to block EPA regulation of greenhouse gases. In the Senate, a group of Democrats led by Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia has introduced legislation that would forbid the EPA for two years from regulating greenhouse gases from power plants, and other stationary sources. 
Among those pushing the measure: Missouri's Claire McCaskill. Ms. McCaskill, a Democrat who is facing reelection next year, was among the senators who also complained in a joint letter last year about the EPA proposal to tighten the definition of unhealthy ozone levels. 
"The people in my state want clean air and clean water, but farmers and businesses in our state don't want nonsensical regulations that harm their ability to make a living," Ms. McCaskill said in an interview. 
The EPA has said tightening the standard would save thousands of lives and is "long overdue." 
The pending EPA proposal to limit mercury emissions stems from a long-running struggle between public-health groups and America's coal industry. Coal-fired power plants aren't currently subject to federal controls on their mercury emissions. Each year, they emit about 48 tons of mercury, a toxic element. 
Under President Bill Clinton, the EPA declared in 2000 that mercury emissions from power plants pose "significant hazards to public health" and must be reduced. During the George W. Bush administration, the EPA established a national cap for mercury emissions and permitted power plants running on coal or oil to purchase credits from less-polluting plants. 
In 2008, a federal court said the EPA's approach violated a requirement of federal law that power plants be outfitted with the best available antipollution technology. 
The EPA's Ms. Jackson, in response, began drafting a rule expected to give power plants three years to meet standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Owners would have to choose between buying new pollution equipment, switching to cleaner fuels or retiring the plant. 
The EPA's supporters say the new regulation will level the playing field between companies that have invested in pollution controls and those that haven't. The agency and its supporters also predict the rule will create jobs. 
"It will be the biggest public-health achievement of the Obama administration," says John Walke, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
But a report last September from bank Credit Suisse said the mercury rule, along with another regulation in the works targeting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, could lead to the closure of nearly 18% of the nation's coal-fired generation capacity, mainly facilities more than 40 years old that lack emissions controls. 
Unions, which have many members in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, want the EPA to base the new standards on the performances of different coal types. Many coal plants in the eastern U.S. rely on bituminous coal, which when burned emits higher levels of acid gases than sub-bituminous coal, commonly found in western states. The unions' approach would mean a slower timetable for reducing emissions, a trade-off many environmentalists are reluctant to accept. 
"We understand they have a legal obligation" to issue the rule, says Mr. Acuff, chief of staff of the utility-workers union. "But they also have an obligation to make sure that these regulations don't hurt the administration and workers."

Abstract 
[...] he said the explosion should reassure Americans that their own plants will be prepared for any emergency, because the industry will disseminate lessons learned in Japan around the globe, helping other reactors shore up their defenses against even devastating natural disasters, like the quake and the tsunami that followed. 

Full Text 
The U.S. nuclear power industry believed it was poised for a renaissance. 
President Obama's 2012 budget proposed $36 billion in loan guarantees to build nuclear power plants. He called, too, for spending hundreds of millions on nuclear energy research and modern reactor design. Powerful Republicans were on board, calling for expansion of nuclear power a rare opportunity for bipartisan cooperation. 
Then, the massive earthquake and resulting damage at two nuclear facilities in Japan occurred over the weekend. Industry experts and analysts at once began to ponder the political fallout in the U.S. 
The 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania froze the nuclear power industry in the U.S. No new licenses were granted for 30 years. The Three Mile incident ­
- sparked by the failure of a cooling system -- didn't cause any deaths, but many Americans were terrified by the plant's move to vent radioactive steam into the air and by ominous talk of a potential meltdown. 
The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl reinforced American skepticism of nuclear power. 
But in recent years, the industry has steadily chipped away at that wariness. Industry executives and their political allies promote nuclear power as "clean energy," because, unlike coal or natural gas, it doesn't produce the greenhouse gases linked to global warming. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is now reviewing 20 more license applications from a dozen companies seeking to produce nuclear power. Site preparations for new reactors have begun in Georgia and South Carolina, and plans are under way to finish a reactor that was started years ago but never completed in Tennessee. That reactor should come online in 2013, and those in South Carolina and Georgia are expected to begin operations in 2016. 
All told, the industry expects up to eight new reactors to be churning out power by 2020, according to Mitch Singer, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group. 
The U.S. currently has 104 nuclear plants in 31 states. Together, they produce 20% of the nation's electricity. 
Mr. Singer said he doesn't think the accident in Japan will derail the U.S. nuclear boom. In fact, he said the explosion should reassure Americans that their own plants will be prepared for any emergency, because the industry will disseminate lessons learned in Japan around the globe, helping other reactors shore up their defenses against even devastating natural disasters, like the quake and the tsunami that followed. 
"At this point," Mr. Singer said, "I don't think we're going to see a major impact on the U.S. nuclear industry." 
But Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, predicted Americans would respond to the Japanese disaster with "greatly heightened skepticism and heightened unwillingness to have nuclear power plants located in one's own neighborhood." 
He predicted as well greater regulatory scrutiny of existing nuclear plants that are seeking to extend their operating licenses, especially when those plants are located in seismically active zones, such as Southern California's San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station and Diablo Canyon Power Plant. 
"The image of a nuclear power plant blowing up before your eyes on the television screen is a first," Mr. Bradford said. "That cannot be good for an industry that's looking for votes in Congress and in the state legislatures." 
Mr. Obama's proposal to expand loan guarantees to aid construction of new reactors might also take a hit, especially given the push in Congress to cut spending, said Robert Alvarez, a former senior policy advisor for the U.S. Department of Energy who now works on nuclear disarmament issues. "There might be a political tsunami," Mr. Alvarez said. 
Within hours of the blast at the Japanese nuclear plant, Rep. Edward J. Markey, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called on the Obama administration to impose a moratorium on building new reactors in seismically active areas and to require those already in earthquake-prone zones to be retrofitted with stronger containment systems. He also called for a thorough investigation of whether design flaws contributed to the Japanese accident. Twenty three reactors in the U.S. use the same design parameters as Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. 
"The unfolding disaster in Japan must produce a seismic shift in how we address nuclear safety here in America," Rep. Markey said. 
Rep. Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas who has long supported nuclear power, said he hoped the damage to the reactor in Japan didn't turn the American public off nuclear energy. But he added that "even proponents of nuclear power want to get to the bottom" of what happened in Japan -- how to fix it. 
"I believe very strongly in the future of nuclear power," Mr. Burton said, "but those who support it have to insist that the safety redundancy features perform" even during a catastrophic natural disaster. 
Even before the explosion in Japan, economic reality had taken a bite out of the nuclear industry's ambitious expansion plans in the U.S. 
Natural gas has been so cheap that utilities have turned to it to generate electricity, rather than contemplate building multi-billion-dollar reactors. The recession has also dampened demand for electrical power, further diminishing the appeal of a massive investment in nuclear facilities.

Abstract 
Steven "Mac" Heller, executive chairman of Coda Automotive Inc., discussed electric vehicles; John Mackey, co-chief executive of Whole Foods Market inc., reviewed healthier food and wellness efforts; Kyle Danish, an environmental attorney at the law firm Van Ness Feldman, tackled coal; and Eric Spiegel, president and CEO of Siemens Corp., spoke about renewable energy. 

Full Text 
The world's population is booming -- and all those billions of people want the same standard of living that developed countries enjoy. Meeting that goal presents tremendous challenges. 
Attendees at the ECO:nomics conference split into groups to discuss the problems and potential solutions in different sectors. Following those meetings, executives reported back on the discussions. Steven "Mac" Heller, executive chairman of Coda Automotive Inc., discussed electric vehicles; John Mackey, co-chief executive of Whole Foods Market inc., reviewed healthier food and wellness efforts; Kyle Danish, an environmental attorney at the law firm Van Ness Feldman, tackled coal; and Eric Spiegel, president and CEO of Siemens Corp., spoke about renewable energy. 
Below are edited excerpts of their presentations. 
The Road to Electric Cars 
MR. HELLER: When we talk about electric vehicles, it's all about the battery. People were pretty positive on our ability to bring lithium-ion-battery-system costs down to a level where EVs will be cost-competitive with gasoline vehicles. It will take us a few years to do that, but here are the things we are going to need to happen in order for it to occur. We're going to need to move prototype volumes to mass volumes. There's a lot of great science going on optimizing the cell, optimizing the chemistry and optimizing the battery-management system, the computer software and hardware that controls power in, power out. 
On range, consumers have a menu of technologies from which they can choose. In my briefcase right now, I have a laptop, an iPad, a Kindle and two phones. To send a short email I'm going to use my BlackBerry, to read a book I'm going to use my Kindle, to see pictures I'm going to use my iPad. 
Consumers tell us that they think about their cars in the same way. The electric vehicle will be for 90% to 95% of driving days, and on the weekend when I want to go from Atherton to Yosemite, I'm going to use either a range-extended hybrid or a pure gasoline vehicle. So people were bullish on our ability, through the proliferation of technologies, to satisfy consumer anxiety about range. 
Our group had a high degree of trust in the GEs, etc., of the world and the utility companies to generate enough power, distribute enough power, make enough power available for people to charge at home, at stores, at work and along the interstate highway system. 
It will take some money, it will take a little more technology, and it will take a higher degree of EVs on the road to get there, but people thought that was going to happen. 
Heading for Wellness 
MR. MACKEY: I sort of ended up hijacking the meeting and talked about what I was interested in, which was how we're choosing foods that are higher in fat, more animal foods, more sugar, more salt, less nutritious -- that correlates with the type of lifestyle diseases that are killing us. Heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases are largely diseases that are caused through our lifestyle choices. 
We talked about how, in a sense, as countries become more affluent, as they have more money, they are tending to make choices very similar to Western diet choices. They're eating far more animal foods. The amount of animal foods consumed in the world has quadrupled in the last 50 years. They are making choices for more processed foods, more sugar, more soft drinks, more candy. And the diseases that correlate with that type of dietary consumption are also migrating to the developing world, and we're starting to see those rates go up as well. 
So then we talked a lot about what Whole Foods is doing to educate our customers, how we're creating Wellness Clubs to try to get people to make conscious choices about their food to make themselves healthier. 
We talked about how Whole Foods is taking 1,000 of our team members now and putting them through an intensive Total Health Immersion Program, and how transformative that has been in their lives, and how that's beginning to lower our health-care costs as we're creating a culture of wellness, which we think probably is exportable to other corporations. 
Cleaning Up Coal 
MR. DANISH: There was a discussion of the need for a longer-term plan for the energy sector for users of coal, the United States and globally, that would allow for some rational transition from older coal plants to natural gas to other forms of electricity. 
There was a good bit of discussion about efficiency and interest in finding new models for utilities in the U.S. to partner with their customers to promote efficiency. There was a good discussion about the public perception of coal and coal-fired electricity, and a need for the public to better understand those elements, including just how much of their electricity comes from coal and that the transition away from coal is not cheap and that clean coal is not cheap. 
But, importantly, there was a discussion also about how utilities need to also better understand that many companies are not indifferent to where their electricity comes from, are concerned about embedded carbon in the energy they use, and are going to be increasingly discriminating in this regard. 
We did a good bit of discussion about China, making the point here that while there is some perception that China is just building a creaky old coal-fired power plant a week using 1950s technology, it's not at all the case. They're using the most efficient, modern advanced technology. That is an area that we can learn from. 
A lot of the discussion also was about the unsettled policy landscape domestically and internationally, that we may not have a global, comprehensive approach to dealing with climate change, and whether there is potential for smaller-scale efforts. 
A Windy Future? 
MR. SPIEGEL: Given where we are with the amount of natural gas in the country and the cost of natural-gas generation, renewables over some short period of time had to become competitive with gas. 
From a Siemens perspective, some of our wind projects are already competitive with gas in some areas where there's high-cost power on the margin and where we have a very windy area. We then talked about the enablers that are going to be needed if we wanted to expand wind on a much bigger basis, which would be around transmission, a smarter grid and also some answer to the energy-storage question. 
We also talked about solar. The discussion was that that's probably a longer-term opportunity than wind. Quite a few projects ongoing, but they're heavily subsidized, and the question is, "What's the timing when those things will become economic?" I'm not clear that people think that those are going to be winners as fast as wind may be. 
Then we talked a little bit about the other stream around renewables, which is really transportation and the shift away from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels like biofuels and maybe some products made from algae and things. 
Four or five years ago people would have thought biofuels moving from corn-based to cellulosic would have a much bigger impact. There wasn't a lot of excitement yet around that. 
On the other hand, there was a lot of discussion around Brazil and the model that they put in place to shift their transportation sector more toward sugarcane-based biofuels and how successful that had been, and is there an opportunity to do something like that here in the U.S. and/or relax tariffs and things to import it. 
We also talked a little bit about cities. It was clear that there's just not the excitement here that we see in other parts of the world around connecting things like renewable energy, networks, mobility and things in cities, as cities become more crowded and congested.

Abstract 
By reducing taxes on something we want more of (income, payroll) and shifting the tax onto something we want less of (pollution), we could bring accountability to the marketplace, and free enterprise could deliver better products that would beat the grandfathered fossil fuels. Since carbon emitted in Beijing and New Delhi has the same impact on our global environment as carbon emitted in Boston and New York, Mr. Blinder's "miracle cure" would have no impact on the environment. 

Full Text 
Alan S. Blinder's miracle cure is in real terms a transition to a high-cost noncompetitive economy in the U.S., while China, India, Russia and the rest of the world retain their economies based on low-cost coal and oil ("The Carbon Tax Miracle Cure," op-ed, Jan. 31). They will eat our lunch and our jobs, too, if this plan is adopted. Considering the cost of green energy, there is no conceivable level of innovation and ingenuity that would make such an economy competitive with one based on oil and coal. 
Prof. Blinder speaks as if the effect of CO2 on the world's climate is a universally accepted principle. It is not. The more we learn about the queasy science that underlies this hypothesis, the less acceptable it is becoming. 
A far better solution for our energy problems would be to vastly increase domestic oil, gas, coal and nuclear-energy production by removing excessive regulation and green obstructionism. 
Robert F. Amos 
Point Clear, Ala. 
While the best long-range solution to the problem may well involve renewable sources like wind, solar and nuclear, the economics and the politics are not favorable for that in the near-to-medium term. In the meantime, we have huge domestic supplies of natural gas, a clean energy source to which vehicles and power plants could be adapted at relatively attractive cost. American natural gas would provide an immediate practical bridge to the "perfect" solution. 
G. Michael Hostage 
Vero Beach, Fla. 
Alan Blinder makes a good case for a phased-in carbon tax. Conservatives could support a carbon tax if it's offset by corresponding reductions in payroll or income taxes, or if it is accompanied by a rebate or dividend of 100% of the tax collected. We insist on revenue-neutrality because of a firm belief that government needs to be shrunk, not grown, and because it's the only way to gain acceptance of a smart economic policy that's an easy target of populist demagoguery. 
Prof. Blinder smartly points out that the unrecognized negative externalities of fossil fuels (their hidden national security costs and health/environmental costs) allow them to win in a rigged competition with new energy technologies. 
Somewhere along the way we stopped cheering President George W. Bush's call to "break the addiction to oil" and started chanting, "Drill, baby, drill." What President Bush, the oil man, knew is that we've got 3% of the world's proven oil reserves and OPEC has 70%. It's conservative to change the game. 
By reducing taxes on something we want more of (income, payroll) and shifting the tax onto something we want less of (pollution), we could bring accountability to the marketplace, and free enterprise could deliver better products that would beat the grandfathered fossil fuels. 
Bob Inglis 
Travelers Rest, S.C. 
Mr. Inglis is a former Republican congressman from South Carolina. 
Is the U.S. alone to sacrifice because of the fear of global climate change? China is gobbling up mines, oil and gas all over the world with not a thought about climate change. Even as the U.S. tries to get away from coal, the Chinese are buying our coal to burn in their country. China gives only lip service to climate change as it manufactures the solar panels and wind-power equipment it sells to us. 
Virginia Bryce 
Camarillo, Calif. 
Mr. Blinder's proposed massive tax increase on CO2 emissions is a prescription that offers the American people all pain and no gain. It would just shift carbon emissions from the U.S. (by shutting down industries and increasing unemployment) and relocate the emissions to China, India and other booming economies that are gobbling up American jobs. Since carbon emitted in Beijing and New Delhi has the same impact on our global environment as carbon emitted in Boston and New York, Mr. Blinder's "miracle cure" would have no impact on the environment. A medical doctor offering a "cure" like this would surely be sued for malpractice. 
Charles T. Drevna 
President 
National Petrochemical & Refiners Association 
Washington 
Alan Blinder says that, "The next Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are waiting in the wings to make themselves rich by helping the environment." The next generation of entrepreneurs is surely out there. But are its members waiting for government industrial policy to tell them what to do? More likely, the real innovators are waiting for the government to get out of the way. 
Michael Davis 
Dallas 
I see no mention in Prof. Blinder's article of corresponding cuts in government spending to decrease the deficit. This sounds like a new money stream for our politicians to spend. 
Prof. Blinder says the carbon tax will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. How about drilling for our own oil and employing Americans to drill. Let's keeps the money here. 
He says his tax won't make us like France. Here I agree with the professor. I think Spain would be a better model. It has already been down the green-energy path and has embraced the concept of global warming. Last I read, Spain has 18% unemployment and a government struggling to stay solvent. 
John McKinney 
Raleigh, N.C. 
Taxes create artificial incentives that misdirect capital formation from productive market applications. Show me one example where taxation has led to the growth of new industry. Mr. Blinder ignores the law of unintended consequences.

Abstract 
"Petitioners have no standing," the company's court filing argued, adding that greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change are "geopolitical issues" beyond the jurisdictional scope of their appeal.

LONGVIEW, Wash. -- A battle over a proposed coal export terminal on the Columbia River has taken on a global dimension, as opponents say local officials have to consider the potential environmental harm when the U.S. fuel is burned at its destination -- in China. 
Making this argument is "a core strategy in the fight against a huge expansion of the fossil-fuel economy," said Ross Macfarlane of Seattle-based Climate Solutions, one of the groups that want the terminal project stopped. 
Terminal critics also say the potential environmental damage from mining the material in Montana and Wyoming hasn't been adequately assessed. 
Local officials reject both arguments. "Environmental groups are treading new ground here, there is no guidance from the state of Washington on how to approach this," said Mike Wojtowicz, an official in Cowlitz County, which gave construction approval for the project. 
U.S. coal companies are looking for a better way to export to Asia, as there are now no major coal exporting facilities on the U.S. West Coast. Washington state, with its proximity to coal-rich Wyoming and Montana, is seen as the best place to start. 
In November, Millennium Bulk Terminals LLC, a unit of Australia-based Ambre Energy Ltd., purchased the site of a former Alcoa Inc. aluminum smelter in Longview. Millennium plans to spend $100 million on the coal terminal, which local officials hope will bring 125 construction jobs and 75 permanent positions to Longview, a former sawmill hub where unemployment last year topped 12%. 
Following Cowlitz County's approval for the terminal, the next step is the state's Shoreline Hearings Board, where a rejection is being sought by a coalition of environmental groups, including Climate Solutions, Earthjustice, the Sierra Club and the Washington Environmental Council. In late December the Washington state attorney general intervened on the side of the environmentalists, joining the state's Department of Ecology in challenging the county's development plans. The Shoreline Hearings Board will take up the matter April 11. 
Millennium moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition in January. "Petitioners have no standing," the company's court filing argued, adding that greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change are "geopolitical issues" beyond the jurisdictional scope of their appeal. 
"There's something troubling about a foreign corporation stating that Washington residents don't have access to Washington courts to enforce Washington laws to prevent harm from climate change." said Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman. 
Companies in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming mine about 500 million tons of coal a year, selling mainly to domestic utilities that increasingly are turning to cleaner, lower-cost natural gas. Coal producers are watching the Longview dispute as they seek to ship more to China, where demand is growing rapidly. 
In 2010, the U.S. exported about 80 million tons of coal, mainly from the East Coast and Gulf Coast, according to industry analysts, who project total U.S. seaborne coal exports will grow about 10% this year. While U.S. coal exports to China are still a small part of the total, they shot up to more than four million tons last year from just over a million in 2009. 
The Millennium terminal would handle five million tons of coal a year after construction is completed sometime in 2012, according to the company. 
Arch Coal Inc. of St. Louis, the nation's second-largest coal producer, bought a 38% stake in the proposed Longview coal terminal earlier this month. Arch hopes to start shipping coal mined in Wyoming through the Longview terminal starting in 2012. 
Arch already is exporting Powder River Basin coal through Vancouver, British Columbia, to China and India, said Steve Leer, Arch's chief executive. He said Arch expected exports to rise to 20% of sales in 20 years, compared with 5% now. "I actually think the next decade for coal is going to be one of the best decades we've ever had," he said. 
Peabody Energy Corp., the biggest U.S. coal producer, also is trying to secure a West Coast facility to ship 20-25 million tons of coal to Asia. "China and other nations will use more coal," said Vic Svec, a senior vice president at Peabody. "The question is: can U.S. jobs and the U.S. economy benefit?" 
While there is little West Coast port capacity to export coal, space is particularly hard to come by in Washington, with some facilities refusing to entertain coal as a cargo customer because of strong environmental opposition. Tara Mattina, spokeswoman for the Port of Tacoma, said her facility was pitched by at least two coal exporters looking for access to Asia-bound freighters. Tacoma turned both down. "We just didn't think it would be a good fit for us," Ms. Mattina said. 
Joe Cannon, chief executive of Millennium, said coal shipped through Longview would likely burn more cleanly, with fewer sulfur and mercury emissions, than most of the coal China burns for electricity. 
Limiting exports based on related greenhouse-gas emissions is problematic to coal executives like Mr. Cannon, who pointed out that wheat shipped through a grain export terminal now under construction in Longview will contribute to the emission of methane overseas from the cattle who consume it there. 
"We can go down the slippery slope of these hypotheticals until the cows come home and eat the grain and produce the methane," said Mr. Macfarlane of Climate Solutions. "But the bottom line is the coal transported in this facility would be more coal than is used and burned in the state of Washington."

Abstract 
[...] it would eventually reduce the federal budget deficit significantly. [...] while the CO2 tax should be enacted now, it should be set at zero for 2011 and 2012. 

Full Text 
In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama called for a major technological push for cleaner energy: "the Apollo projects of our time." But when the details emerge, it is predictable that his political foes will object to the new government spending and decry the "heavy hand" of government in telling business what to do. Fortunately, there is a marvelous way to square the circle. 
Under this policy approach, decision-making is left in private hands and the jobs created will be in the private sector. Furthermore, the policy would not cost taxpayers a dime. In fact, it would eventually reduce the federal budget deficit significantly. Plus, there are a few nice side effects, like reducing our trade deficit, making our economy more efficient, ameliorating global warming, and showing the world that American capitalism has not lost its edge. 
What is this miraculous policy? It's called a carbon tax -- really, a carbon dioxide tax -- but one that starts at zero and ramps up gradually over time. 
The timing is critical. With the recovery just starting -- we hope -- to gather steam, this is a terrible time to hit it with some big new tax. Hence, while the CO2 tax should be enacted now, it should be set at zero for 2011 and 2012. After that, it would ramp up gradually. Adapting some calculations from a recent paper by Prof. William Nordhaus of Yale, the tax might start at something like $8 per ton of CO2 in 2013 (that's roughly eight cents per gallon of gasoline), reach $25 a ton by 2015 (still just 26 cents per gallon), $40 by 2020, and keep on rising. I'd like to see it top out at more than $200 a ton in, say, 2040 -- which is higher than in Mr. Nordhaus's example. 
But the time pattern is more important than the exact dates and numbers. What's critical is that we lock in higher future costs of carbon today. The key thing, as the president said, is that "businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling." 
Think about what would happen. Once America's entrepreneurs and corporate executives see lucrative opportunities from carbon-saving devices and technologies, they will start investing right away -- and in ways that make the most economic sense. I don't know whether all this innovation will lead to 80% of our electricity being generated by clean energy sources in 2035, which is the president's goal. But I can hardly wait to witness the outpouring of ideas it would unleash. The next Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are waiting in the wings to make themselves rich by helping the environment. 
Jobs follow investment, and we need jobs now. Even if our economy manages 4% growth for several years in a row, unemployment is destined to remain high for years. We have become accustomed to grading stimulus programs on their "bang for the buck." The 2009 Recovery Act, for example, was expected to cost $90,000-$100,000 for each job created. The "bang for the buck" from a phased-in carbon tax would be infinite at first: lots of jobs at zero cost to the federal budget. 
Furthermore, many of the new jobs will be good jobs with good wages. It is probably true, as some critics say, that much of the resulting manufacturing activity will move offshore -- eventually. But not necessarily right away. And besides, many of the best jobs -- in design, sales, marketing and executive positions -- will remain in the U.S. 
Using Mr. Nordhaus's tax rates as an illustration, the tax would begin to bring in revenue starting in 2013 -- a trickle at first but building. Mr. Nordhaus estimates $123 billion in annual tax revenue in 2015 and $282 billion by 2025. If we eventually hit a $200 per ton tax rate, the tax yield would be close to 2% of GDP. 
No one likes to pay higher taxes. But every realistic observer knows that closing our humongous federal budget deficit will require a mix of higher taxes and lower spending as shares of GDP. Forget about value-added taxes and other new levies you may have heard about. A CO2 tax trumps them all. 
Among the major benefits is that a carbon tax would reduce oil imports. Everyone knows that we import too much oil -- even if we ignore the fact that much of what we pay for it goes to countries that are not exactly friendly to us. In recent years, our imports of energy-related petroleum products have accounted for nearly two-thirds of our overall trade deficit in goods and services. 
Everyone also knows that CO2 emissions are the major cause of global climate change, that climate change poses a clear and present danger to our planet, and that the U.S. contributes a huge share of global emissions. Up to now, our country has done approximately nothing to curb CO2 emissions. A stiff tax would make a world of difference. Let's remember that even a tax of $200 per ton 30 years from now won't turn us into France. (A carbon tax would have very large effects on the cost of energy generated by burning coal, but essentially none on the costs of nuclear, solar, or wind-generated energy.) 
I know this sounds like a pipe dream now. America has elected a Republican House of Representatives that, among its first acts, decided that tax increases don't really add revenue and that tax cuts don't really lose revenue -- at least not any revenue they are willing to count. These folks are not about to vote for a CO2 tax, even one starting at zero. 
But let's remember Winston Churchill's marvelous aphorism: "You can always count on Americans to do the right thing -- after they've tried everything else." First, we'll try everything else. But eventually we'll succumb to the inexorable logic of a phased-in CO2 tax. Just watch -- if you're young enough to live that long.

Cap and Trade Returns From the Grave

Abstract 
The goal of cap and trade is to impose crushing taxes on fossil fuels -- oil, coal, natural gas -- thereby forcing utilities to switch to costly renewables. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has noodled with legislation to require an energy standard that includes nuclear energy (like that produced in his home state) along with renewables. 

Full Text 
Cap and trade is dead. Long live cap and trade. 
The president presented his new, conciliatory face to the nation this week, and his State of the Union was as notable for what it didn't include as what it did. He uttered not one word about global warming, a comprehensive climate bill, or his regulatory attempts to reduce carbon. Combined with his decision to give the axe to controversial climate czar Carol Browner, political analysts took all this as further proof that Barack Obama was moving to the middle, making nice with Republicans. 
Snort. Guffaw. Chortle. 
Listen carefully to Mr. Obama's speech and you realize he spent plenty of it on carbon controls. He just used a different vocabulary. If the president can't get carbon restrictions via cap and trade, he'll get them instead with his new proposal for a "clean energy" standard. Clean energy, after all, sounds better to the public ear, and he might just be able to lure, or snooker, some Republicans into going along. 
The official end of cap and trade, and Mrs. Browner, wasn't conciliation -- it was necessity. The public now understands that cap and trade is an economy killer, and no small number of Democrats lost their seats in midterms for supporting it. Few in the party want to take it up again, and House Republicans won't let it pass. Mr. Obama would be crazy to continue calling for it. 
Mrs. Browner, for her part, had become a political liability. As czar, she's had sweeping control over administration policy -- all of it unaccountable. This worked under a Democratic Congress, but House Republicans had made clear they intended to call her to testify. This had the makings of an ugly fight over executive privilege and would have forced the White House to defend a lack of transparency. Better to let the lightning rod go. 
But Mr. Obama has no intention of letting go of his carbon-free world. He instead went to plan B. Specifically, he called in his speech for the nation to "join" him in a "new goal: by 2035, 80% of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources." What the president was in essence calling for -- in happier, fuzzier, broader language -- is what policy wonks refer to as a "renewable portfolio standard." This is a government mandate requiring that utilities produce annually a specific amount of their electricity from renewable sources -- wind, solar, biofuels. 
It's also cap and trade by another name. Consider: The goal of cap and trade is to impose crushing taxes on fossil fuels -- oil, coal, natural gas -- thereby forcing utilities to switch to costly renewables. Under Mr. Obama's new proposal, the government skips the tax part and outright requires the use of costly renewables. The result is the same: dramatically higher energy prices, from carbon-free sources. Now you know why even climate warrior John Kerry was so sanguine about the president's failure to say "climate change" in his speech. "I'm very sympathetic," said the Massachusetts senator, who clearly got the strategy memo. 
Many Republicans understand the situation. Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, chair of House Energy and Commerce, put out a statement following the speech that insisted "the answer is not to hyper-subsidize preferred industries or to force consumers and job creators to purchase energy they can't afford." Reached on the phone, Mr. Upton elaborated, telling me the president's remarks "smell like cap and trade all over again." He noted that 28 states already have their own renewable standards and so "why have a federal mandate?" 
Then again, some Republicans -- the self-styled energy progressives -- have let it be known they'd be open to a new government diktat, if only the price is right. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has noodled with legislation to require an energy standard that includes nuclear energy (like that produced in his home state) along with renewables. Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar has floated what he calls a "diverse" energy standard that would mandate renewables, nuclear and . . . coal with carbon sequestration. (Indiana relies on coal.) 
This is why Mr. Obama took care in his speech to refer broadly to a "clean energy" standard and make clear he was open to including in it "nuclear" and "clean coal" -- along with renewables. He'll lure Republicans into negotiations, then cement their support with lavish energy pork for their home-state nuclear, clean-coal, wind, biofuels and solar projects. As a bonus, the plan gives cover to nervous coal state Democrats. 
What the White House also knows -- as do most sensible people -- is that these promises mean little. The president has made grand nuclear gestures, but his regulators continue to sit on projects. Clean coal remains a pipe dream. Here's to betting that if and when the president's "clean energy" standard kicks in, the only mandated sources utilities have to choose from are wind, solar and biofuels. 
The GOP has spent some long, sometimes uncomfortable, years explaining the perils of cap and trade. Yet they risk getting the same policy, all because they've yet to find the moxy to resist the "clean energy" drumbeat.

Corporate News: Exxon Sees Coal Use Being Surpassed by Gas

Abstract 
Gas usage is expected to grow three times as fast as that of oil and coal as developing countries scramble to bring electricity to billions of people and rich nations replace aging coal-fired power plants with gas-fired facilities, the report says. 

Full Text 
In Exxon Mobil Corp.'s crystal ball, the future of natural gas is looking increasingly rosy. 
Global demand for natural gas, commonly used for heating homes and businesses and for generating electricity, will increase 2% a year through 2030, the Texas oil giant says, raising the 1.8% estimate it made last year. 
This is no small change. It means that Exxon expects the world in 2030 to burn seven quadrillion British thermal units of gas more than the company predicted a year ago. That's about the same amount of energy consumed by California in a year. 
While oil will remain the dominant fuel, even in 2030, gas will have surpassed coal to become the world's second-largest source of energy, supplying 26% of world needs to oil's 32%, according to Exxon's annual Outlook for Energy, scheduled to be released Thursday. 
Gas usage is expected to grow three times as fast as that of oil and coal as developing countries scramble to bring electricity to billions of people and rich nations replace aging coal-fired power plants with gas-fired facilities, the report says. 
Clean-burning natural gas represents less of a global warming threat than coal or oil. Other low-emitting forms of energy, such as nuclear and renewable power, also are expected to expand their share of the world's energy pie. 
Exxon's Outlook for Energy is closely watched, as it underpins the strategy of the world's largest publicly-traded oil company. "It provides the foundation for the different [Exxon] businesses to present their investment plans," says Bill Colton, Exxon's vice president for corporate strategic planning. 
It's no surprise that Exxon is enthusiastic about natural gas. The company last year became the largest gas producer in the U.S. when it bought XTO Energy Inc. for $25 billion. XTO was one of several North American companies that perfected a method to extract gas economically by fracturing tight rock formations called shales. Exxon also bought small shale producer Ellora Inc. for $695 million and natural-gas shale assets from Petrohawk Energy Corp. for $575 million. 
But Exxon's optimism comes amid some Wall Street criticism of its recent bets on natural gas, which has traded cheaply since the financial crisis started, while oil has surged of late and thus has been more profitable. 
Other energy forecasts aren't as bullish about natural gas as Exxon's. The International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration put natural gas's global market share at slightly above 22% in 2030, behind oil and coal in supplying the world's needs. 
Natural-gas prices have fallen to about $4.49 a million BTUs this month from above $13 a million BTUs in mid-2008. Oil prices, on the other hand, were trading as low as $40 a barrel in early 2009 as a result of the recession, but have recovered steadily. On Wednesday, crude futures in New York settled at $87.33 a barrel, up $1.14. 
Nonetheless, Exxon, which has its roots in John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, believes the world is tilting toward a natural-gas dominated future and is preparing to embrace it. 
Some other large Western energy companies are heading that direction. Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell PLC Chief Executive Peter Voser said in an internal publication the Anglo-Dutch oil giant in 2012 would for the first time produce more natural gas than oil. 
Mary Barcella, a consultant with IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, says that new technology making shale-gas discoveries economic "is a game changer" that revolutionized the once waning U.S. natural-gas business; Exxon and others intend to take that expertise to other regions of the globe. 
Exxon's Mr. Colton says shale and other unconventional types of gas began playing a prominent role in the company's predictions about three years ago, when it realized that a major technological shift had occurred. 
Exxon forecasters say that the world will consume about 35% more energy in 2030 than in 2005, driven by population growth and the rapid enrichment of developing nations, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Colton's team analyzed statistics for 100 countries and Exxon scientists gauged potentially disruptive technologies, such as electric-car batteries. 
Natural gas will quench 26% of the world's demand, up from about 21% in 2005, the report says. That means that gas usage will double from 2000 levels, but a supply crunch is unlikely, due to the newfound abundance of the fuel, says Mr. Colton. "The world is looking at a very robust supply of natural gas," he said.

Abstract 
The U.K.'s Conservative-led coalition government has dispatched the two senior ministers to Australia -- backed by a team of high-ranking defense officials that includes Iain Lobban, director of Britain's spy agency, and Gen. David Richards, chief of the defense staff -- as defense spending in the Asian-Pacific region grows along with its surging economies. 

Full Text 
CANBERRA, Australia -- China's growing military influence across the Asian-Pacific region will top the agenda when U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defense Secretary 

Liam Fox arrive in Australia this week for bilateral talks, shortly after pictures were released of China's first stealth fighter aircraft. 
The U.K.'s Conservative-led coalition government has dispatched the two senior ministers to Australia -- backed by a team of high-ranking defense officials that includes Iain 
Lobban, director of Britain's spy agency, and Gen. David Richards, chief of the defense staff -- as defense spending in the Asian-Pacific region grows along with its surging 
economies. 

"This is the century of the Asia-Pacific," Australian Defense Minister Stephen Smith told reporters in Sydney on Monday. "Influence is moving to our part of the world, and the 

world needs to adjust to that." 
The visit is the first by a British foreign secretary since 1994. It comes as Australia's exports of coal and ore are turning the country into an emerging regional economic 
powerhouse, spurred by demand for its resources from Asia. 

"Our visit will be an opportunity to explore how Britain and Australia can work together to bring peace to troubled areas, to counter terrorism, to tackle climate change and to 

manage evolving global power structures," Mr. Hague said in a statement on Monday. 
The centerpiece of the visit will be a day of talks on international policy and security issues Tuesday, led by Mr. Smith, the Australian defense minister, and Australian Foreign 
Minister Kevin Rudd, followed by a dinner with Prime Minister Julia Gillard. 

The visit coincides with a rise in China's military power and in Beijing's involvement in regional issues, including recent tensions involving territorial disputes with Japan and 
Vietnam and China's continued unease about U.S. support of Taiwan. Tensions between North and South Korea also have complicated China's relations in the region. 
Canberra is pressing for greater military transparency in the region. Mr. Rudd used a recent visit to China to press for more openness in response to Beijing's military buildup. 

Australia's defense department estimates that China spent more than US$150 billion in 2009 on its military, more than double the official Chinese figure. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. and Europe are looking for ways to trim military spending. Defense cuts in the U.K. are expected to shave 11% from military spending by 2017 and 
threaten a number of key programs, according to military think tank the Royal United Services Institute. 

Britain is also seeking buyers for some of its old equipment, including its fleet of Harrier jump-jet fighters and aging aircraft carriers. 
Advisers say Messrs. Hague and Fox will use the visit to help market U.K. defense equipment, but the talks are unlikely to deliver firm commitments to make purchases. 
Australia is boosting defense spending as it seeks to counterbalance China's power in the region. Canberra plans to spend more than US$50 billion over the next 20 years on 

projects that include purchasing air warfare destroyers, submarines, frigates and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. 
British and Australian troops have served in combined U.S.-led operations recently in Afghanistan and Iraq, with the campaigns stirring controversy in both countries. 
Australia has thwarted numerous home-grown terrorist incidents in recent years, including plans by a Melbourne-based cell to carry out an attack on the Holsworthy Army 

Barracks in western Sydney in 2009. The government plans to triple its secret-service numbers to 1,860 by July this year, and is building a new high-security office on the 

shores of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, the nation's capital. 
Only a handful of Australian security personnel remain in Iraq, helping protect the Australian Embassy, after the center-left Labor government made good on a 2007 election 
promise to withdraw combat troops. 

In Afghanistan, Australia currently has around 1,500 troops helping train a brigade of more than 3,000 Afghan soldiers to take over responsibility for security in Uruzgan 
province. 
Units of Special Air Service soldiers and Australian commandos also have been deployed in the international effort to seek out insurgents.

Abstract 
Pressure is building for more subsidy cuts in Germany, whose position as the world's No. 1 in solar installations despite its hardly torrid climate testifies to the power of government incentives. 

Full Text 
[Financial Analysis and Commentary] 
Have you heard about China's secret plan to build itself a shield against climate change while everyone else roasts? Neither have we. 
But national rivalry always lurks around an industry as dependent on government support as renewable energy. Just before Christmas, egged on by the United Steelworkers, the 
U.S. Trade Representative said China's subsidies to its wind power firms blocked American competitors like General Electric. France suspended subsidies on some solar projects pending a review; the environment minister said 90% of its solar panels are from China. 
Protectionism is counterproductive for an industry predicated on global agreements to fix the climate. But "green jobs" owe more to domestic politics than multilateralism. 
As BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research analyst Matthew Yates puts it: "Protectionism helps inefficient companies, like European solar manufacturers, to survive by selling product at a much better price than they would otherwise be able to in open markets." Longer term, by raising costs, it would ultimately damage renewable energy's prospects. 
Mr Yates, who is bearish on European solar stocks, thinks a protectionist outbreak unlikely. But the fact that he sees it as "the best bull case" for the sector speaks volumes about the key role politics plays in supporting renewable energy valuations -- and hurting them. 
Take Spain. Its government gifted a lump of coal to the renewable energy business last week by cutting subsidies on solar plants by up to 30%. 
This will have more impact on existing than new projects: Spain has hosted 18% of new solar installations over five years but should account for just 3% of installations globally this year, Stifel Nicolaus says. 
This retroactive cut will worry investors in solar projects beyond Spain. After all, it isn't the only country struggling to balance its public finances. Pressure is building for more subsidy cuts in Germany, whose position as the world's No. 1 in solar installations despite its hardly torrid climate testifies to the power of government incentives. When that power supply falters, renewable energy stocks' prospects are plunged into darkness.

Abstract 
The agency's moves to adopt new controls on greenhouse-gas emissions have drawn opposition from smokestack industries and some members of Congress, who say new regulations will chill the economy and cost jobs. 

Full Text 
The Obama administration is planning to accelerate new greenhouse-gas regulations for power plants and oil refineries amid stiff opposition from industry and congressional Republicans. 
The administration is also escalating a clash with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has refused to sign on to its climate agenda. 
The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce Thursday that it will propose standards for controlling greenhouse-gas emissions from U.S. power plants by July 2011 and for refineries by December 2011. 
The proposed new power-plant regulations are likely to limit the amount of carbon dioxide a facility can emit for each megawatt hour of electricity produced, a person familiar with the agency's plans said. 
That could compel utilities to switch from relatively cheap coal to cleaner sources of energy, including natural gas, wind or nuclear power. Utilities that rely heavily on coal have expressed concerns such a shift could cause electricity prices to rise. 
EPA officials declined to comment late Wednesday. 
The agency's moves to adopt new controls on greenhouse-gas emissions have drawn opposition from smokestack industries and some members of Congress, who say new regulations will chill the economy and cost jobs. Proponents of tougher action on climate change say rising global temperatures threaten disruptions to agriculture and coastal flooding, among other things. 
Texas has become a flash point in the controversy over greenhouse gas regulation. The state is balking at a variety of federal mandates, from slashing emissions of factories to increasing oversight of oil and gas production. 
The EPA's effort to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions "paints a big target on the backs of Texas agriculture and energy producers," said Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Gov. Perry. 
The EPA, in a letter to state officials, said it had "no choice" but to take over certain clean-air permits in the state effective Jan. 2 because of state officials' "unwillingness" to work with the agency.

Abstract 
According to the Northbridge Group, mandating that 20% of every utility's generation portfolio come from renewables -- a proposal currently before the Senate -- would cost $225 more per household each year than achieving the same CO2 reduction by increasing the use of existing natural gas- powered generators. 

Full Text 
What if the near-term solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions actually began with the increased use of fossil fuels? 
This is a real possibility because using natural gas to generate energy results in much lower emissions of carbon dioxide than does using coal or oil. And in recent years we've unlocked vast new supplies of natural gas. Leading industry experts now believe that North America has more than 3,000 trillion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves -­enough to meet the current rate of U.S. consumption for more than 100 years. 
These reserves can powerfully contribute to our domestic energy security while making a significant, near-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
With cap-and-trade legislation clearly off the table for now, lawmakers are considering new approaches to put America on a path to a cleaner energy future. One idea gaining momentum is Sen. Lindsey Graham's (R., S.C.) proposal to require utilities to generate a targeted share of their electricity by renewables such as wind and solar power, nuclear energy and coal technologies that capture and sequester greenhouse gasses. Mr. Graham's "Clean Energy Standard" is a good starting point for enacting a comprehensive energy policy next year, but it should be expanded to include the substitution of natural gas for coal. 
There are already more than 300 natural gas-fired electricity plants in the U.S., but according to a Congressional Research Service Report (CRS) of January 2010, we are only using 40% of their 171,000 megawatts of overall capacity. By substituting this unused gas-fired capacity for an equivalent amount of coal-based generation, the CRS report noted, we could almost immediately reduce CO2 emissions in the U.S. electricity sector by more than 10%, or more than 240 million tonnes. 
Ultimately, we'll have to retrofit conventional coal plants with new technology to capture and sequester carbon if we are to achieve more substantial reductions in global CO2 emissions. But while we work to develop an economically viable technology for retrofitting carbon, gas-fired generation offers the country a cost-effective approach to begin reducing emissions. 
Mandating the use of renewables, on the other hand, is much less attractive: Despite their allure, they displace only a modest amount of CO2 at a very high price. According to the Northbridge Group, mandating that 20% of every utility's generation portfolio come from renewables -- a proposal currently before the Senate -- would cost $225 more per household each year than achieving the same CO2 reduction by increasing the use of existing natural gas- powered generators. 
A clean energy standard that includes natural gas focuses on what's realistically available in the here-and-now. It provides real opportunities to reduce carbon emissions right away while buying us time to develop and hone other electricity- generating sources that don't rely on fossil fuels. Most importantly, it would not require us to shut down the plants that rely on our most abundant fossil fuel, coal. 
No one doubts that if we are to overcome the challenge of climate change, we will have to expand the use of renewable energy. But that doesn't mean rejecting the most effective alternatives available today. Natural gas stands out among these alternatives. 
Mr. Graham's clean energy standard has given us a workable starting point. By expanding his proposal, Congress can take an important first step toward the long-term goal of a sustainable planet.

Abstract 
When it is completed in 2012, it will be the largest power plant in the world to use advanced technology to gasify coal, strip out pollutants, and then burn that cleaner gas to produce power. 

Full Text 
In "A Fine Clean Coal Mess" (Business World, Dec. 15) Holman Jenkins Jr. raises a provocative question when he suggests that our Edwardsport project is part of an "attempt to position the company to prosper in the age of climate politics," but he comes to the wrong conclusion. 
Coal powers 95% of Indiana's electricity and half of our nation's power supply. The fact is that coal is not going away -- it is critical to our nation's economic health. Our challenge is to find ways to burn coal more cleanly. 
Our Edwardsport plant accomplishes that goal, both for Indiana and our country. When it is completed in 2012, it will be the largest power plant in the world to use advanced technology to gasify coal, strip out pollutants, and then burn that cleaner gas to produce power. 
Most importantly, the plant can operate under stronger environmental regulations that are expected in the coming years, without expensive retrofits. As the nation's third largest user of coal, it is the cornerstone of our modernization strategy and will last 40 to 50 years, and will enable us to shut down older, less efficient coal units. 
Edwardsport is designed to dramatically reduce emissions that do not contribute to climate change (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury). It will use much less water and have no ash pond, since many of its byproducts can be reused in agriculture and construction. The capture of carbon dioxide, the main cause of climate change, is being studied, but is not in the scope of the project yet because that technology is still under development. 
The plant will be one of the cleanest coal plants in the world. Due to its efficiency, Edwardsport will reduce greenhouse gases by 30%, but the fundamental driver for the project is not climate-change legislation. It is to use Indiana coal with significantly less environmental impact across the board. 
The reality is Edwardsport was supported by the state's consumer advocate, approved by the commission and received $460 million in local, state and federal incentives because it reduces virtually every environmental impact from burning coal. 
At a time with a 9.8% national unemployment rate, we have put approximately 3,000 construction workers to work on site. We have also awarded more than $700 million in contracts to Indiana businesses. In addition to dramatically reducing emissions, the plant will employ 110 to 120 permanent workers and use up to 1.9 million tons of Indiana coal per year, supporting another 170 jobs. 
More than 33% of the U.S. coal fleet is over 40 years old. As the EPA implements new regulations over the next few years, we expect as much as one third of U.S. coal plants to shut down. 
Over the past 15 years, 85% of all new U.S. power plants have been fueled by natural gas, and it is likely most of the new plants built over the next decade will be gas plants. Some predict that by 2030 more than 35% of our power will be generated using natural gas, a fuel that has had extreme price volatility. This could prove to be a dangerous bet. 
Edwardsport is the first plant in the nation to scale up coal gasification technology. Regrettably the project's cost has recently increased from $2.35 billion to $2.88 billion. But we believe that the project is a valuable investment in Indiana's future. It will also demonstrate that coal can stay in our nation's fuel mix, and do so with much less harm to our environment.

Abstract 
Though it isn't reflected in the emails, let's just assume then a certain neuralgia on Duke's part about whether Indiana regulators will continue to let the plant's costs be passed along to consumers. [...] the scandal, the state had been reasonably obliging. 

Full Text 
So far, Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers hasn't lost his job over the other big email story of the week -- the one not involving WikiLeaks. And perhaps he doesn't deserve to. Perhaps neither did the lesser executives who have gone down in the scandal. But Mr. Rogers may want to reflect on the role his clean-coal enthusiasms have played in the imbroglio. 
On Sept. 24, Scott Storms, a lawyer for the Indiana utility commission, quit and went to work for Duke after receiving an ethics waiver. That decision outraged consumer advocates. On Oct. 5, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels fired the commission's head and ordered a reopening of Mr. Storm's recent decisions involving Duke. Duke later fired Mr. Storms and also its top local executive who had hired him. 
End of story? Not by a long shot. Then came a release of emails pried loose by the Indianapolis Star, which led to the resignation last week of James Turner, Duke's executive in charge of its regulated utility businesses. The emails exposed an allegedly excessive coziness between Indiana regulators and Duke executives, who joked about cars, wine and wives. In one email, Duke's Mr. Turner wondered if the state's "ethics police would have a cow" if a top regulator visited him at his weekend home. 
Then again, you might wonder how the people involved could have helped being buddy-buddy with each other. Virtually all the players working for Duke had once worked for the Indiana government, while the main player on Indiana's side, the head of its utility commission, had once been a lawyer for a local utility now owned by Duke. 
The company in the future might be smart to hire out-of-staters to run its Indiana business. The state might be smart to subject its utility regulators to legislative confirmation or direct election by voters, as other states do to ward off cronyism. Hovering over all is Duke's Edwardsport coal-gasification plant, whose high-tech white elephanthood is a direct product of Mr. Rogers's attempt to position his company to prosper in the age of climate politics. 
The plant, which is nearly $1 billion over budget, was always destined to mean higher prices for consumers compared to the low-tech coal plants it would replace. But it was sold to the locals as supplying not just electricity but a "clean coal" future for Indiana's "dirty" coal-mining industry. More to the point, the plant's economics were supposed to be rescued when Congress passed cap and trade, dramatically hiking costs for traditional coal power plants. 
Mr. Rogers here was betting on Mr. Rogers, the closest thing to a celebrity CEO in the utility business, profiled in the New York Times magazine two years ago as a "green coal baron." No executive has lobbied as noisily or consistently for a national price on carbon output. His wish seemed certain to come true after both major parties nominated climate worrywarts in the 2008 presidential contest. 
But something about a 9.8% national unemployment rate has now made politicians less keen on imposing higher utility bills. Nor did Mr. Rogers count on what we'll boldly call the public's growing sophistication about climate science. Where the public was once prepared to believe in a pending climate meltdown because "scientists" said so, now it entertains the possibility that "scientists" are human, capable of mistaking theory for fact, of confusing belief with knowledge. 
From the start, the Edwardsport plant was unpopular with certain consumer and green groups for whom clean coal is an oxymoron, but they were outvoiced by other groups that take a more realistic view of America's dependence on coal. Now the opponents are limbering up again, joined by industrial customers such as Nucor Steel, who fret about getting socked with high-priced electricity. 
Though it isn't reflected in the emails, let's just assume then a certain neuralgia on Duke's part about whether Indiana regulators will continue to let the plant's costs be passed along to consumers. Until the scandal, the state had been reasonably obliging. But 'tis the season to be charitable. The critics should also acknowledge that Duke and the rest of the industry have been in a tough position, trying to invest billions to meet future demand despite nagging uncertainty about the future of climate policy. The Edwardsport plant may be proving a wrong bet in this regard, but that does not mean that Indiana's regulatory process has been corrupted. 
Just the opposite: The plant was hugely popular with the political firmament, and continues to benefit from a gusher of federal, state and local tax subsidies worth $460 million. One could even say the regulatory process made the Edwardsport blunder possible. Without regulators around to guarantee a return on such a risky and pioneering investment, Duke likely would have sat on it hands and let rising electricity prices take care of any gap between demand and supply while waiting for the country to make up its mind about global warming.

In the next few years, Britain plans to shut down many of its dirty coal-fired power plants, replace its aging fleet of nuclear reactors and build vast offshore wind farms. 

Full Text 
The U.K. is to publish proposals in the next few days for a major overhaul of its electricity market, designed to encourage big investments in low-carbon energy. 
In the next few years, Britain plans to shut down many of its dirty coal-fired power plants, replace its aging fleet of nuclear reactors and build vast offshore wind farms. 
But power companies say they lack the financial incentives to switch from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear, and are demanding more certainty that they can recoup what are likely to be massive investments in expensive low-carbon technologies. 
Britain has one of the most liberalized energy markets in the world, with many competing suppliers and few controls on electricity prices. 
But a consensus has emerged that the market must be reformed if the U.K. is to raise the GBP 200 billion ($316 billion) of investment required over the next 10 years to replace aging infrastructure and meet the country's climate change targets. 
The issue of incentives is to be addressed in the government's consultation on electricity market reform, which begins later this month. Ministers say the proposals it will contain could lead to the most fundamental reform of Britain's electricity sector since it was privatized 30 years ago. 
Yet there are worries about the price. "Inevitably these changes will come at the cost of rising bills for consumers," says Roger Reynolds, utilities and renewables specialist at Nomura. "Managing the potential consumer backlash is a huge political challenge." 
The consultation, which will last until next spring, is expected to include a plan to create a floor under the carbon price. The current price of allowances to emit CO2 under the European Union's emissions trading program is widely seen as too low to encourage green investment. Ministers want to introduce a top-up tax on fossil-fuel power generators that kicks in when the carbon price drops below a certain level. It is expected to be part of the next U.K. budget. 
The government also favors capacity payments for low-carbon electricity generation. These would reward companies for making their generation capacity available to the grid when supply is tight -- even if much of the time plants stand idle. 
That idea is backed by Electricite de France SA, the French power company, which is spearheading the U.K.'s nuclear revival. EDF plans to build four new reactors in Britain by 2025.

Abstract 
[...] nuclear plants remain expensive to build: A new gas-fired power plant costs around $1 billion, or $1,000 a kilowatt, while a nuclear plant can cost at least five times that. Finland's nuclear safety regulator, STUK, criticized Areva's concrete supplier, saying it and other subcontractors had "no prior experience in nuclear power plant construction." 

Full Text 
OLKILUOTO, Finland -- A thickly wooded island off the west coast of Finland is the cradle of the global nuclear renaissance, but it's been a difficult birth. 
French engineering company Areva SA is building the world's first new-generation nuclear reactor here. Some 4,000 workers from across Europe toil in the shadow of its vast 
concrete containment dome. 
But the Olkiluoto-3 reactor has had a deeply troubled history. Originally slated to cost around $4 billion (3 billion euros), its price tag has nearly doubled to $7.2 billion. And it is 

four years behind schedule. 

Areva, whose main shareholder is the French government, and its Finnish customer, Teollisuuden Voima Oyj, or TVO, have had a spectacular falling out over the project. The two 
are countersuing each other for compensation over the delays, with TVO accusing Areva of gross negligence. 
The French insist the project is a success. "It's an investment in the future," says the project director, Jean-Pierre Mouroux. "It's the first of a kind, and we've learned a lot of 

lessons." 

Capable of powering 1.5 million homes, and designed to withstand a 9/11-style direct hit by a commercial airliner, Olkiluoto was to be the flagship of the global nuclear revival. 
Instead it has become a symbol of the enormous cost, complexity and risk of new nuclear projects. 
Nuclear power's reputation was badly marred by the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe and the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. But it has made a comeback as rising concern 

about energy security and global warming have increased the appeal of nonfossil fuels. Some 58 nuclear reactors are currently being built in 15 countries. 
Yet the economics of nuclear energy have deteriorated, especially in the U.S., where the shale gas boom has driven down the price of natural gas, making alternatives like 

nuclear less competitive. Meanwhile, nuclear plants remain expensive to build: A new gas-fired power plant costs around $1 billion, or $1,000 a kilowatt, while a nuclear plant 
can cost at least five times that. 
Nuclear advocates stress the low operating costs once a reactor is running. They also say the price tag won't seem so high if gas and coal-fired plants have to start paying for 

the carbon dioxide they emit. 

Yet after Olkiluoto, utilities increasingly worry about the risk of cost blowouts and long delays. "If the vendors can't tell them definitively how long it's going to take to build a 
reactor, how can they go to market and get financing?" asks Ann Mac Lachlan, European head of Platts Nuclear Publications. 
The reactor being built in Finland, the European Pressurized Reactor, or EPR, was the fruit of research efforts by Areva and Germany's Siemens AG to create a new generation of 

safe, efficient nuclear plants. 

It boasts a "core-catcher," or concrete basin designed to trap and douse the reactor core in the event of a meltdown. The reactor itself is sheathed in a steel-lined double 
concrete shell strong enough to withstand an air attack. 
In 2003, Finland became the first country to order an EPR. Soon, Areva got an order for another one, in Flamanville, France, and for two more in Taishan, China. 
But Areva and Siemens didn't have detailed design documents ready when construction on Olkiluoto started, and they underestimated the time it would take to complete them, 

setting the scene for big delays. 
Then, regulators stopped work at the site for several months after it emerged that the concrete mix used to build the base of the plant was too watery. 
Finland's nuclear safety regulator, STUK, criticized Areva's concrete supplier, saying it and other subcontractors had "no prior experience in nuclear power plant construction." It 

also said Areva appeared to have chosen companies on the basis of price rather than expertise. 
Areva blames its difficulties on the 20-year hiatus in the nuclear industry. "The supply chain was lost after the end of the 1990s, and we had to revive it," says Mr. Mouroux. 
Inspectors also uncovered welding problems: The gaps between the panels of the steel liner encasing the reactor were larger than specified in the design documents, they 

noted. The discrepancy, STUK said, was "absolutely unacceptable." 
In 2008, STUK demanded changes to Olkiluoto's automation systems, and the following year, it halted work on the pipes of the reactor's critical cooling system after it 
discovered welders had violated procedures. Areva itself had to scrap piping made for Olkiluoto at its fabrication plant in France after it discovered the components didn't comply 
with the Finns' stricter safety requirements. 

Areva blames the Finns for the delays. "Some minor adjustments to the design took weeks to be approved, when they should have been resolved on the spot," Mr. Mouroux says. 
STUK's response is contained in its 2006 report: "Finnish preciseness and attention to detail are of a level which the plant vendor did not expect," it said. 
Areva encountered problems elsewhere. The second EPR, being built in Flamanville by Electricite de France SA, the French power group, was also beset by cost overruns and 
delays. 

In 2008, South Africa called off a plan to build a new fleet of nuclear reactors after bids from Areva and Westinghouse Electric Co, a Toshiba Corp. unit, came in higher than expected. Canada made a similar about-face. 
Then, last December, Areva's EPR lost out to a cheaper, simpler South Korean model in the United Arab Emirates. 
In the U.S., Areva also suffered setbacks. Last month, Constellation Energy Group Inc. pulled out of a venture with EDF to build an EPR at Calvert Cliffs in Maryland, complaining 
that the terms of a federal-loan guarantee were too tough. 

Areva is still confident about the EPR's prospects, though. The U.K. is in the process of approving the reactor's design and could order up to four. India may order two. And 

Areva insists the two EPRs being built in Taishan are on schedule and on budget. 
Still, the pace of nuclear expansion is much slower than many had predicted just a few years ago. "The bottom has really fallen out of the nuclear renaissance," says Ms. Mac 
Lachlan.

Abstract 
[...] I frequently cite a study by the Affordable Power Alliance, which found that by 2025 the EPA regulations could lead to as much as a 20%-22% increase in the poverty rate for African-American and Hispanic families, respectively, by decreasing median incomes and leading to hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. 

Full Text 
With regard to your Nov. 22 editorial "The EPA Permitorium": The EPA's aggressive regulatory actions on the six conventional pollutants are considered so dire by the power industry that they are collectively referred to as "the train wreck." 
It has become clear to even the most ardent Obama cheerleaders in the industry that this administration's energy policy has become "ABC" (anything but coal). Power cost and system reliability aren't even in the equation.

You rightly profile EPA's aggressive overreach but you incorrectly conclude by stating that "a key task for the next Congress will be to start pushing back." If the relationship between Congress and the agencies remains one of push and push back, the unaccountable and unelected regulatory state will always win. Instead, Congress must turn the tables and revoke some of the rule-making authority it has delegated. Thankfully, the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny Act would do just that by requiring bureaucrats to submit regulations with an impact of more than $100 million to Congress for an immediate up-or-down vote and then the president's signature. This would require agencies to craft regulations that elected officials will support. Until Congress demands that agencies act accountably, they won't; and we shouldn't be surprised if bureaucrats keep expanding their power. Congress doesn't need to push back, it needs to step up.

You editorial effectively highlight the widespread reaction to the EPA's misguided agenda to "satisfy the White House's climate-change goals." I'd like to add to the discussion the impact the regulations will have on American families, particularly families suffering or at risk of suffering as the recession continues. In my work with low-income families -­particularly minority families and senior citizen households -- I've seen families struggling to pay their bills, including the ever-rising electricity bills. As the EPA effectively halts construction on electricity projects, we'll see decreased capacity of our most affordable and reliable sources of energy -- fossil fuels, as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has noted -- while seeing decreased opportunities for new electricity projects and associated jobs. 
Furthermore, as the EPA raises costs on business and industry, the cost burden will likely be passed on to the consumer in the form of increased electricity bills. In fact, I frequently cite a study by the Affordable Power Alliance, which found that by 2025 the EPA regulations could lead to as much as a 20%-22% increase in the poverty rate for African-American and Hispanic families, respectively, by decreasing median incomes and leading to hundreds of thousands of lost jobs.

CLP, one of the biggest foreign investors in the mainland's power sector, says it no longer will build coal-fired plants in China.

Full Text 
Coal is still king in China's energy sector, and will be for years. But Beijing is laying the groundwork for nuclear and renewable energy to play a much bigger role -- and no company illustrates that shift better than Hong Kong's biggest utility, CLP Holdings Ltd. 
CLP, one of the biggest foreign investors in the mainland's power sector, says it no longer will build coal-fired plants in China. It will continue to expand capacity at its existing Chinese coal plants. But the company's new construction and other investment for the future in China will focus more on nuclear and renewable energy. 
CLP's strategy -- part of a larger shift to raise the company's noncarbon-based sources of energy to as much as 40% of generating capacity by 2020, up from a current 19% -­coincides with Chinese government subsidies and policies favoring cleaner sources of power. Among them: Giving noncoal power sources priority access to the increasingly overburdened grid. 
Burning coal has made cities like Shanghai among the smoggiest in the world, and China a target of climate-change activists everywhere. But the policy shift to cleaner energy is also a response to market forces: higher coal costs, low uranium prices, and the falling expense of building nuclear plants. 
"There's a myth that nuclear is expensive," says Andrew Brandler, CLP's chief executive. "If you standardize the design of reactors and mass-produce, then you can bring the cost down pretty dramatically. And that includes setting aside provisions for decommissioning and dealing with the spent fuel." 
The transition is likely to take decades. With coal supplying two-thirds of the country's electricity, China has resisted international treaties that would impose caps on its carbon emissions. But relying too much on coal takes a toll on the country's growth as well. Indeed, despite a surge in local coal prices in recent years, Beijing has held down power rates to fight inflation. As a result, many coal-fired plants now operate at a loss. 
Adding to coal's woes, among the policies and incentives the government has enacted to encourage rapid development of nuclear and renewable energy is a requirement that state-owned grid companies buy all of the electricity generated by nuclear and renewable sources, even when it costs more than electricity from coal-fired plants. 
CLP is making its play through longtime partner China Guangdong Nuclear Power Co., one of three state-owned groups that run and develop nuclear power plants in China. The two have a wind-energy joint venture with a planned total of 1.77 gigawatts in capacity, but mostly they own and operate nuclear reactors in China's south. CLP owns 25% of China Guangdong's Daya Bay plant and expects by early next year to acquire a 17% stake -- valued at roughly US$500 million -- in a new China Guangdong plant about 140 miles west of Hong Kong. The two companies also recently joined talks about co-investing in a new nuclear plant to supply Hong Kong, where the government has discussed more than doubling nuclear's share of local electricity needs to 50% by 2020. 
A recent study by CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets predicts that nuclear will see the fastest growth in terms of China's power generation over the next few decades. Nuclear plants can operate at stable rates year-round, while noncarbon energy sources such as wind farms and solar panels depend on the weather to generate power. Coal's share of overall power generation, meanwhile, will shrink to 63% by 2020 and 51% by 2030, the study contends, down from 78% this year. 
But there's another force favoring nuclear as well: low uranium prices. The spot price for U308, a common compound of uranium, currently stands at around $60 a pound -­down from a record $138 in 2007. 
Big risks remain for China's alternative-energy sector. The government sets prices for nuclear power on a project-by-project basis, for example, which forces investors to decide whether to build a plant without knowing the price that its output will fetch. Also, with inflation running at 4.4%, Beijing is reluctant to grant price increases for generators of any kind of power. 
But CLP's Mr. Brandler, for one, is confident that his company's noncoal investments will be profitable. The Chinese have standardized the design of nuclear reactors in use in Guangdong, he says, and most of the components are made locally. For a new plant, he estimates the cost per kilowatt of nuclear capacity in China to be $1,500 to $2,000, compared with $4,000 to $6,000 in the U.S. 
"Put all that together and run the numbers," he says, "and these projects [in China] will produce power including a reasonable profit margin at a tariff a lot lower than conventional coal in Guangdong."

Abstract 
Governments will continue to be the central driver of clean-energy innovation for the foreseeable future; without public support, the technology isn't close to being cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Because policy makers have not fully come to terms with this reality, nations simultaneously spend too little and too much on clean tech: too little on research, development and demonstration of new technologies, and too much subsidizing the commercialization of older technologies that will never be cheap enough to stand on their own.

It's time for a rethink on climate change. 
For two decades, world leaders have been trying -- and failing -- to hammer out a workable deal on global warming. Now they're meeting once again, this time in Cancun, Mexico, to kick around the same issues one more time -- and, inevitably, stumble over all of the same roadblocks. 
At the heart of it, these deals all come down to mandating emissions cuts, which means paying a lot more for energy. Some greens deny it, but clean energy still costs vastly more than fossil fuels. Significantly raising energy costs slows economic growth -- something no country wants to do. 
As a result, every country has an incentive to point the finger at someone else, while trying to game the system: sheltering key industries, understating emissions and overstating reductions. 
There is a better way. Nations should focus on lowering the cost of clean energy, not raising the cost of fossil energy. The goal? Make clean energy cheap enough to become a viable option for poor as well as rich nations. Until that happens, emissions will continue to rise, and no effort to regulate carbon can succeed. 
How do we accomplish that? Stop subsidizing old technology that will never compete with fossil fuels and create incentives for innovation. Along with ramping up support for research, governments should buy cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, prove them -- and then give away the intellectual property, so others can improve on it. 
At the same time, wealthy nations shouldn't try to hammer out these kinds of agreements in the United Nations, where they get bogged down in politicking with smaller nations. Big countries should work through the G20 and the World Trade Organization -- forums that are, however imperfect, focused on economic and trade issues. 
Finally, until clean energy becomes much less costly, there are relatively cheap fixes we can make to curb emissions, such as closing the most inefficient coal plants. And we should change how we look at climate-related aid to developing nations, focusing on better roads, housing, sewage and electrical systems. 
Here's a closer look at these ideas, and how they can get us past the current deadlock. 
Our highest goal should be to make clean energy radically cheaper and truly competitive with fossil fuels through innovation. That's where governments should focus their efforts. 
Emissions cuts have overshadowed technology innovation for so long in part because of a widespread myth -- that today's clean-energy sources are either ready or almost ready to replace fossil fuels. They are not. It will take much more innovation to make them cost-competitive. 
And the impetus for that needs to come from governments. Virtually all demand for clean-energy technology is a result of states subsidizing companies to make clean tech and consumers to buy it. Governments will continue to be the central driver of clean-energy innovation for the foreseeable future; without public support, the technology isn't close to being cost-competitive with fossil fuels. 
Because policy makers have not fully come to terms with this reality, nations simultaneously spend too little and too much on clean tech: too little on research, development and demonstration of new technologies, and too much subsidizing the commercialization of older technologies that will never be cheap enough to stand on their own. If clean-tech companies can profit making uneconomic, but subsidized, technologies, why invent anything better? 
Public investments in clean tech should work more like military procurement of new defense technologies and less like federal crop supports. What we need is competitive deployment. 
Governments should solicit bids for projects or technologies within a given class -- say, a next-generation nuclear reactor or a new solar-panel technology. Once a new technology with the lowest cost is proved, it should be set as the benchmark for another round of bids -- all with an eye toward ever-newer, ever-cheaper technologies. 
The military has used this method for decades to drive down the costs and improve the performance of critical technologies. A decade of Pentagon procurement drove the price of microchips to $20 a chip by the mid-'60s from over $1,000 in the late '50s. 
At the same time, the military heavily invested in government, university and industrial research labs to deliberately create knowledge spillover -- the sharing of intellectual property -- which is crucial to rapid innovation. 
The money for this new regime could come from various sources. The obvious source is redirecting existing energy subsidies. We might also impose a small fee on oil imports, or dedicate revenue from new oil and gas leases, as has been proposed by a number of Republican lawmakers. A low carbon tax might also help -- one that might generate roughly $25 billion annually, but not so high as to slow the economy. 
National investments in innovation won't happen if they are motivated solely, or even primarily, by the desire to achieve global emissions-reduction goals. They need to serve more immediate national objectives, such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels and getting a piece of a rapidly growing global energy market. 
This will mean pulling off a balancing act. Nations will have to protect, at least partially, their domestic clean-tech industries. There is no clean-tech industry without state subsidies, and there is no incentive for states to subsidize those industries without good reason to think that those subsidies will in large part benefit domestic companies. 
Yet nations should not entirely block foreign businesses from accessing their clean-tech markets -- or else they'd become too dependent on home-grown ideas and technologies. That's a bad bet. Radical innovation requires that ideas spill over -- quickly -- between nations and companies. 
In fact, governments should make the sharing of clean-energy intellectual property an explicit part of the competitive-deployment system. The companies that win bids to deliver the next generation of solar panels and nuclear plants at the lowest cost would have to share their intellectual property with competitors -- and quickly move on to compete for the next aggressive benchmark. 
Bids in such a system would reflect the value of both intellectual property and technology and so might cost a bit more. But probably not much; the reality is that clean-tech IP is massively overvalued. There is little real value in intellectual property that allows a company to produce clean energy at several times the cost of fossil fuels. 
The only value of present-day clean-tech intellectual property is as a public good, not a private one. Governments support clean tech in the hope that subsequent iterations of present-day intellectual property will be substantially cheaper and hence scalable without the need for government subsidies. Paying to procure cutting-edge clean-energy IP along with the technology it creates is more than worth it in order to accelerate the spillover of new knowledge among clean-tech firms, even if it costs marginally more. 
In reality, strong financial incentives for commercialization of clean-energy technologies are more than sufficient to spur private-sector innovation, even without strong intellectual-property protections. Witness tech firms the world over rushing to take advantage of China's epic state investments in new clean-energy technologies -- despite China's cavalier attitude toward intellectual property. 
In short, the competitive advantage for companies would be not today's intellectual property, but rather the ability to rapidly and repeatedly create new intellectual property to win competitive contracts. Such a strategy will strengthen America's innovation system and help U.S. businesses capture intellectual property developed abroad -- all while encouraging precisely the kind of knowledge spillover between nations and businesses that is in everyone's interest. 
The U.N. is the wrong place for hammering out the details of an international agreement on clean-energy innovation. The venue is too big and too rancorous. Small countries use the U.N. as a platform to push historical grievances against big ones, and nothing gets done. 
Instead, the focus should shift to the relatively few nations that are responsible for the vast majority of emissions -- and that have the resources to do something about it. 
Look at the numbers. There are 192 members in the U.N. But two nations, the U.S. and China, produce more than 40% of the world's emissions. If you broaden that to the G­20 countries, you've accounted for 80% of total global carbon emissions -- as well as 85% of global GDP, 80% of world trade and two-thirds of world population. The best way to address climate problems is to work through existing forums for these big countries, like the G-20 meetings. 
As the recent meeting showed, the G-20 hardly guarantees agreements among nations over vital matters like currency manipulation. But it is still an easier forum than the U.N. General Assembly. And focusing on technology innovation to make clean energy cheap -- instead of on polarizing measures like emissions cuts -- will make it easier still. 
It will take years and maybe decades before clean energy becomes cheap enough to replace fossil fuels. What can countries do in the meantime? 
For starters, wealthy nations can help poorer ones address other factors that are contributing to global warming. Black carbon -- the incomplete combustion of cheap, dirty fuels in places like India -- accelerates warming and can be reduced by replacing old diesel generators and primitive wood stoves with more-efficient alternatives. 
These actions are economical, delivering more energy for less fuel, and bring an immediate public-health benefit -- fewer respiratory illnesses and deaths from breathing dirty stove smoke. Methane, too, a potent greenhouse gas, can be cheaply captured in places like dairy farms and landfills and burned for energy. 
There are other relatively easy things the U.S. and other rich nations can do. The U.S. could better enforce the non-carbon standards of the Clean Air Act, shutting down the country's oldest and most inefficient coal plants and replacing them with natural gas or clean-energy technologies produced through a competitive-deployment process. Over the next decade, such a strategy could quickly reduce mercury and asthma-causing pollutants, as well as cut carbon emissions from U.S. coal plants by as much as 10% -- all while advancing the goal of inventing ever-cheaper low-carbon energy technologies. 
Finally, we should immediately change how we distribute climate-related aid to developing nations. 
First, we should stop talking about that aid in terms of climate change. It's impossible to tell if floods, droughts and hurricanes are caused by climate change -- and that's unlikely to change for many decades. Trying to draw a distinction between disasters caused by climate change and "natural" disasters serves a political purpose, not a scientific one: justifying climate "reparations" from rich too poor countries. 
Rich nations should focus instead on helping small nations deal with problems related to natural disasters in general. Aid should be spent on better roads, water and sewage systems, and housing -- an infrastructure that can, in short, stand up to everything from earthquakes to big storms, whether caused by increased warming or not. 
The proper institutional home for those efforts should be well-established international development agencies, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the 
U.S. Agency for International Development -- not the U.N. They're not perfect, but these institutions have a better track record of underwriting global development, collectively spending upward of $150 billion annually on international development efforts. Loans and aid for infrastructure development have traditionally created new markets, and what's more likely to win the support of Western countries in tough economic times, appeals to environmental guilt or to economic self-interest? 
Beyond that, the best route to helping nations absorb natural disasters is to broaden access to energy. Wealthy societies can handle disasters a lot better than poor ones, and access to cheap energy is crucial for building wealth. 
Fossil fuels alone won't cut it. They're still too expensive for about a third of the world's population, and will get pricier still as demand rises. If there is to be universal access to energy, there must be a global commitment to developing alternatives. 
So we come back to the beginning. Energy that is cheap, clean and available to all should be understood as a fundamental public good and should be the central objective of climate policy. It's the best way to align national interests with the global one, economic benefits with environmental ones and emissions reductions with adaptation. 
It's also the best approach for America. The U.S. has taken a pounding over the past decade as a global laggard on climate. Much of this was unfair -- Europe manipulated the Kyoto treaty's accounting to start in 1990 and 1997 so it could count emissions reductions from the collapse of Communism. But it is also the case that the U.S. has not offered a suitable alternative to the U.N. framework. 
The new climate framework we're proposing plays to America's strengths. It offers the country the chance to move from being the global scapegoat to the global leader. We are an electric nation born of invention -- one that has long used technology to overcome tough challenges. With that as our mandate, we can do a lot to help the world solve this one.

Abstract 
Mr. Gates dislikes my comments on climate change, which I think will be less damaging than official forecasts predict, while the policies designed to combat climate change will be more damaging than their supporters recognize. The number of carbon atoms we burn per unit of energy we generate is falling as we gradually switch from carbon-rich fuels like wood and coal to hydrogen-rich fuels like oil and especially gas.

[Where Does Progress Come From?] 
Bill Gates likes my book "The Rational Optimist." Really, he does. Even though he dislikes my points about Africa and climate change, these take up, as he notes, just one chapter. The rest he summarizes fairly and intelligently, and I appreciate that. It's great for an author when anybody reviews a book "well" in both senses of the word. 
It is worth explaining why I chose Africa and climate change as the "two great pessimisms of today." The answer is simple: Whenever I speak about optimism and someone in the audience protests, "But surely you cannot think that we can ever solve . . ." the subjects that most frequently cross their lips next are African poverty and global warming. Mr. Gates also mentions potential threats from super-intelligent computers and pandemics. Maybe he is right to worry about them, but I have yet to be persuaded that either is more than a small risk. 
Mr. Gates dislikes my comments on climate change, which I think will be less damaging than official forecasts predict, while the policies designed to combat climate change will be more damaging than their supporters recognize. I argue that if we rush into low-carbon technologies too soon, because we think the problem is more urgent than it is, we risk doing real harm to ecosystems as well as human living standards -- as the biofuel fiasco all too graphically illustrates. The rush to turn American corn into ethanol instead of food has contributed to spikes in world food prices and real hunger, while the rush to grow biodiesel for Europe has encouraged the destruction of orangutan habitat in Borneo. 
I also argue, however, that it is highly unlikely, given the rate at which human technology changes, that we will fail to solve the problem of man-made climate change even if it does prove more severe than I expect. For example, the world is on a surprisingly steady trajectory toward decarbonization. The number of carbon atoms we burn per unit of energy we generate is falling as we gradually switch from carbon-rich fuels like wood and coal to hydrogen-rich fuels like oil and especially gas. At current rates, we would be burning almost no carbon by about 2070, though I suspect that point will never actually be reached. 
The question that I pose in the book is whether optimism is likely to be right. In essence, neither Mr. Gates nor I think that the problem of man-made climate change is going to prove insoluble or fatal to civilization. We disagree only on how urgent it is to devote massive expenditures to dealing with it, which would put poverty reduction at risk. I think that direct spending to alleviate malaria, which now kills a million people a year and whose incidence is likely to increase as a result of global warming by less than 0.03% per year, is a far higher priority. So does Mr. Gates, judging by his foundation's spending. 
It is on Africa that Mr. Gates throws his sharpest barbs. Yet, once again, I think that we agree on the most important point, namely, that Africa can have a good future. "Development in Africa is difficult to achieve," he writes, "but I am optimistic that it will accelerate." 
Yes! I don't believe that "everything will be just fine in Africa," but I do think that Africa's real and profound problems can be overcome. My targets are the ubiquitous pessimists who say that, whatever we do, Africa is doomed to remain stuck "in deepest, darkest poverty," in the words of one environmentalist. 
Yet, with exceptions such as Somalia and the Congo, economic growth is gaining momentum all over the continent, birth rates are dropping and poverty is falling, as the Spanish economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin has documented. Lots of people deserve credit for this, among them Bill Gates. His foundation, as far as I can tell, does exactly what I suggest in the book by concentrating on solving real medical and humanitarian problems. 
Far from saying that aid "doesn't work, hasn't worked and won't work," I actually say this in my book: "Some of the most urgent needs of Africa can surely be met by increased aid from the rich world. Aid can save lives, reduce hunger, deliver a medicine, a mosquito net, a meal or a metalled road." 
I go on to say that "statistics, anecdotes and case histories all demonstrate that the one thing aid cannot reliably do is to start or accelerate economic growth." Now here I admit that Mr. Gates does have a point. Unintentionally, I have given him and perhaps other readers the impression that, in my view, combating malaria or AIDS does not pay economic dividends. It does. 
What I do take issue with is economic aid designed to stimulate economic growth. For example, a 2006 study by Simeon Djankov of the World Bank (now deputy prime minister of Bulgaria) and his colleagues concluded that "foreign aid has a negative impact on the democratic stance of developing countries and on economic growth by reducing investment and increasing government consumption." Economic aid diverts resources into projects that fail, puts money into the pockets of corrupt government officials and crowds out the efforts of entrepreneurs. In one example, only 13% of educational aid to Uganda reached schools; the rest was siphoned off by rent-seeking officials. 
I am disappointed that Mr. Gates is so defensive about "top-down" aid. Just as everything from software design to education can benefit from bottom-up crowd sourcing in which elites no longer determine what happens, so surely humanitarian aid can benefit too, however much vested interests in governments and in big agencies dislike this trend. 
Likewise, Mr. Gates takes issue with my assertion that the economy of the future will be post-corporatist and post-capitalist. I know that these radical ideas are not to everybody's taste, and he is right that most innovation takes place within existing companies. But it is very striking that some of the most far-reaching innovations over the past several decades have come from driven, visionary outsiders like Mr. Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin rather than from corporate research and development departments. What is more, these innovations have been achieved with much less capital investment up front than in the days of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford. 
It is true that there is still a vast amount of work needed to bring ideas to market, and this requires cash and corporate organization. But increasingly, corporations are turning themselves into virtual entities, arranged around flexible networks of suppliers, retailers and researchers, rather than monolithic bodies sitting in fixed plants. That seems to me to make the word "capitalist" somewhat misleading. 
Mr. Gates thinks I underplay the role of education, government, patents and science in the innovation that drives economic improvement. Maybe, but I make a carefully argued case that most of the existing commentary overplays the role of these institutions and that innovation is sometimes hindered by these institutions, too, especially by patents and government monopolies. 
Am I saying that we should cease worrying about trends that might cause problems? Of course not. I am arguing that we should worry about real problems, including Africa's plight, but that we should do so in the knowledge that we have solved many such problems before and can do so again. I am certainly not saying, "Don't worry, be happy." Rather, I'm saying, "Don't despair, be ambitious" -- though I admit it's not nearly as snappy a song lyric.

Abstract 
At a two-week United Nations climate conference in the Mexican resort city of Cancun, negotiators will focus not on the stick of mandatory emissions limits but on the carrot of tens of billions of dollars in subsidies from industrialized countries to help developing nations grow on a greener path. 

Full Text 
With the push to cap greenhouse-gas emissions all but dead in the U.S., world diplomats will meet in Mexico starting Monday to try to eke out a less-ambitious attack on global warming. 
Few observers are confident of a breakthrough. 
At a two-week United Nations climate conference in the Mexican resort city of Cancun, negotiators will focus not on the stick of mandatory emissions limits but on the carrot of tens of billions of dollars in subsidies from industrialized countries to help developing nations grow on a greener path. 
Almost all growth in global greenhouse-gas emissions in coming years is expected to come from developing countries. The subsidies likely would, among other moves, help China build more-efficient coal-fired power plants, Brazil preserve forests, and an array of developing countries build wind farms and solar projects. 
Diplomats pledged the incentives at a U.N.-sponsored climate summit in December in Copenhagen. They promised $30 billion in climate funding for poor countries by 2012, and another $100 billion annually, expected to come largely from private investment, starting in 2020. 
But negotiators left for another day the task of hashing out the details of how to deliver on those funding pledges. The day has come, but the details have prompted yet another standoff. 
Many developing countries say the U.S. and other rich nations are in some cases cutting as much money in other parts of their foreign-aid budgets as they're adding in what they call climate aid -- basically shuffling rather than enlarging their foreign-aid budgets. They say the billions of dollars in new climate aid should be in addition to that already-existing assistance. 
The U.S. rejects the argument that only climate funding that adds to past years' total amounts of foreign assistance should qualify toward such pledges, Todd Stern, the Obama administration's top climate negotiator, said in an interview. "There are very sharply differing views on what is new," he said. 
No one suggests the incentives would bankroll emission cuts large enough to put a major dent in global greenhouse-gas output. 
But the fight over these subsidies is a "concern, because, quite frankly, everyone has to start doing things now" to make deeper emission cuts down the road more possible, Robert Orr, the U.N.'s assistant secretary-general for policy planning, said in an interview. 
Yet expectations of any major emission cuts over the next decade or two are dimming. In recent months, Congressional leaders in the U.S. have made clear they don't intend to take up the issue of a nationwide emissions cap anytime soon. China has said repeatedly it doesn't intend to accept a mandatory cap. 
The U.S., China, and many other countries pledged voluntarily in Copenhagen to curb the growth in their emissions by specific amounts. The fitful economic recovery makes it easier to notch progress on those pledges, because a slower economy requires less growth in fossil-fuel consumption. Fossil fuels contribute to climate change, many national scientific academies say. And many countries are implementing policies that nurture domestic makers of renewable-energy and energy-efficiency equipment, hoping to promote new export industries. 
But the International Energy Agency said in a report this month that even if countries met the emission-reduction pledges they made in Copenhagen, greenhouse-gas output probably would rise enough to push average global temperatures more than two degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

President Obama is now retrenching after his midterm rebuke, and one of the main ways he'll try to press his agenda is through the alphabet soup of the federal regulators. So a special oversight priority for the new Congress ought to be the Environmental Protection Agency, which has turned a regulatory firehose on U.S. business and the power industry in particular. 
The scale of the EPA's current assault is unprecedented, yet it has received almost no public scrutiny. Since Mr. Obama took office, the agency has proposed or finalized 29 major regulations and 172 major policy rules. This surge already outpaces the Clinton Administration's entire first term -- when the EPA had just been handed broad new powers under the 1990 revamp of air pollution laws. 
Another measure of the EPA's aggressiveness are the six major traditional pollutants that the agency polices, such as ozone or sulfur dioxide. No Administration has ever updated more than two of these rules in a single term, and each individual rule has tended to run through a 15-year cycle on average since the Clean Air Act passed in 1970. Under administrator Lisa Jackson, the EPA is stiffening the regulations for all six at the same time. 
The hyperactive Ms. Jackson is also stretching legal limits to satisfy the White House's climate-change goals, now that Senate Democrats have killed cap and trade. The EPA's "endangerment finding" on carbon is most controversial, but other parts of her regulatory ambush may be more destructive by forcing mass retirements of the coal plants that provide half of America's electricity. 
A case study in the Jackson method is the EPA's recent tightening of air-quality standards for sulfur dioxide. The draft SO2 rule was released for the formal period of public comment last December. Yet the final rule published in June suddenly included a "preamble" that rewrote 40-odd years of settled EPA policy. 
The EPA has heretofore measured the concentration of pollutants in the ambient air by, well, measuring the concentration of pollutants in the ambient air. The preamble throws out this sampling and ultraviolet testing and substitutes computer estimations of what air quality might be. The EPA favors modelling because it can plug in the data and assumptions of its choosing, like how often a power plant is running at maximum capacity. Gaming the models will allow the agency to punish states and target individual plants, even if actual measurements show that SO2 is under the new EPA standard. 
The EPA is within its legal discretion to reinterpret clean-air laws -- but not without any prior warning, and the preamble surprise violates years of case law about federal rule-making. Worse, the agency hasn't gotten around to detailing how the models should be built or how the analysis must be conducted. Without any ground rules for approval, the permits required for any major energy or construction projects can't be issued. 
The uncertainty created by the SO2 rule and similar rule-makings has resulted in a near-total freeze on EPA permits, imposing a de facto project moratorium that will last for the next 18 months at minimum. North Dakota, Texas, Louisiana, South Dakota and Nevada are already suing the EPA because of the restrictions they now face on their "ability to permit new sources or expand existing sources," and many more states are expected to join them. 
The same goes for the EPA plan to require "maximum achievable control technology" on a plant-by-plant basis to nearly every coal- or oil-fired utility in the country to limit pollutants like mercury. The EPA started writing that rule while the data that will supposedly inform its decision were still being collected. Then there's the upcoming "boiler rule," which the EPA's lowball estimate says will impose $9.5 billion in new capital costs on manufacturers, paper mills, hospitals and the like. There are so many others. 
The electric industry in particular is being forced to choose between continuing to operate and facing major capital expenditures to meet the increasingly strict burden, or else shutting down and building replacements that use more expensive sources like natural gas. Either way, the costs will be passed through to business and consumers as higher rates, which is the same as a tax increase. The general consensus is that as much as a third of the U.S. coal-fired fleet will be retired by 2016, costing north of $100 billion -- a consensus that includes an important federal advisory agency, as we wrote last month in "The Unseen Carbon Agenda." 
Ms. Jackson responded to that editorial in a letter that waved off any criticism of her industrial policy as merely opposition to "common-sense efforts to reduce harmful pollution." And it's true that some of these costs might be justified if they resulted in real environmental improvements like less acid rain. 
Yet return to sulfur dioxide: SO2 emissions fell by 56% between 1980 and 2008, despite a 70% increase in fossil fuel-based electric generation over the same period. With current levels so low, the EPA's own 168-page analysis estimates that the direct benefits of the new SO2 regulations will amount to all of $12 million nationwide in 2020. Liquidating the EPA budget would yield better returns. 
At least 56 Senators in next year's Congress are on record supporting bills that would freeze the EPA's carbon regulation for a time or strip the agency of its self-delegated powers. But the EPA is still pursuing the same agenda through other means, harming business expansion, job creation and economic growth. A key task for the next Congress will be to start pushing back.

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT CO-CHAIRS: 
Tom Albanese 
CEO, Rio Tinto 
Lewis Hay III 
CEO, Next Era Energy Inc. 
Alan Mulally 
CEO, Ford Motor Co. 
SUBJECT EXPERT: 
Daniel Yergin 
Chairman, IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates Inc. 
The U.S. needs to diversify its energy supply. That's a given. But it also must work to restore its leadership in developing and exporting energy technology, not just to curb 

waste at home but to create markets abroad. 

Those were just a few of the themes that emerged from the task-force discussion on energy and the environment, moderated by The Wall Street Journal's Jeffrey Ball. Here are 
edited excerpts of their presentation of priorities to the CEO Council: 
JEFFREY BALL: There was, running through all of these priorities, a call for certainty in what government is going to do or not going to do. 
Tom Albanese, why don't you start on the first one -- domestic energy. 
TOM ALBANESE: Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg said it best today when he said we need to wean ourselves off foreign oil; we need to stop sending money to the terrorists who are 

trying to kill us. 
So we talked about nuclear power: How can that be ramped up? There was a good discussion about avoiding that short-term offshore-drilling moratorium from becoming a 
long-term de facto moratorium through complex and confusing regulation. We talked a bit about coal and the importance of coal in terms of the U.S. power system, and how 
carbon capture and sequestration needs to be a part of that picture. Good discussion on natural gas, particularly shale gas -- the availability of shale gas, the technology for 

that, and possibly also the ability to export that technology overseas. There was some discussion about ethanol and some of the incentives that are around ethanol. And finally, 
renewables were discussed, particularly solar, and why solar should be a bigger part of it. 
Despite the fact that some of these energy sources are cheaper than others, there was a wholesale agreement on the need for some type of diversification of that supply base 

and that markets should be the ones picking the winners. Government shouldn't be trying to pick the winner. 

Carbon was brought up on and off. There was sort of a lack of fortitude about when carbon will come through the regulatory process, but there was a recognition that some type 
of carbon pricing will be needed, if only to get things like the technology of carbon capture and sequestration off the ground. 
Of course shale gas is going to be a very topical subject. I think we all recognize it potentially becoming that energy godsend. But it was also recognized that utilities may 

potentially over-rely on that at the expense of diversifying the rest of their supply base. 
MR. BALL: Alan, what about research and development? 
ALAN MULALLY: We really focused on the fundamental enabling technology that would have the most synergy for economic development, energy independence and security, and 

also environmental sustainability. 

One example that we moved way up on our priority list were batteries. We're talking a lot about an electric future and the infrastructure to go with that in addition to the vehicles, and how important it is that we have batteries that would work in a system solution, meaning we would be able to generate the electricity clean. We'd be able to store it. We'd be able to move electricity from our homes to our vehicles to the grid, and what that enabling technology that's needed to make that happen. 
We also really agreed on the value of a long-term public-private partnership. 
MR. BALL: Consistency of federal regulation was something that was pretty uniformly endorsed. Lew, do you want to get into that? 
LEWIS HAY: Climate change is an issue that's not going away. We all recognize that cap and trade is dead for the moment, may be dead forever, but we're going to need some 

kind of a signal on carbon. Sometimes we talk about a price on carbon; other times we talk about incentives for clean. We need consistency. 
One of the themes we've heard at this conference has been the impact of uncertainty on business, and in particular the uncertainty on businesses being willing to invest. 
And in the energy field, this is a huge issue. I think there's hundreds of billions of dollars that companies are ready to invest if this uncertainty could get cleared up. 
There was a lot of talk about how a patchwork of state regulations makes for a much less efficient business environment, makes it much tougher for businesses to do business. 

So we're looking for federal leadership here. There is kind of a crying out for clarity and consistency in federal regulation. 

MR. BALL: It was very interesting that there was a dilemma that shale gas presents, which is that there was a sense that it makes other alternatives much more difficult to make viable, or somewhat more difficult to make viable. That is, nuclear and renewables have a relatively harder row to hoe when gas is $4 than when gas was $8 or $12. MR. HAY: We all agreed that we still need a diverse energy supply, and that's been one of the strengths of the U.S. So there is a concern about this dash to gas and the need, 
one way or another, through the market mechanisms or other incentives or a price on carbon, to allow for a diverse energy supply. 
MR. BALL: The fourth priority had to do with looking outward rather than inward. Tom, do you want to talk about that? 
MR. ALBANESE: There's a need not just to connect R&D for innovation for American technologies and American applications, but also to push technologies overseas, to create a 

new type of export-driven job. 
I see the Germans pitching all sorts of clean technologies very aggressively all over the world. China celebrates its engineers. They're taking the lead in solar power. They're 

putting money into it; they're putting money into the next generation of batteries. The Japanese, the Koreans are going gangbusters. But you don't see, to the extent you really need to see, American products being aggressively pushed around green power, alternative energies. And what are the reasons for that? Part of it has to do with competitiveness. Part of it is going to be branding. As long as America is seen to be late coming to the party on 
carbon, it's probably going to be seen late coming to the party on carbon-based innovation. 
MR. BALL: And, lastly, energy efficiency. Tom? 
MR. ALBANESE: We're all familiar with the need for increased energy efficiency and how the U.S. really is, on a per-capita basis, one of the biggest users of energy. 
We saw energy efficiency as something that could help our economy lower costs for customers but also, through leadership in energy efficiency, create opportunities to sell 

technology and products overseas. So it wasn't just an inward looking perspective. 
There was some discussion about building efficiency. One person pointed out that there's something like 40 to 50% potential for energy savings just in buildings. 
MR. BALL: There was a palpable sense of frustration in the room on this point of the competitiveness of this country in the global energy picture, a sense that if things don't 

change, this country and its companies are going to lose out in the ability to compete in a way that's going to be very difficult to recover from. 

The Top Five Recommendations 
1.
 DEVELOP DOMESTIC ENERGY 

Promote development of all domestic resources with appropriate environmental safeguards and a regulatory system that is timely and predictable and avoids a back-door, de facto moratorium. Don't pick winners. 

2.
 SUPPORT R&D 

Ensure long-term commitment by the federal government to basic research and development for new energy sources and carbon mitigation, and provide stable incentives for R&D in the private sector and universities. Energy storage is crucial, yet technological breakthroughs are necessary before deploying batteries and fuel cells at scale. Focus on R&D to bring down costs rather than mandates and subsidies for immediate deployment. 

3.
 CONSISTENT FEDERAL REGULATION 

A comprehensive energy policy that provides consistency and predictability for investment. Clearer policy on auto fuel efficiency, siting of electrical transmission, and carbon constraints -- avoiding a patchwork of state rules. Consider the country's massive natural-gas resources and create a path for nuclear and renewables. Be honest about the continued primacy of fossil fuels and costs. Pause and think before issuing new regulations. 

4.
 COMPETITIVENESS 

Restore U.S. companies' leadership in developing and exporting energy technology around the world. Remove tax policies and other burdens that impede U.S. firms' global competitiveness. 

5.
 ENERGY EFFICIENCY 


Put the U.S. at the forefront of energy-efficiency technology, both to curb waste at home and to create markets abroad. Policies should include building codes, appliance standards and incentives to deploy new energy-efficient technologies. Credit: By Jeffrey Ball

California's Destructive Green Jobs Lobby

Abstract 
The irony is that a century-long trend of advance in conventional "non-renewable" energy -- from wood to oil to natural gas and nuclear -- has already wrought a roughly 60% drop in carbon emissions per watt. [...] the long-term California targets might well be achieved globally in the normal course of technological advance. 

Full Text 
California officials acknowledged last Thursday that the state faces $20 billion deficits every year from now to 2016. At the same time, California's state Treasurer entered bond markets to sell some $14 billion in "revenue anticipation notes" over the next two weeks. Worst of all, economic sanity lost out in what may have been the most important election on Nov. 2 -- and, no, I'm not talking about the gubernatorial or senate races. 
This was the California referendum to repeal Assembly Bill 32, the so-called Global Warming Solutions Act, which ratchets the state's economy back to 1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2020. That's a 30% drop followed by a mandated 80% overall drop by 2050. Together with a $500 billion public-pension overhang, the new energy cap dooms the state to bankruptcy. 
Conservative pundits have lavished mock pity on the state. But as America's chief fount of technology, California cannot go down the drain without dragging the rest of the country with it. 
The irony is that a century-long trend of advance in conventional "non-renewable" energy -- from wood to oil to natural gas and nuclear -- has already wrought a roughly 60% drop in carbon emissions per watt. Thus the long-term California targets might well be achieved globally in the normal course of technological advance. The obvious next step is aggressive exploitation of the trillions of cubic feet of low-carbon natural gas discovered over the last two years, essentially ending the U.S. energy crisis. 
The massive vote against repeal of the California law -- 62% to 38% -- supports an economy-crushing drive to suppress CO2 emissions from natural gas and everything else. In a parody of supply-side economics, advocates of AB 32 envisage the substitution of alternative energy sources that create new revenue sources, new jobs and industries. Their economic model sees new wealth emerge from jobs dismantling the existing energy economy and replacing it with a medieval system of windmills and solar collectors. By this logic we could all get rich by razing the existing housing plant and replacing it with new-fangled tents. 
All the so-called "renewables" programs waste and desecrate the precious resource of arable land that feeds the world. Every dollar of new wages for green workers will result in several dollars of reduced pay and employment for the state's and the nation's other workers -- and reduced revenues for the government. 
Most destructive of all is the bill's stultifying effect on America's and California's most important asset: the venture capital industry, which accounts for the nation's technological leadership, military power, and roughly a fifth of GDP. 
Led by Al Gore's investment affiliate, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, the campaign to save AB 32 raised $31 million -- more than three times the $10 million that the oil companies raised for repeal. Pouring in millions were such promethean venturers as John Doerr and Vinod Khosla of Kleiner Perkins, Eric Schmidt and Sergei Brin of Google, and the legendary Gordon Moore and Andrew Grove of Intel. The campaign even managed to shake down a contribution from the state's public utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, and gained the backing of the GOP's eBay billionaire gubernatorial candidate, Meg Whitman. 
What is wrong with California's plutocratic geniuses? They are simply out of their depth in a field they do not understand. Solar panels are not digital. They may be made of silicon but they benefit from no magic of miniaturization like the Moore's Law multiplication of transistors on microchips. There is no reasonable way to change the wavelengths of sunlight to fit in drastically smaller photo receptors. Biofuels are even less promising. Even if all Americans stopped eating (saving about 100 thermal watts per capita on average) and devoted all of our current farmland to biofuels, the output could not fill much more than 2% of our energy needs. 
In the past, Kleiner Perkins funded scores of vital ventures, from Apple and Applied Materials to Amazon and Google. But now Kleiner is moving on to such government-dependent firms as Miasole, Amyris Biofuels, Segway and Upwind Solutions. Many have ingenious technology and employ thousands of brilliant engineers, but they are mostly wasted on pork catchers. 
Other venturers plunged into solar panel manufacturer Solyndra, which received some $500 million in federal subsidies and a campaign visit from Barack Obama before laying off 17% of its work force and giving up on a new factory that was supposed to create 1,000 green jobs. 
Many of these green companies, behaving like the public-service unions they resemble, diverted some of their government subsidies into the AB 32 campaign for more subsidies. Virtually every new venture investment proposal harbors a "green" angle that turns it from a potential economic asset into a government dependent. 
A partial solution is a suit by four attorneys general outside of California. They argue that the California law violates the Constitution's interstate commerce clause because of the limits it places on electricity generated by out-of-state, coal-fired power plants. But ultimately the new Congress must act. The Center for American Progress has found that 50 out of 100 or so new Republican congressmen elected earlier this month are "climate-change skeptics." But Republican leaders such as incoming Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor show dangerous gullibility in the face of environmentalist claims. 
Co-sponsoring a disgraceful bill introduced in September to force utilities to expand their use of "renewable energy" to 15% by 2021 are Republican Sens. Sam Brownback and Susan Collins. Republican politicians are apparently lower in climate skepticism than readers of Scientific American, which recently discovered to its horror that some 80% of its subscribers, mostly American scientists, reject man-made global warming catastrophe fears. 
Republicans may delude themselves that the U.S. can undertake a costly, inefficient and disruptive transformation of the energy economy, estimated by the International Energy Agency to cost some $45 trillion over 40 years, while meeting our global military challenges and huge debt overhang. But the green campaign wastes scarce and precious technological and entrepreneurial resources indispensable to the nation's future. Now it is debauching America's most precious venture assets. It must be defeated, not appeased.

Abstract 
Where they can build a credible growth strategy and a position in the climate change debate is by promoting natural gas, which emits 71% and 56% the amount of carbon dioxide as oil and coal, respectively. 

Full text 
[Financial Analysis and Commentary] 
Chevron Corp.'s recently launched "We Agree" advertising campaign resembles at first the usual caring, sharing fluff that reached its apotheosis a decade ago with BP's "Beyond Petroleum." 
But Chevron's tack is actually different and points to how the oil majors can recover their poise -- and their attraction to investors. 
"Beyond Petroleum" created unrealistic expectations about the demise of fossil fuels. In 2007, 10% of world energy came from renewables, mostly hydropower, according to the Energy Department. By 2035, they are forecast to represent all of 14%. Oil and natural gas are expected to still account for 52%; coal, 28%. 
Chevron's adverts spell out that, when it comes to oil and gas "no other form of energy is as economical, as plentiful or as reliable." 
Without fossil fuels, the Western world wouldn't have the standard of living it now fears losing, and developing economies would have no hope of equaling it. 
Despite their central role in facilitating this, the majors are reviled both in the court of public opinion and among investors. Their price/earnings multiples have dropped 44% on average to under 10 times over the past 10 years. 
Self-inflicted wounds range from Royal Dutch Shell's reserves scandal through BP's multiple safety lapses to a collective step back from the central function of finding oil and gas. The majors spent the equivalent of 1.3% of their market capitalization on exploration last year, compared with 4.9% for large U.S. exploration and production companies, says Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, big recent finds in areas like offshore Brazil have gone to smaller competitors, who have been rewarded with soaring stock prices. 
Priority No. 1, therefore, is refocusing on the core exploration business. Just days after Chevron's campaign launched, it announced development would start on a new project in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, scene of BP's disaster. BP itself used its third-quarter results announcement to signal renewed focus on exploration. 
Diehard supporters of alternative fuels might prefer to see deep water entirely off-limits. But this would actually be counterproductive to their cause by raising oil prices. Solar and wind power compete more with coal than with oil, which is overwhelmingly a transportation fuel. As in the recent recession, higher oil prices helped slow the economy, hurting electricity demand and sapping utilities' will to invest in all types of generation capacity. 
But while oil remains a core business, resource nationalism and political opposition make it essentially an ex-growth business for the majors. 
Where they can build a credible growth strategy and a position in the climate change debate is by promoting natural gas, which emits 71% and 56% the amount of carbon dioxide as oil and coal, respectively. In addition, 51% of gas reserves lie outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, compared with just 23% for oil. And unlike oil, where industrialized world demand is squeezed by prices and environmental legislation, gas can tap growth everywhere, be it from economic development in Asia, or displacing coal-fired electricity in the West. 
Building positions in gas isn't popular right now, as Exxon Mobil's stock-market drubbing since buying XTO Energy last year demonstrates. New supply and recession have combined to depress gas prices and turn investors off. In itself, however, that should spur demand. The majors must tap into that if they are to reassert their relevance and restore investors' interest.

Abstract 
[...] the one significant attempt to block the Gulf was undertaken by the U.S. itself, to shut Iraq and Kuwait out of global markets after Saddam's 1990 invasion -- which ought to tell you something. 

Full Text 
GM must be thrilled, if not a little disoriented, by its latest leap to Apple-like cultural relevance, given the passionate fanboy debate over its latest disclosures about the Chevy 
Volt. 
The car, strictly speaking, isn't at every moment driven by electric power. At highway speeds, the gasoline engine that generates electricity when the batteries are depleted will, 
under certain circumstances, directly turn the planetary ring gear and help drive the car. 

I know. When I heard this, I ran about the house shrieking "Well, then, the Volt is not an 'extended-range' EV but a series-parallel hybrid!" I'm sure you did too. 
Some of the more ardent students of such esoterica now accuse GM of having "lied" about the Volt's fundamental nature, but GM must be astonished that so many want to take 

up the argument at all. As a bonus, debating the Volt's electric bona fides changes the subject from the mileage tests starting to come in from independent reviewers, such as 
Popular Mechanics. 
GM claimed for months that the car would get 50 miles per gallon (mpg) when in gas mode, though this was scarcely believable. Popular Mechanics finds that, running on gas, 

the car gets 38 mpg on the highway (burning premium fuel no less), or slightly worse mileage than its conventional sister, the Chevy Cruze. And this performance, GM now tells us, is 10% to 15% better than it would be if the gas engine weren't sometimes directly driving the wheels. 
Discerning critics still applaud the originality and cleverness of GM's engineering, and we will too. But the question lingers: Why bother with all this complicated doohickery? 
Cars account for 9% of America's CO2 output, making power plants a much more sensible target if your worry is global warming. Ironically, the Volt rolls out amid news that an 
investor is abandoning a big U.S. nuclear project, leaving America more dependent than ever on "dirty" coal for its electricity. 

Storing electricity -- which is what the Volt's batteries do -- is probably the least efficient thing you can do with the output of such plants. Then again, perhaps this explains the 

rapturous greeting the Volt is receiving from the utility industry. 
In GM's backyard, Detroit Edison will be chipping in $2,500 each to cover the cost of installing home charging stations for the first 2,500 electric car buyers -- in a territory 
where most of the power is supplied by nine coal-fired power plants. 

In central Michigan, Consumers Energy will install a like number of charging stations for its customers -- who get a majority of their power from four large coal plants. 

The city of Lansing, as owner of the Lansing Board of Water and Light, will install 25 charging stations for the city's 450,000 residents -- most of whose power comes from three 
large coal plants, including one built in the 1920s. 
The Volt's defenders will shout that the Volt is a blow against terrorism and in favor of energy independence. Two answers: The Volt doesn't need defenders if it's a car that 

consumers want, and that GM can make and sell at a profit. But GM can't. And it's doubtful that many of the Volt's early adopters (aside from a Hollywood plutocrat or two) 

would be interested in the absence of a giant tax credit of $7,500 per car (paid for by you and me). 
The second answer is that even if every American drove a Volt, and every car in America was a Volt, it would not appreciably change the global challenges we face. Oil would 
remain an immensely versatile commodity, and Middle Eastern countries (which have the lowest production costs) would continue to reap large revenues. 

Likewise, the idea that our military budget is mainly spent to keep oil flowing from the Persian Gulf is an illusion. In fact, the one significant attempt to block the Gulf was 

undertaken by the U.S. itself, to shut Iraq and Kuwait out of global markets after Saddam's 1990 invasion -- which ought to tell you something. 
Freedom of the seas is a vital principle, but the practical use of U.S. military power is to deny others that freedom when it suits our interests. To imagine this would change as a 
result of some change in how we fuel our cars at home is to understand nothing about military power and why we invest to get and maintain it. 

The hunt for a rationale for the Volt subsidies -- not just buyer handouts, but government loans for assembly and battery plants -- is destined always to come up empty. The 
ethanol scam is your model here -- a gravy train that will have to continue in perpetuity because mass-market electric cars can't survive on their own merits.

Abstract 
[...] Mr. Obama may be the least of his party's problems right now. 

Full Text 
Democrats are riding the back of President Barack Obama in a last-lap attempt to contain damage in the midterm elections, and for good reason: Bruised though he may be, the president remains the best asset Democrats have. 
In fact, Mr. Obama may be the least of his party's problems right now. He remains decidedly more popular than his party's congressional leaders, individually or collectively. 
Beyond that, many of the Democratic Party's current political woes can be traced to the tactics and decisions of its congressional wing. 
Which isn't to say that the president can or will represent a savior for his party in this season of discontent. The man who turned "hope" into a rationale for an entire presidential campaign has struggled mightily to rekindle it two years later. 
And Republicans say they've found that Mr. Obama's visits around the country, even if they energize lethargic Democrats, also raise intensity among core Republicans who dislike the president the more they are reminded of him. 
Yet compared to other faces Democrats could present to voters in the stretch run, Mr. Obama represents the party's best bet. His job-approval rating stands at 46%, which isn't good, but is slightly above where President George W. Bush's approval stood at this point in 2006, when his Republican Party was about to take what he called a "thumpin' " in midterm elections. 
And beyond that job grade, a reasonably healthy 47% say they have positive feelings toward Mr. Obama. That's a higher positive rating than either Mr. Bush had in 2006, or President Bill Clinton had at this point in 1994, just before a Republican wave hit his presidency in midterm elections. 
More importantly, though, there isn't any other Democratic leader -- unless you count Mr. Clinton, now in the midst of a remarkable popularity renaissance -- who engenders similar positive vibes. In the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brought forth the highest negative feelings of any current political leader tested. A striking 50% said they have negative feelings about her, compared with just 22% who have positive feelings. 
And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid inspired positive feelings among just 15% of Americans, and negative feelings among 32%. Stunningly, after four years atop the Senate, the last two pushing one of the most ambitious legislative agendas in decades, Mr. Reid inspired no feelings at all among a third of Americans, who either don't know who he is or aren't sure what they think of him. 
Little wonder, then, that more Republican attack ads try to link Democrats with Ms. Pelosi than anybody else this cycle. 
The other problems the Democrats' congressional wing has created for the party arise from the work plan it has pursued over the last two years. Two examples: 
In June 2009, just six months into the Obama era, House leaders brought to a vote a broad, highly ambitious bill to attack climate change, in part by changing American energy habits and in part by instituting a new cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases. That bill presented an extraordinarily tough vote for lawmakers from coal-producing and industrial states, because the carbon cap was seen as a threat to both the coal industry and to energy and manufacturing plants across the upper Midwest. 
That might have been a political risk worth taking if the legislation was about to roar ahead on the wings of popular demand. Instead, House members cast this hard, politically risky vote on a bill that proceeded to go -- nowhere. The Senate not only didn't take up the bill, it moved on instead to health care, while a handful of senators sought to write a different version of climate-change legislation that failed to fly. 
So a handful of brave Democrats put their necks on the line for what has turned out to be a meaningless vote. Now those lawmakers -- Rick Boucher in Virginia and John Boccieri and Zack Space in Ohio most notably -- are being pilloried for their troubles. If those Democrats lose, and Democrats lose the House by a couple of seats, they can look back on cap-and-trade and wonder. 
Meanwhile over in the Senate, the August 2009 town-hall uprisings against the health-care overhaul then being debated might have been seen as a sign that Senate leaders ought to either scale back the legislation or get it passed quickly and return to core economic issues. Neither happened. Senate deliberations dragged on for four months, and a final bill wasn't completed for three additional months. 
Of course, Mr. Obama might have stepped in more forcefully to steer both climate-change and health legislation in different directions, and didn't. Still, it's little wonder the president was on the campaign trail in Ohio on Sunday, and is on his way to Oregon, Washington state, California, Nevada and Minnesota. He's still the best messenger his party has.

California's Cap-and-Trade War

Abstract 
Alternative energy investors realize that without new taxes on carbon energy and mandates for "renewables" like wind and solar, so-called clean energy sources can't compete. 

Full Text 
What happens when environmental fashion collides with a state's desperate need for jobs and economic growth? That question will be put to the test when Californians vote November 2 on a ballot measure that would suspend the Golden State's cap-and-trade law until its unemployment rate falls below 5.5%. Today the rate is 12.4%. 
Proposition 23 is the number one national target of the green movement this election year. With the failure of cap and tax in Congress, the greens are trying to hold onto this remnant of their anticarbon crusade. Both sides are spending heavily, and the polls show a close vote. 
California's climate change law (known as AB 32) mandates a 30% cut in carbon emissions from cars, trucks, utilities, agriculture and other businesses by 2020, with a web of new taxes and regulations that take effect in 2012. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sees AB 32 as his crowning achievement and is assailing supporters of Proposition 23 as "black oil hearts [who are] spending millions and millions of dollars" to promote their own "self-serving greed." 
In reality, dozens of industries support the initiative, and Arnold never mentions that much of the money to defeat Proposition 23 also comes from energy companies. Alternative energy investors realize that without new taxes on carbon energy and mandates for "renewables" like wind and solar, so-called clean energy sources can't compete. 
When AB 32 was signed in 2006, the California economy was flying high, the state unemployment rate was under 5%, and cap and trade seemed a fashionable luxury the state could afford. Not anymore. Today there are 2.5 million unemployed Californians and the state's finances are a wreck. AB 32 would make all of this worse. 
A 2009 study commissioned by the California Small Business Roundtable found that when fully implemented AB 32 would cost the state more than one million jobs and "result in a higher cost to California households of $3,857 per year." That's more than the typical California family pays each year in federal income tax. A new study by the Pacific Research Institute predicts job losses of 150,000 by 2012 and 1.3 million by 2020. 
Environmentalists counter that "green jobs" will save the day, as if a million Californians will make windmills and solar panels. California already leads the nation in regulations and subsidies to boost alternative energy, and it still has the third highest jobless rate in the nation. 
Voters are also told the law would reduce the state's carbon footprint and save the planet from global warming. Except it can't and it won't. No single state -- even one the size of California -- can reduce global emissions by unilaterally taxing and regulating. 
Even the California Air Resources Board, which supports AB 32, acknowledged this when it said in March that "California acting alone cannot reduce emissions sufficiently to change the course of climate change worldwide." The real objective, they said, is to set an example to move federal and international climate change legislation. But given that so many Democrats are now campaigning against cap and tax around the country, it's highly unlikely that Congress or many states will follow California. 
The state's own fiscal auditors admitted earlier this year that there will be economic "leakage" to other states and nations from AB 32, and that California's economy "will likely be adversely affected in the near term by implementing climate-related policies that are not adopted elsewhere." 
Most of this economic pain will be borne, not by wealthy liberals in Santa Barbara and San Francisco, but by middle class and poor Californians who work in industries whose costs will rise. No wonder a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that Hispanics are the group most opposed to AB 32. They seem to understand they will be first in line to get laid off when the law starts to bite. 
With so much at stake, Prop. 23 ought to be a major issue in this year's election campaign. Democratic candidates Jerry Brown (Governor) and Senator Barbara Boxer both oppose Prop. 23, but GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman is a fence-sitter. She calls cap and tax a job killer but favors only a one-year suspension. GOP Senate candidate Carly Fiorina is a full-throated supporter of the initiative. With her usual charm, Ms. Boxer accuses her of being "in the pocket of big oil" and "dirty coal." 
Proposition 23 faces an uphill fight against green moneyed interests, but its passage would give California a regulatory reprieve and save tens of thousands of jobs. If it fails, Nevadans and Chinese will rejoice.

China Turns to Texas for Drilling Know-How

Abstract 
The deal struck with Chesapeake Energy Corp. is driven by the Chinese state-controlled oil company's desire to both gain a foothold in a booming U.S. energy market and garner technology that could increase China's domestic energy supplies and reduce its reliance on coal-fired power plants, experts say. 

Full Text 
Cnooc Ltd. agreed to invest up to $2.16 billion in a Texas oil and natural-gas project in its first major return to the U.S. market after losing out on a deal to acquire a U.S. oil 
company five years ago. 
The deal struck with Chesapeake Energy Corp. is driven by the Chinese state-controlled oil company's desire to both gain a foothold in a booming U.S. energy market and 
garner technology that could increase China's domestic energy supplies and reduce its reliance on coal-fired power plants, experts say. 

Chesapeake is one of the pioneers in applying new drilling technologies to release oil and gas trapped in tight rock formations called shales. 

The deal will likely get a full, 75-day review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., said legal experts. But CFIUS -- the interagency body that vets foreign 
purchases of U.S. assets for threats to national security -- is unlikely to oppose the deal, they added. 
The proposed purchase as outlined would help expand energy production in the U.S. and any technology transfer to the Chinese would help them develop their own sources of 

oil and natural gas, they said. 

In 2005, Cnooc withdrew a multibillion-dollar bid for Unocal Corp. -- now part of Chevron Corp. -- amid national security worries in Washington, D.C. But last year, its acquisition 
of offshore fields in U.S. Gulf of Mexico waters was unopposed. 
Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon said in an interview that he expects few objections. The investment is evidence Chinese companies are "able to figure out a way 

to invest in the U.S. in a manner that is acceptable in the business community and acceptable to political leadership," Mr. McClendon said. 

Cnooc said it would pay Chesapeake Energy $1.08 billion for a one-third stake in a South Texas shale field rich in oil and natural gas. It could spend an additional $1.08 billion to 
shoulder 75% of the costs for developing the 600,000 acres involved. 
The project could produce the equivalent of up to 500,000 barrels of oil a day in the next decade, the companies said, and the partnership could give expansion-minded Cnooc 

the skills to crack rich, but hard-to-exploit oil-and-gas deposits in its domestic market. 
A final agreement is expected by year-end. 
Chesapeake has briefed policy makers and members of Congress, said spokesman Jim Gipson. Mr. Gipson said "the deal is consistent with U.S. policy priorities, may create up 

to 20,000 jobs in the U.S. and reduce our dependence on foreign oil." 

"For a whole host of reasons, there is no question that policy makers should want the Chinese to have shale [technologies]," said energy analyst Amy Myers Jaffe, at the Baker Institute Energy Forum at Rice University. Cnooc's shares jumped 4.5% Monday in Hong Kong on the prospect that the deal would enable the company to exploit energy-rich shale formations in China. Shale is an 
"increasingly popular form of unconventional oil and gas," said Lawrence Lau, an analyst with BOC International in Hong Kong. 
Chesapeake shares rose 1.1% to $23.30 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading. 
Technological advances allowing the development of vast reserves of natural gas trapped in shale formations along the U.S. East Coast, in North Dakota and Texas have 

transformed the U.S. energy sector in recent years. The discoveries triggered a wave of deal-making as big energy companies sought access to the technology and fields. 
Many foreign energy companies, keen on learning skills to tap the gas pioneered by U.S. companies like Chesapeake, have invested in U.S. projects, giving the projects much-

needed cash. Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. in June purchased a 45% stake in Pioneer Natural Resources Co.'s Texas natural-gas assets and has struck deals valued at about $2 billion for minority stakes in projects in the eastern U.S. Until now, China's sole foray into North American shale gas had been a nonbinding pact between China National Petroleum Corp. and Canada's Encana Corp. to set up a joint 
venture to exploit shale reserves in British Columbia. 
Pressure in China has been rising to tap gas deposits and other sources that burn more cleanly than coal, the nation's principal source of power but a significant emitter of gases that contribute to global warming. The International Energy Agency, the developed world's energy watchdog, says China has reserves of 26 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, which the country hasn't been able to 
tap because of a lack of drilling know-how. 
China's Ministry of Land and Resources wants domestic shale-gas output capacity to reach between 15 billion and 30 billion cubic meters a year by 2020, from negligible levels 

now. 
Cnooc Chairman Fu Chengyu said joining with Chesapeake "not only satisfies the spirit of Sino-U.S. cooperation in the energy sector, but also underscores Cnooc's responsible 
approach to climate-change issues and its social responsibilities." 

Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie says China's demand for imported liquefied natural gas will rise to 46 million metric tons a year in 2020 from 5.5 million tons last year. It 

forecasts that China's gas demand will rise to 444 billion cubic meters annually in 2030 from 93 billion cubic meters last year. 
Mirae Asset Securities analyst Gordon Kwan described the Chesapeake-Cnooc deal as a boost for cash-strapped Chesapeake that hasn't been able to fully exploit its vast 
natural-gas resources, and a solid investment for Cnooc, whose production growth had outpaced increases to its energy reserves in recent years. 

Chesapeake will be the operator of the joint project in Texas, handling all leasing and drilling operations, as well as selling the oil and gas produced. 
Chesapeake's Mr. McClendon said that Cnooc won't have any employees working at the site. "They'll have to watch from afar," he said. 
Chesapeake, one of the largest independent producers of oil and gas in the U.S., plans to use Cnooc's investment to increase the number of rigs drilling in South Texas to 12 

from 10 rigs by year-end. 
By the end of next year, Chesapeake expects to have 31 rigs, and by 2012, 40 rigs.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson isn't on any ballots this November. But in some parts of the country, she might as well be. 
Ms. Jackson's agency is becoming a foil for congressional candidates across the country. In South Dakota, Republican Kristi Noem has called for Ms. Jackson's resignation, citing the EPA's inaction on a request from ethanol producers to allow more ethanol in gasoline. In Arkansas, embattled Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln is blasting Ms. Jackson's agency for promulgating "overreaching, burdensome" regulations on pesticides used by 
farmers. 
In these states and others, Ms. Jackson's EPA has become a focal point of the argument about the role of federal regulation in the economy. Environmental and public-health 

groups that form an important part of the Democratic Party's constituency say a vigorous EPA is vital when Congress is deadlocked on environmental policy issues such as 
climate change. 
But for Republicans and for some Democrats, the EPA is a symbol of a government that does too much and discourages job-creating investments. "It represents government out 

of control," said Rep. Sanford Bishop, (D., Ga.) when asked to describe his constituents' view of the agency. 

Ms. Jackson has emerged as one of the Obama administration's most energetic regulators. During the past 18 months, the agency has proposed 42 "significant" regulations, 
according to OMB Watch, a left-leaning watchdog group. 
That compares with 16 in the first 18 months of the EPA during the George W. Bush administration. 
The government defines regulations as "significant" if they have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more or meet certain other criteria, such as raising new 

legal issues or interfering with other agencies' actions. 

The new rules seek to reduce ozone pollution from factories and cars; coal ash waste from power plants; storm-water runoff from construction sites; greenhouse-gas emissions 
from cars; and mercury emissions from industrial boilers. 
Ms. Jackson has noted that past warnings about the economic toll of environmental regulation have often overestimated the costs. When Congress debated legislation in 1990 to 

curb acid rain, EPA studies estimated the legislation's annual costs at between $2.7 and $4 billion a year. A decade later, an EPA analysis determined that the 1990 law cost $1 

billion to $2 billion. 
"We want an EPA that is working to protect our families and the places where we live, work and play -- not protecting big polluters and the status quo," a spokesman for Ms. 
Jackson said. 

The agency's critics say they are also looking out for ordinary Americans. In West Virginia and Virginia, Democratic Reps. Nick Rahall and Rick Boucher, respectively, are playing 

up their efforts to stop EPA rules that they say will kill mining jobs. 
Mr. Rahall's district is the focus of a particularly controversial EPA decision. In March, the agency proposed quashing a water permit needed for a coal-mining project there that 
the Bush administration approved three years ago. 

It's the first time in the EPA's 40-year history that the agency has proposed vetoing a water permit after it was issued. 
An EPA spokesman said the project "involves harmful impacts on the environment, wildlife and water quality on an enormous scale." 
Not all political candidates are attacking the EPA. In California's 44th district, Democrat Bill Hedrick has criticized incumbent Republican Rep. Ken Calvert for supporting 

legislation to block the EPA from regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Calvert said he voted for the legislation "to give Congress, regulators and stakeholders two years to 

develop a workable solution that protects American jobs." 
Ms. Jackson, meanwhile, is trying to soothe some of her critics. She met last month with ethanol producers, assuring them she was still considering their request to allow more 
ethanol in gasoline.

Abstract 
Backed by the government and supported by cheap loans from state-owned banks, Chinese companies have also pioneered development of electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and power plants that can burn coal more efficiently and store carbon emissions underground. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- The first round of international climate talks hosted by China highlights the biggest energy consumer's struggle to expand its role in global-warming policy while shining a spotlight on the country's ambitions and shortcomings in clean energy. 
Few analysts or participants expect groundbreaking developments from this week's talks, set to begin Monday in the northeastern Chinese port city of Tianjin. 
But they are seen as a chance to narrow differences between various countries ahead of a year-end United Nations summit in Cancun to find a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, 
the international treaty on global warming that expires in 2012. 

"At the Tianjin conference we aim to reduce the divergence as much as possible and try to achieve positive progress so as to contribute to the progress of the Cancun 

conference," Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, said last week. 
Last year's climate-change summit in Copenhagen ended acrimoniously with a last-minute nonbinding accord brokered by the U.S. and China, both of which had traded 
accusations of diplomatic snubs. 

The talks will also shine a spotlight on China's ambitions -- and shortcomings -- in clean energy at a time when the industry has emerged as a battleground between the China and the U.S. For now, climate-change legislation has been largely shelved in the U.S. Congress, but trade tensions have intensified over China's efforts to build up its green technology sector. 
When the Kyoto treaty was signed in 1997, China and other developing countries were exempted from limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. The U.S., which opposed that 
exemption, never ratified the treaty. 
Recently, China eclipsed the U.S. as the world's biggest energy user and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is also on track to surpass Japan this year as the world's 
second-largest economy after the U.S. 

At the same time, China has become a superpower in clean-energy technologies such as solar and wind power. Six of the world's top ten photovoltaic-solar-panel makers are based in China, according to consultancy iSuppli, and China exports 90% of domestic production. China also has the world's highest new installed capacity of wind-power turbines. 
"The importance of new energy to China could be equivalent to energy-efficient cars for Japan in the 1970s and the [personal computer] industry for the U.S. throughout the 
1980s and 1990s," Credit Suisse said in a September report. 
Backed by the government and supported by cheap loans from state-owned banks, Chinese companies have also pioneered development of electric vehicles, advanced 
batteries, and power plants that can burn coal more efficiently and store carbon emissions underground. 

While many analysts see China's strength in clean technology as helpful for the effort to rein in emissions, its policies have also stirred opposition. Critics say it gives Chinese 

firms unfair advantages and violates international trade treaties. 
That criticism could further complicate climate talks. One of the key issues for China is securing a mechanism to help fund clean-technology transfers from rich countries to 
poorer ones -- but the very success of China's green companies could undermine China's claims to be a developing country in need of further assistance. 

The Tianjin talks will also bring into focus the policy commitments China has made to reduce its carbon footprint. 

China committed last year to cut carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product by at least 40% from 2005 levels by 2020, and Chinese officials plan to enshrine that 
pledge into their 12th five-year economic plan, the country's economic blueprint set to start in 2011. 
Activists say these actions have given China greater stature in the talks, while the U.S. has lost credibility after failing to move on climate legislation. The two countries account 

for a combined 40% of world emissions of carbon dioxide. 
But China is struggling to meet a goal of increasing energy efficiency 20% by the end of 2010 from 2005 levels. 
And despite its efforts, carbon emissions are soaring so fast that some analysts say that by 2030 China will have emitted more carbon in total than the U.S. ever had in history.

40 Years of Energy Panic

Abstract 
Turn on the TV: ethanol, hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, coal, offshore drilling, onshore drilling, wind, natural gas. [...] whole careers in the public eye are being built on the idea of peak oil -- a geological conceit that produces scenarios of global catastrophe only because it omits the price mechanism, which has worked well for a century to adapt the world economy to whatever amount of oil is geologically available at a given time. 

Full Text 
The scene was a Senate hearing last November, before the Gulf oil spill. To his credit (and unlike a BP exec seated nearby), Shell's Marvin Odum went on about the risk of spills, the history of spills, the response to spills. 
Then he launched into a section that began: "The U.S. imports approximately 60% of its petroleum needs. This is not necessary. . . . We should not be satisfied with having other nations produce their energy for our use." 
No, our point isn't that fear of foreigners is being used by Big Oil to con us into taking unacceptable environmental risks. If anything, BP's success in recapping the Macondo well suggests that, had a reliable blowout preventer been installed in the first place, BP's numerous errors needn't have resulted in any spill at all. Rather, our point is that the endless invocation of an alleged energy crisis is used to sell deep-water drilling because it's used to sell everything. 
Turn on the TV: ethanol, hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, coal, offshore drilling, onshore drilling, wind, natural gas. Inflicted on us relentlessly since the 1970s, the most mischievous and misleading trope in American politics is the idea that our energy supplies are in danger, that foreigners are out to get us, that a crisis is upon us. 
What exactly has been the record of poor, pitiful us during this time? 
We seem to get all the oil we want at a price we're willing to pay. For three decades, our economy enjoyed one of its greatest boom periods ever -- a boom that ended, ironically, not because of oil shortages, but because of overspending on giant houses far from town by people happily conditioned by the ubiquity and affordability of their energy supplies. 
And look at countries even more dependent on oil imports than ours. China and India have inaugurated two of the greatest growth stories in history. Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, much of Western Europe -- states notorious for a paucity of natural resources -- have built among the highest sustained living standards on the globe. 
Some confused persons still think we invaded Iraq to get its oil, which would have been like spending a dollar to get a penny. Saddam would have sold us all the oil we wanted (and Kuwait's too) if we had just left him alone. 
Now whole careers in the public eye are being built on the idea of peak oil -- a geological conceit that produces scenarios of global catastrophe only because it omits the price mechanism, which has worked well for a century to adapt the world economy to whatever amount of oil is geologically available at a given time. 
This isn't to say that oil isn't a political problem maker. Villains like Saddam want to steal it. As a fount of domestic patronage, it spoils, corrupts and degrades societies where control is handed to politicians. But for the rest of us, that corruption is mainly visited via policies peddled domestically with a heavy dose of energy panic. 
Take the two scandals dogging BP lately. Britain's craven behavior toward a terrorism-sponsoring Libya partly arose from an exaggerated notion of Britain's stake in Libyan oil. The British, like us, have had no trouble buying all the oil they want on world markets. 
And, in retrospect, the obvious question raised by the Macondo blowout is why anyone would bet their company by drilling in ultra-deep water where the consequences of a blowout can't quickly and economically be contained. 
It turns out that one reason is the now-famous Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which capped oil-spill liability partly out of fears of jeopardizing the nation's energy. Even so, when the bill was debated, shipowners warned that any substantial liability at all might kill the global oil trade. 
Well, if not in law then in practice, the cap has been repealed. We'll soon see on what terms shareholders and insurance markets are willing to back the search for oil in deep waters. Guess what? By properly pricing the risks of a deep-water blowout, we're likely to get much safer drilling. 
Would that all our energy choices were allowed to work the same way, undistorted by rampant intervention premised on the false notion that the global oil market has proved to be anything other than what it is: robust, reliable, unfailing, if frequently volatile. 
Even the greenies might be better off -- Americans might be more amenable to modest energy taxes to fight global warming (if that's your cup of tea) if not preached into constant fear of energy shortages. Someday it will behoove a professor to write a book about the greatest failed political marriage of all time -- the marriage of the global warming crowd with the energy panic crowd. 
Look how little it has achieved despite commanding the airwaves, the media and nearly universal assent from the great and good. Why the marriage failed so abysmally is a question for another day. For now, it suffices simply to notice that it has.

Energy (Special Report): Producers --- Turning Away From Coal: Utilities are increasingly looking to natural gas to generate electricity

Abstract 
[...] the country doesn't have enough domestic gas to support a large-scale shift to that fuel, although government agencies are considering increasing imports of liquefied natural gas to take advantage of a growing global glut. [...] CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., had planned to seek regulatory approval in August to build an 830-megawatt "clean coal" power plant in Bay City, Mich. 

Full Text 
Power companies are increasingly switching to natural gas to fuel their electricity plants, driven by low prices and forecasts of vast supplies for years to come. 
While the trend started in the late 1990s, the momentum is accelerating and comes at the expense of coal. Some utilities are closing coal-fired plants; others are converting them to run on gas. 
The switch is occurring globally and is getting a push from regulators who want to limit emissions that contribute to climate change, haze and health problems such as respiratory illness. Though efforts in Congress to pass legislation attaching a price to carbon emissions appear stalled for now, utilities still anticipate eventual carbon restrictions. The Tennessee Valley Authority, for example, recently announced a 20-year development plan that emphasizes nuclear and gas, and includes fewer coal units. 
"It's pretty clear that, whether it's caused by future carbon legislation or action by the EPA, the migration away from coal has begun," says Constellation Energy Group Chief Executive Mayo Shattuck. 
Coal-burning facilities are expected to slip to 10% of total new capacity in the U.S. in 2013, down from 18% in 2009, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports. Gas, meanwhile, is expected to soar to 82% of new capacity in 2013 from 42% last year. 
Natural gas also has the edge in Europe. In 2009, far more gas- than coal-burning plants were built in the European Union -- 24% of new capacity versus 8.7%. 
In China and India, though, no such shift is occurring -- yet. Both nations rely on coal -- an abundant local resource -- for most of their power and lack the sort of integrated gas-pipeline networks that make switching to gas possible in the U.S. China's government has pledged to roughly double the percentage of electricity the country gets from non-fossil sources, to 15% from 8%, by 2020. But much of that new energy will come from hydropower. India, meanwhile, has agreed to cut its carbon emissions 20% from 2005 levels by 2020. But the country doesn't have enough domestic gas to support a large-scale shift to that fuel, although government agencies are considering increasing imports of liquefied natural gas to take advantage of a growing global glut. 
The falling price of natural gas in the U.S., to about $4 per one million British thermal units, has helped gas capture an ever-increasing share of power generation. Hardly a week goes by without a company announcing changes that push coal to the sidelines, usually in favor of natural gas, renewables or nuclear plants. 
Most big coal-burning utilities have invested billions of dollars to install pollution-control equipment on their largest coal-fired plants. But they are replacing or idling smaller coal plants for which such expenditures can't be justified. 
In August, Xcel Energy Inc., based in Minneapolis, notified regulators it wants to close a coal-burning plant in Boulder, Colo., and convert four units at its Cherokee plant in Denver to burn natural gas instead of coal. Xcel says the changes would cost the company $1.3 billion but still would be $225 million cheaper than installing pollution-control equipment on the aging coal units. 
The program should help satisfy Colorado state goals to reduce releases of nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury. The state is reviewing Xcel's plan, which the utility says could raise customer bills an average of 1% annually for several years. 
Calpine Corp., Houston, says it will convert to gas some of the coal-fired plants in Delaware and New Jersey that it is buying from Pepco Holdings Inc., in a $1.65 billion deal. The units are older plants that are in need of upgrades. Calpine says it can change the burners for less than it would cost to add pollution-control equipment like scrubbers. 
Progress Energy Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., intends to close four coal-burning plants and replace two of them with gas-fired plants by 2017. The company says it's cheaper to build gas-fired plants than it is to outfit the coal units with the necessary pollution-control equipment. 
Other utilities are backing away from coal projects because the recession is giving them more breathing room to figure out other ways to meet future energy needs. 
For example, CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., had planned to seek regulatory approval in August to build an 830-megawatt "clean coal" power plant in Bay City, Mich. But it has indefinitely deferred the project, citing slack electricity demand and a forecast for continued low natural-gas prices. As a result, the company says, it's cheaper to buy electricity from others than to build a $2 billion coal plant. 
"We're going to monitor the gas market," says CMS spokesman Jeff Holyfield. "But for now, it doesn't make sense." 
Not everyone is willing to give up on coal, of course. Many big coal-burning utilities are trying to find ways to use coal more cleanly. But even they have suffered setbacks. 
American Electric Power Co. failed in its bid, in July, to get Virginia customers to pay $54 million of the cost of creating an experimental carbon-capture-and-storage system at its Mountaineer coal-fired plant in West Virginia. The plant is owned by AEP's utilities in Virginia and West Virginia. But the Virginia utility commission said it wasn't fair to levy so much of the expense on Virginians when AEP customers in many other states who were not being charged stood to benefit, too. AEP, based in Columbus, Ohio, is appealing the decision. 
Duke Energy Corp. has been hurt by escalating costs at a state-of-the-art coal-gasification power plant under construction in Indiana. The Edwardsport plant, which is more than half complete, is expected to cost about $3 billion, or 50% more than the $2 billion original estimate. The new cost estimate exceeds the sum that Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke is being allowed to recover from customers. The Indiana commission was expected to hold hearings this month.

Full Text 
For investors, the energy business used to be a pretty simple play: Buy a stock and stick with it. 
Until a couple of years ago, soaring oil and natural-gas prices made any energy bet pay off. Not only did oil and gas stocks rise, but so did alternative-energy shares: With fossil fuels getting pricier, solar and wind power looked much more competitive. 
Then came the crash of 2008, and all that went out the window. These days, the energy sector is about as complicated as it gets, with a range of issues buffeting stock prices and making it tough to know where to put your money -- and when to do it. Not only is the economy playing havoc with demand and energy policy world-wide, but individual industries are facing complex challenges with very uncertain outcomes. 
Oil and gas producers, for instance, are grappling with the aftershocks of the BP PLC oil spill, at the same time they're facing a massive glut of natural gas that's driving down the price of the fuel. And alternative-energy companies in the U.S. are stuck in limbo. They were pinning their hopes on ambitious climate legislation to make fossil fuels more expensive -- but the bill stalled and likely won't be back on the table anytime soon. Overseas, governments are slashing the subsidies that alternative suppliers desperately need. 
Still, there's money to be made in the energy business -- if you know where to look. Below, we offer a few signposts to look for over the next year or so to help tap potential winners. 
Oil and Gas Producers 
When it comes to oil and natural gas, it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room: Many companies in this sector have been thrown for a loop by the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the effects of the disaster are likely to linger. Stephen Richardson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, sees increased costs for oil and gas producers as regulations tighten, which could hurt profit margins and even force some smaller companies to exit high-risk offshore projects. 
What should investors watch for? Federal officials have hinted at an early end to the deepwater-drilling moratorium, due to run until Nov. 30. If that comes to pass -- something that's by no means certain -- it could be a hopeful sign for drillers. 
Beyond this, investors will have to wait for the results of continuing investigations into the disaster and how to prevent future ones. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, for example, is due to issue its report in December. 
Another near-term factor to watch out for is further merger activity, which could potentially drive up stock prices. There has been a spate of deals involving larger companies buying smaller gas producers. Last December, Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to buy XTO Energy Inc. for $31 billion, the oil major's biggest deal in a decade. 
Still, there's an even bigger issue facing the industry than the Gulf spill: oversupply. 
Oil and gas producers have adopted and refined advanced drilling techniques enabling them to tap unconventional resources such as shale gas, trapped in dense rock thousands of feet underground. U.S. natural-gas reserves and production, after years of decline, are now back to levels last seen in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, U.S. gas consumption peaked in 2000 and fell 2% in 2009, as the recession damped demand. 
Extra supply has caused gas prices to tumble almost 30% in the past three years, hurting producers' profits and stock prices, with companies like Chesapeake Energy seeing big drops. Even though oil prices have more than doubled since February 2009, that has only partially offset the producers' losses. "The overriding question for exploration and production stocks is the future of the U.S. gas market and when oversupply ends," says Mr. Richardson. 
Low prices would usually spur producers to stop drilling and help rebalance the market, but that isn't happening for a variety of reasons, including lease conditions and the sector's natural bias toward growth. Jonathan Wolff at Credit Suisse calculates that for every dollar of cash flow producers make in 2010, they will reinvest $1.52 on average. 
One way investors can gauge the industry is to track the number of U.S. drilling rigs in operation, particularly "horizontal" rigs, which target shale gas. (The easiest way to find this tally is on the website of oil-field-services company Baker Hughes Inc.; look for the "Rig Count" box on the site's main page.) If this number levels off or drops, it would indicate efforts to bring on new supplies were easing, helping to address the oversupply issue. 
If all this suggests avoiding the sector, Jonathan Waghorn, co-head of Investec's Global Energy Fund, posits a contrarian view. "Gas is hated" by investors, he says, which could present a buying opportunity for those willing to ride out near-term weakness. 
Mr. Waghorn argues that producers with the highest costs need a gas price of about $4 per million British thermal units to keep running. Today, the average gas price in the futures market for 2011 is about $4.70 per million BTUs. 
But developing new shale resources, which will be needed in the future, requires a much higher price -- $6 or more per million BTUs -- to deliver a suitable return on producers' investment. If developers don't think they can get that price, they won't go ahead with new gas projects -- which will limit new supply, tighten the market and cause the gas price to rise. 
For Mr. Waghorn, this suggests the risk of further big declines in gas prices is limited, with big potential for them to rise significantly over time, as higher prices will be needed to justify investment in new fields. 
But he sees potential for oil prices to fall substantially if the global economy sputters over the next 12 months and demand falters. So, investors should look for signs that demand for gas is recovering and that inventories of the fuel, currently very high, are declining. These data, and more, are published weekly at the Department of Energy's website, . 
There's one more long-term factor to consider. If Washington passes comprehensive climate-change legislation, including effective limits on carbon emissions, this could help redress the imbalance of natural-gas supply and demand. Gas emits about half as much carbon as coal when burned, so putting a cost on carbon would make gas more competitive versus coal. Gas demand would likely rise. 
Utilities 
Gas and government loom large in the outlook for electricity producers, too. Gas-fired plants provide 23% of America's power, and in much of the country set the market price for electricity. So, higher gas prices often mean higher profit margins for suppliers that own coal, nuclear or hydropower plants. Their fuel costs are often lower than those of suppliers relying on gas-fired plants, but market prices for electricity are still tied to the price of gas. 
Like the gas producers, utilities have been hoping an economic rebound would fire up demand for energy. Further help was supposed to come from Washington in the form of comprehensive climate-change legislation. The hope was that by making carbon-intensive fuels like coal more expensive, the new rules would force many such power plants to shut down and tighten electrical capacity -- raising prices and profits. 
But a lack of legislation and slack demand has complicated that picture. Indeed, analysts at Barclays Capital believe demand for electricity will not return to prerecession levels for some years yet, weighing on prices. 
Greg Gordon, who heads Morgan Stanley's utilities-research team, reckons this environment favors regulated utilities, which have their rates set periodically by state officials with the aim of allowing the utilities to make a decent return on their investment. (Merchant generators, in contrast, take a market price for their electricity, and diversified utilities have both regulated and unregulated businesses.) 
Over the past year, regulated-utility stocks have risen 17%, compared with just a 2% rise for the MSCI World Utilities Index overall. Driving the growth: low gas prices and Treasury yields. Low fuel costs keep prices down and regulators happy. Low yields, meanwhile, make regulated utilities' dividends attractive to investors. 
Neil Wynne at Sanford C. Bernstein calculates that over the past 40 years, regulated utilities have on average beaten the S&P 500 during 12-month periods of falling inflation, such as we have now. He writes that the evidence suggests strongly that "utilities would function well as defensive investments in the event of further disinflation or eventual deflation." 
So, keeping an eye on where the consumer price index is going could help investors decide which utility stocks to buy and sell. Investors who believe in falling inflation or outright deflation should consider investing in stocks of regulated utilities. Those taking the opposite view, that the economic recovery will strengthen, and with it gas prices, might do better to bet on merchant generators and diversified utilities. 
A caveat: Should tax rates on dividends rise substantially at the end of the year, it could hurt regulated-utility stocks. That said, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Eggers argues that if you compare the stocks' dividend yields with bond and Treasury yields, the sector already is pricing in a reset in the tax rate to more than 30% from today's 15%. 
Nuclear Power 
Decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl disasters, nuclear power is generating renewed interest these days, thanks in large part to one simple fact: Nuclear plants do not emit carbon dioxide. Some 60 nuclear reactors are under construction around the world, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Investing directly in nuclear power's renaissance is not straightforward, however. Utilities that own nuclear plants often hold a variety of other types as well, which dilutes your exposure. Likewise, construction and engineering firms that build new plants do not focus just on the nuclear-power sector. 
Then there's timing. Nuclear plants take many years to construct, in part because of high regulatory hurdles but also the costs involved, with Standard & Poor's putting the average bill at upward of $7.5 billion. 
There are some nearer-term opportunities. "The real way to play nuclear right now is mining," says Ben Elias, an analyst at Sterne Agee. Uranium prices joined in the commodities bubble of a few years ago, hitting nearly $140 per pound in 2007, according to Ux Consulting Co. Today, the price is about $47. 
Mr. Elias says this price reflects the fact that utilities, the main buyers, have big stockpiles right now. Looking ahead, he sees the uranium market tightening as China and India, which account for almost half the world's nuclear plants under construction, come to market to secure supplies. Canadian miner Cameco Corp., for example, plans to double its uranium output by 2018. 
In the near term, investors should watch for any news out of China or India that they are signing long-term supply contracts for uranium, which could be a sign that the market is about to heat up. 
And while new nuclear-power plants can take a decade to be approved and built, there is money to be made in the meantime refitting old stations to increase their output. Since the start of 2000, the NRC has approved 82 of these so-called uprates. Shaw Group Inc., which provides uprating services for nuclear plants, estimates the domestic market alone at $25 billion in revenue. 
Wind Power 
In keeping with its name, the outlook for the wind-power industry seems "up in the air," says Geoff Styles, who runs energy consultancy GSW Strategy Group, based in Vienna, VA. 
Wind-power stocks surged along with the rest of renewables from 2006 into 2008, and then crashed with the broader market in late 2008 -- and have suffered since. So far this year, the sector is down 19%. 
What's going on? The credit crunch has raised financing costs and made it difficult to justify building new wind farms in the U.S. and Europe. Weak demand for electricity also means fewer turbines are needed to meet renewable-energy targets. 
Another big factor: U.S. political commitment to reining in carbon emissions has wavered. A comprehensive energy bill would have made renewable-energy technologies more competitive as the price of electricity produced from fossil fuels like coal increased. This now looks unlikely, "at least until next year," says Mr. Styles. Meanwhile, in a recent note to clients, Jason Mitchell, a manager at hedge fund GLG Partners, says a "lack of long-term U.S. energy policy" hinders investment there. 
The result of all this: Over the next three years, analysts at UBS expect global wind-power capacity to grow 19% annually, down from 27% annual growth over the past five years. That sounds pretty healthy. But those faster, earlier growth rates have attracted new competitors into the market. In China, for example, foreign manufacturers have seen their share of new installations shrink to just 13% in 2009 from about 80% in 2004, according to Goldman Sachs. 
Aside from the potential passage of a climate-change bill, which would give the industry a big lift, what can investors watch for? One trend to keep an eye on amid all this uncertainty is which turbine makers are getting the most orders. UBS expects larger companies with better technology, economies of scale and access to bank financing, such as Germany's Siemens AG and China's Goldwind Science & Technology, to take market share. Goldman, meanwhile, thinks smaller companies may be forced to sell themselves in the merger market. 
Solar Power 
Similar to the wind sector, solar-power stocks have seen a boom-and-bust cycle in the past three years. Down 14%, solar has been the second-worst-performing renewable-energy sector so far this year, behind wind. "Fundamentally, these are more expensive, less reliable forms of energy," says Mr. Styles of GSW Strategy Group. 
And when it comes to renewables, solar is often far more expensive than wind. Without subsidies, wind power costs $50 to $100 per megawatt-hour, according to Goldman Sachs. That's competitive with some coal- and gas-fired plants. The cost of solar power, however, starts at $90 per megawatt-hour and ranges up to $200, even though equipment costs have fallen rapidly in recent years. 
Little wonder, then, that the financial crisis has tempered the pace of development. This year, solar capacity totaling 12,000 megawatts is due to be installed globally, says Lazard Capital Markets. That's more than seven times the level of 2006. But new capacity next year is pegged at 14,500 megawatts, a distinct slowdown in the growth rate. 
What's more, governments have been reining in subsidies for solar power. Solar stocks were weighed down in the first half of 2010 as Germany, the world's biggest solar market, began negotiating such cuts. But Mark Wienkes, a Goldman analyst, says that this had more to do with the falling cost of solar power than austerity measures. Solar stocks have recovered some ground since Germany announced subsidy plans in June. 
Growth markets over the next year are likely to include the U.S., Italy, China, France and Japan, says Lazard. Of these, China could offer the biggest positive surprise if, as expected, Beijing introduces a "feed-in tariff," effectively a guaranteed minimum electricity price for renewable-energy producers. A decision is expected next year. 
Investors should also look at which bits of the solar industry are over- or under-supplied, says Chris Ruppel, a banker with investment bank Execution Noble, based in Greenwich, Ct. He explains that while there is excess capacity for producing solar panels, for example, supplies of inverters, which convert the direct current produced by the panels to the alternating current used in homes, are tight.

Abstract 
Though it said the organization is "successful overall," it suggested a number of changes to the IPCC's managerial structure and to its vetting process designed to reduce errors and bias creeping into the IPCC's widely watched reports. Mr. Pachauri "was going to be a lower-key chair," said a former Bush administration official involved in international climate negotiations at the time. 

Full Text 
In 2002, when Rajendra Pachauri was elected head of the world's top climate-science body, Al Gore and other environmentalists condemned him as a favorite of the fossil-fuel industry. 
Today, the 70-year-old chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is under fire for the opposite offense: being a green zealot. 
On Monday, the InterAcademy Council, a consortium of national scientific academies, released its report on its investigation into the IPCC under Mr. Pachauri's leadership. Though it said the organization is "successful overall," it suggested a number of changes to the IPCC's managerial structure and to its vetting process designed to reduce errors and bias creeping into the IPCC's widely watched reports. 
Mr. Pachauri said the recommendations were in line with reforms he has tried to institute already. They are "essentially an intensification, a detailing, of what I've wanted to do myself," he said in an interview Monday. 
Mr. Pachauri was pressured to request the probe after mistakes were disclosed in an IPCC report that helped win the panel the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. 
Mr. Pachauri was an unlikely general in the war on global warming. He started his career in an Indian diesel-locomotive factory. As an academic, he staunchly defended his country's right to burn coal. 
But over the years he underwent a transformation and became convinced of the dangers of global warming. He voiced strong convictions that later exposed him to a more intense backlash when the handful of problems with the IPCC's work came to light. 
He made high-profile statements playing down uncertainties about global warming. He added new responsibilities, becoming director of an energy institute at Yale University, even as his IPCC workload increased. And when his organization faced criticism for errors, he initially argued the IPCC could investigate itself. 
After the IPCC won the Nobel, he "became a bit of a global rock star," said Daniel Esty, a Yale professor and friend of the IPCC chairman. "I think he got spread very thin and personally should have been more careful in overseeing the team below him" managing IPCC scientific work. 
Mr. Pachauri said that the IPCC "is a very decentralized organization," and that the production of its reports is overseen by highly competent scientists who "wouldn't appreciate the chairman looking over their shoulders and trying to look for errors." 
Mr. Pachauri receives travel expenses but no salary as IPCC chairman. His paid job is as head of a New Delhi think tank, The Energy Research Institute, or TERI. He has advised several Indian and Western companies during his IPCC tenure, but says he has given the money he has received for that work to TERI. A KPMG audit, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, confirms that about most of the money. It doesn't address a small amount, which he says he gave to charity. 
The investigative report released Monday called for the IPCC to implement a conflict-of-interest policy for its chairman and other top officials. The IPCC needs to "maintain the integrity of, and public confidence in, its results," the report said. 
Mr. Pachauri was born in 1940 in Nainital, a town in India that looks out onto the Himalayas. Everything in his early career suggested support for fossil fuels. In his late 20s, he managed the production of train engines at an Indian factory. In his 30s, at North Carolina State University, he wrote a doctoral dissertation on ways that some coal-dependent states could cheaply meet rising electricity demand. 
In 1982, he became the head of TERI. He still holds the job nearly three decades later, earning an annual salary equivalent to about $46,000. 
The IPCC was founded by the United Nations in 1988. Mr. Pachauri's involvement was hardly surprising, since he was a prominent energy expert in one of the fastest growing countries in the world. 
In 1997, he successfully ran against an incumbent to become one of the IPCC's vice chairmen. In 2002, he challenged the IPCC's then-chairman and won. 
The George W. Bush administration backed Mr. Pachauri, in part, as a less strident environmentalist than the IPCC's prior chairman. Mr. Pachauri "was going to be a lower-key chair," said a former Bush administration official involved in international climate negotiations at the time. 
Within days of Mr. Pachauri's election as IPCC leader, Mr. Gore assailed him in a New York Times op-ed piece. The former vice president cited the Bush administration's backing of Mr. Pachauri as a reason for concern. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Gore said he wouldn't comment. Mr. Pachauri said the two are now good friends. 
Mr. Gore had reason to soften on Mr. Pachauri. He became "an advocate for emissions controls that are a lot more radical than he was talking about or almost anyone was talking about 10 years ago," said David Victor, an international-energy expert at the University of California, San Diego. 
Mr. Pachauri's views were on full display in his Nobel address in 2007, when he warned climate change could cause "chaos and destruction." Mr. Pachauri says such language is deliberate. "If you want people to take action, then you obviously would make the arguments that require a certain set of actions." 
Monday's report found that some summaries the IPCC wrote of its 2007 climate-change findings failed to adequately reflect scientific uncertainty. One of the summaries contained claims "that are not supported sufficiently in the literature, not put into perspective, or not expressed clearly," it said. 
Daniel Sperling, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who contributed to the 2007 IPCC report, said of Mr. Pachauri: "He obviously wasn't sensitive enough to some of these uncertainties." 
Mr. Pachauri says neither the most recent report nor other recent climate-science probes have questioned the IPCC's overall conclusion about the dangers and causes of climate change. 
The IPCC controversy was sparked in November 2009 when more than 1,000 hacked emails from a climate-research center at the University of East Anglia were posted online. The emails showed some climate scientists involved in IPCC reports trying to squelch criticism of the conclusion that humans are causing climate change. 
Weeks later, IPCC officials were confronted with a factual error in their 2007 report: a projection that Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. Climate scientists say it is essentially impossible to project the demise of a glacier by a particular year. 
Within days, Mr. Pachauri and his top IPCC lieutenants issued a statement expressing "regret" over the claim. But criticism mounted, and by mid-February the IPCC informed governments it would appoint a committee to investigate itself. A few weeks later, Mr. Pachauri asked an outside agency, the InterAcademy Council, to conduct the probe.

AFGHANISTAN 
Seven U.S. Troops Die 
In Roadside Bombings 
Roadside bombs killed seven American service members in Afghanistan, including five in a blast in Kandahar, raising to more than a dozen the number who have died in the past 

three days. 
NATO gave no details of the Monday blasts except that they occurred in the south and that five were killed in a single blast. 
Witnesses said the five died when a bomb struck a Humvee on a main road on the outskirts of Kandahar, the focus of a military campaign to secure the city that the Taliban 

used as its headquarters during its years in power. 

Meanwhile, a district governor in the eastern province of Nangarhar, Sayad Mohammad Palawan, was killed when a bomb planted on his vehicle exploded as he was driving to a meeting of provincial security and political leaders, police said. -- Associated Press 
JAPAN Government Considers Increasing Fossil-Fuel Tax The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it plans to propose raising taxes on fossil fuels to fund initiatives to fight climate change, beginning in the fiscal year starting 
April 2011. 
The tax plan, which is at its earliest stages and would need to be passed by lawmakers, could accelerate the decline in Japan's energy demand by spurring consumers to cut 
back on fossil fuels. Japan is the world's third-largest consumer of crude oil after the U.S. and China, and its imports of other fossil fuels, such as thermal coal and natural gas, 

are an important source of income for regional trade partners. Japan's energy demand is falling sharply as its population ages and as the use of energy-efficient technologies 
becomes more widespread.

SOMALIA 
Ugandan Peacekeepers 
Are Killed in Mortar Attack 
A mortar fired by al Qaeda-linked insurgents slammed into Somalia's presidential palace, killing four Ugandan peacekeepers as clashes between militants and pro-government 

forces entered a second week. 
The mortar, which also injured eight people, didn't land near the president's house, said a spokesman for the African Union, who confirmed the deaths of the four Ugandans. 
The strike against the palace comes a week after al Shabab militants stormed a hotel near the presidential palace and killed 32 people.

SOUTH AFRICA 
Pay Offer Increased For Striking Workers The government increased its wage raise offer to unions representing 1.3 million striking state workers, a person familiar with the offer said on Monday, trying to end a strike 
that threatens Africa's largest economy. 
The offer came in talks arranged after President Jacob Zuma ordered ministers to negotiate immediately to end the nearly three-week-long walkout that has closed schools, 
prevented treatment at hospitals and harmed investor sentiment. 
The government lifted its offer for a wage increase to 8% from 7% and raised its offer for a monthly housing allowance to 800 rand ($109) from 700 rand, a person familiar 

with the union position told Reuters. Unions have been demanding 8.6% and 1,000 rand. -- Reuters 
VENEZUELA 
Hunger Striker Protesting 
Farm's Nationalization Dies 
A farmer who had been on a hunger strike for months in a protest against President Hugo Chavez's nationalization policies died Monday in a military hospital, his family said. 
The death of Franklin Brito, whose case had become a rallying point for opposition parties in Venezuela, comes amid rising political tensions ahead of a Sept. 26 parliamentary 

vote. 

Mr. Brito had been at a military hospital in Caracas since December, when he was picked up by authorities from a city square where he was camped out in protest. Venezuelan 
officials said Mr. Brito was mentally unstable and accused the political opposition of trying to exploit his case. 
Mr. Brito's 59 acres of yucca and watermelon plants in Bolivar state were seized in 2003, part of the 6.2 million acres expropriated in recent years by the government.

Abstract 
[...] wind-generated electricity largely displaces power produced by natural gas-fired generators, rather than that from plants burning more carbon-intensive coal. Because wind blows intermittently, electric utilities must either keep their conventional power plants running all the time to make sure the lights don't go dark, or continually ramp up and down the output from conventional coal- or gas-fired generators (called "cycling"). 

Full Text 
The wind industry has achieved remarkable growth largely due to the claim that it will provide major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. There's just one problem: It's not true. A slew of recent studies show that wind-generated electricity likely won't result in any reduction in carbon emissions -- or that they'll be so small as to be almost meaningless. 
This issue is especially important now that states are mandating that utilities produce arbitrary amounts of their electricity from renewable sources. By 2020, for example, California will require utilities to obtain 33% of their electricity from renewables. About 30 states, including Connecticut, Minnesota and Hawaii, are requiring major increases in the production of renewable electricity over the coming years. 
Wind -- not solar or geothermal sources -- must provide most of this electricity. It's the only renewable source that can rapidly scale up to meet the requirements of the mandates. This means billions more in taxpayer subsidies for the wind industry and higher electricity costs for consumers. 
None of it will lead to major cuts in carbon emissions, for two reasons. First, wind blows only intermittently and variably. Second, wind-generated electricity largely displaces power produced by natural gas-fired generators, rather than that from plants burning more carbon-intensive coal. 
Because wind blows intermittently, electric utilities must either keep their conventional power plants running all the time to make sure the lights don't go dark, or continually ramp up and down the output from conventional coal- or gas-fired generators (called "cycling"). But coal-fired and gas-fired generators are designed to run continuously, and if they don't, fuel consumption and emissions generally increase. A car analogy helps explain: An automobile that operates at a constant speed -- say, 55 miles per hour -- will have better fuel efficiency, and emit less pollution per mile traveled, than one that is stuck in stop-and-go traffic. 
Recent research strongly suggests how this problem defeats the alleged carbon-reducing virtues of wind power. In April, Bentek Energy, a Colorado-based energy analytics firm, looked at power plant records in Colorado and Texas. (It was commissioned by the Independent Petroleum Association of the Mountain States.) Bentek concluded that despite huge investments, wind-generated electricity "has had minimal, if any, impact on carbon dioxide" emissions. 
Bentek found that thanks to the cycling of Colorado's coal-fired plants in 2009, at least 94,000 more pounds of carbon dioxide were generated because of the repeated cycling. In Texas, Bentek estimated that the cycling of power plants due to increased use of wind energy resulted in a slight savings of carbon dioxide (about 600 tons) in 2008 and a slight increase (of about 1,000 tons) in 2009. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated the potential savings from a nationwide 25% renewable electricity standard, a goal included in the Waxman-Markey energy bill that narrowly passed the House last year. Best-case scenario: about 306 million tons less CO2 by 2030. Given that the agency expects annual U.S. carbon emissions to be about 6.2 billion tons in 2030, that expected reduction will only equal about 4.9% of emissions nationwide. That's not much when you consider that the Obama administration wants to cut CO2 emissions 80% by 2050. 
Earlier this year, another arm of the Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, released a report whose conclusions were remarkably similar to those of the EIA. This report focused on integrating wind energy into the electric grid in the Eastern U.S., which has about two-thirds of the country's electric load. If wind energy were to meet 20% of electric needs in this region by 2024, according to the report, the likely reduction in carbon emissions would be less than 200 million tons per year. All the scenarios it considered will cost at least $140 billion to implement. And the issue of cycling conventional power plants is only mentioned in passing. 
Coal emits about twice as much CO2 during combustion as natural gas. But wind generation mostly displaces natural gas, because natural gas-fired generators are often the most costly form of conventional electricity production. Yet if regulators are truly concerned about reducing carbon emissions and air pollution, they should be encouraging gas-fired generation at the expense of coal. And they should be doing so because U.S. natural gas resources are now likely large enough to meet all of America's natural gas needs for a century. 
Meanwhile, the wind industry is pocketing subsidies that dwarf those garnered by the oil and gas sector. The federal government provides a production tax credit of $0.022 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by wind. That amounts to $6.44 per million BTU of energy produced. In 2008, however, the EIA reported subsidies to oil and gas totaled $1.9 billion per year, or about $0.03 per million BTU of energy produced. Wind subsidies are more than 200 times as great as those given to oil and gas on the basis of per-unit-of-energy produced. 
Perhaps it comes down to what Kevin Forbes, the director of the Center for the Study of Energy and Environmental Stewardship at Catholic University, told me: "Wind energy gives people a nice warm fuzzy feeling that we're taking action on climate change." Yet when it comes to CO2 emissions, "the reality is that it's not doing much of anything."

Full Text 
The Obama administration Thursday awarded $1 billion to an Illinois project that aims to sharply reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, the latest in a long-running saga aimed at proving coal's viability amid widespread pressure to combat climate change. 
The new project, known as "FutureGen 2.0," replaces an earlier plan to build a first-of-a kind, "clean coal" power plant in Illinois using a different technology. Supporters of the latest version say it will create jobs and reduce greenhouse-gas pollution. Opponents contend it is a waste of money and thinly veiled reward for President Barack Obama's home state. 
The move is the latest development in the roller-coaster history of the concept, part of a controversial effort by Washington and the coal industry to prove that coal can be burned without releasing heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere. The George W. Bush administration launched the first incarnation of FutureGen in 2003, only to cancel it five years later, citing cost overruns. 
The project got a new shot last year with the inauguration of Mr. Obama, who supported the venture as an Illinois senator and vowed repeatedly on the campaign stump to support "clean-coal" projects. 
The U.S. Energy Department said the money would go to the FutureGen Alliance, the same group that backed the original "clean coal" project, along with Ameren Corp., Babcock & Wilcox and Air Liquide Process & Construction Inc. The money will help retrofit a now-shuttered Ameren coal-fired power plant in the western Illinois town of Meredosia and help establish a pipeline network to transport and store more than one million tons of carbon-dioxide a year in Mattoon, Ill., the site of the original project. 
"This was a great day for Illinois," Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) told reporters. 
Energy Secretary Steven Chu added that the award will help position the U.S. as "a leader in an important part of the global clean-energy economy." 
The decision drew criticism from Sen. Tom Coburn, the Oklahoma Republican, who said it "appears to have more to do with politics and geography than science." He added: "Taxpayers are being forced to finance the largest pork-barrel project in our nation's history with borrowed money." 
An Energy Department spokesman defended the project's location, saying Mattoon's geological characteristics make it the best site in the country to build such a facility. "This is a site that can handle 50 million tons of CO2 per year for 50 years," he said. 
The project represents the first commercial-scale demonstration of advanced oxy-combustion technology. Oxy-combustion burns coal with a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide instead of air to produce a concentrated carbon-dioxide stream for "safe, permanent storage," the department said. 
If successfully applied, the technology could help existing coal-fired power plants reduce greenhouse-gas emissions without shifting to natural gas, and also meet proposed tougher new Environmental Protection Agency regulations of traditional pollutants such as mercury. 
The original FutureGen project was intended to be the first commercial-scale project that combined technology to capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions with coal gasification, a process where heat and pressure are applied to coal, creating a synthetic gas that fuels turbines to generate electricity. FutureGen leaders struggled to line up backers and some members of the alliance pulled out in order to start their own projects.

Abstract 
According to investment bank UBS, heavy industry accounts for 56% of China's energy consumption, and only 28% of GDP. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- China's energy efficiency improved in the second quarter of this year, according to new government data, following a crackdown on wasteful industries initiated earlier this year by alarmed leaders. 
The data issued Tuesday hardly paint a rosy picture. China's consumption of energy relative to economic output increased for the first half of the year by 0.09% from the year-earlier period, the National Bureau of Statistics said. But that pace was much slower than the 3.2% increase in energy intensity -- or the fuel used per dollar of gross domestic product -- China reported for the first quarter, suggesting an improvement in the April-June period. 
Observers are looking at China's ability to meet its energy-efficiency targets as a test of its commitment to curb emissions of global-warming gases. China last year promised to cut the amount of carbon emissions per dollar of economic output by 40% to 45% by 2020 compared with 2005 levels, although Beijing rebuffed calls to cap the absolute level of carbon emissions. China's energy efficiency and greenhouse-gas emissions are closely linked because China relies heavily on coal, which releases carbon into the atmosphere when burned. 
The impact of China's performance on the rest of the world has grown with its booming economy. China surpassed the U.S. in 2007 as the largest emitter of carbon, and last month the International Energy Agency said China passed the U.S. in 2009 as the top energy consumer. China disputed the IEA's findings, but even its own figures put it only slightly behind the U.S. 
China's government pledged to improve energy efficiency by 20% from 2005 to 2010. By 2009, the government said it had reduced energy use by nearly 16% relative to economic output, revising an earlier figure of 14.4%. 
But the efficiency goals were put into question after China's economic stimulus sparked a housing and infrastructure boom, leading to a jump in energy consumption by less-efficient sectors, such as steel production. According to investment bank UBS, heavy industry accounts for 56% of China's energy consumption, and only 28% of GDP. 
Many feared China would drop its promises while it tried to maintain economic growth. UBS estimates reaching the 20% efficiency target could require a reduction in GDP of as much as two percentage points. 
After the poor numbers for the first quarter were reported, Premier Wen Jiabao in May vowed to use an "iron hand" to reach the targets, and the government announced it would shut down inefficient factories in more than a dozen sectors, including steel, cement, leather and even the food additive monosodium glutamate. 
Part of the latest easing of energy use appears related to an overall economic slowdown following tightening measures by the government. Economic growth slowed to 10.3% in the second-quarter from a year earlier, down from 11.9% in the first quarter. When growth is more rapid, factories are more likely to use their least-efficient machinery to fill orders. 
The sudden improvement reported Tuesday also could fuel doubts about the reliability of China's official data. "Even if China's latest numbers are reasonably accurate -- and we believe they are -- China still has some work to do to convince international analysts of this fact," wrote Arthur Kroeber and Rosealea Yao of consultancy GaveKalDragonomics.

The Death of Cap and Tax

Abstract 
[...] the bill went down for lack of Democratic votes, in particular those from Midwest coal and manufacturing states. 

Full Text 
President Obama's undeniable success in passing liberal legislation hasn't translated into greater popularity for himself or the Democratic Congress. So perhaps he'll get a bump in the polls now that he's suffered his first setback on one of his signature promises. 
We refer to the failure of cap and tax, which Mr. Obama once modestly promised would signal "the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid gave the plan, if not the planet, up for dead this month, and last week he unveiled a new energy bill whose major provisions include a Cash for Clunkers replay for home appliances and a $5.8 billion subsidy for natural gas vehicles. 
In other words, the green lobby has suffered a landmark defeat, and the recriminations in the liberal press are remarkable. Either Mr. Obama didn't sell it well enough, perfidious Big Business intervened (never mind that many CEOs were supporters), the obtuse middle class won't sacrifice for the global good, or evil Republicans . . . Everyone is to blame but the policy itself. 
In fact, the bill went down for lack of Democratic votes, in particular those from Midwest coal and manufacturing states. Voters in those states have figured out that cap and tax is a redistributionist exercise from the carbon-dependent heartland to the richer coasts. A Democrat -- Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia -- is also leading the charge to repeal the EPA's climate "endangerment" regulation that imposes cap and trade though the backdoor. 
The American Council for Capital Formation released a study on Senator John Kerry's "compromise" climate plan -- which the greens castigated as too modest -- that showed cumulative GDP losses of $2.1 trillion through 2030 and consumer electricity price increases up to 42%. 
Environmentalists didn't even get consolation prizes like a "renewable portfolio standard," the mandate for utilities to generate a set percentage of their electricity from wind, solar and other marginal sources that was supposed to be their cap-and-tax fallback. The new oil and gas taxes that Mr. Obama endorsed in January, which would have run as high as $60 billion, didn't make Mr. Reid's cut either. 
Left as collateral damage are House Democrats who Nancy Pelosi forced to walk point last year on a promise that the Senate would also take up the bill. Mrs. Pelosi has no regrets, last week calling that vote "one of our proudest boasts." The Blue Dog Democrats who voted for it will now deny paternity as they try to save their seats. 
As for the Senate, Mr. Reid's new nonclimate energy bill is all about trying to link Republicans to Big Oil. With BP as the corporate villain, Democrats are proposing to lift the $75 million oil spill liability cap for economic damages to infinity. And to do so retroactively on all rig leases. 
This is a bad-faith exercise. Mr. Reid knows that Democrats like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana have criticized Democratic proposals to set even a $10 billion cap, while Senate Republicans have proposed giving regulators the power to raise the cap based on specific circumstances. Mr. Reid's proposal is designed to throw a bouquet to the trial bar and undermine any grounds for compromise so Democrats can have an election issue. 
The main effect, if it passed, would be to push the small- and mid-sized producers that account for most domestic drilling out of the Gulf, regardless of their safety records. Only the supermajors would be able to afford insurance under the unlimited liability regime. 
A study by the consultant IHS Global Insight found that the vacuum of independent players would result in some 289,000 lost jobs in the Gulf states by 2015 and "significantly shrink offshore oil and gas activity, reduce the dynamism of the industry, and dilute U.S. technological and industry leadership." 
Another Reid inspiration is a break-up of the Minerals Management Service. (The agency was recently renamed by the White House, like rebranding Philip Morris as Altria.) Liberals have always hated an agency that encourages energy production, not that another round of bureaucratic musical chairs will prevent the next blowout. In addition to ensuring higher energy costs and more green-tape delays, the reorganization will ensure that no one in government is accountable when the next leak does occur. 
Whatever one thinks of the science of climate change, cap and tax is the wrong policy response. At enormous economic cost, it would do little to reduce global carbon emissions. To the extent that it reduces growth, it would make the world less able to cope with the consequences if temperatures do rise. The richer the world, the more resources the world will have to adapt and ameliorate bad effects. 
Meantime, the failure of cap and tax removes one more threat to the still-mediocre economic recovery. With more such failures, Mr. Obama's approval rating might start rising too.

Full Text 
CANBERRA -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard reaffirmed her center-left Labor government's commitment to curbing greenhouse-gas emissions, unveiling some interim green measures before a carbon cap-and-trade program is in place. 
"Climate change is real and it is caused to a significant extent by human activity," Ms. Gillard said in a speech in Brisbane. 
Her predecessor, Kevin Rudd, who was ousted in a Labor Party mutiny on June 24, angered progressive voters in April when he shelved plans for a carbon emissions trading scheme until at least the end of the current Kyoto Protocol period in 2012. 
The scheme met an impasse in the upper-house Senate, where it was opposed by conservatives as too tough on industry and the environmentalist Greens as too lenient. 
Australia uses fossil fuels, chiefly coal, for around 90% of its electricity generation, making it one of the biggest per capita polluters in the developed world. 
Ms. Gillard is seeking to re-establish the ruling Labor Party's green credentials ahead of a general election due Aug. 21. 
Tony Abbott, leader of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition of center-right parties, described Labor's latest tactics as "camouflage for the coming carbon tax." 
Ms. Gillard announced Friday that, if she is re-elected in August, Labor will offer companies an incentive to cut their emissions before then, rewarding any early efforts by requiring them to purchase fewer carbon permits in any future carbon-trading market. And the baseline for any emission-reduction efforts will be the same starting point as in the government's proposed carbon pollution-reduction plan.

Abstract 
Advocates of the cap-and-trade approach say that making it more expensive to burn coal or oil would encourage investments in new technology that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption, resulting in lower energy costs overall and avoiding the potential long-term toll of climate disruptions on the economy. 

Full Text 
Senate Democratic leaders Thursday shelved their effort to cap greenhouse-gas emissions as part of a broad energy bill, putting aside indefinitely a centerpiece of President Barack Obama's ambitious effort to transform the way Americans produce and consume energy. 
The proposal would have allowed utilities to trade permits to pollute as they worked to shift away from coal -- a concept commonly called "cap and trade." 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that neither he nor the White House had managed to line up 60 senators to support even a limited proposal seeking to cap carbon-dioxide emissions from electric power companies. 
Mr. Reid refused to declare the idea dead. But Thursday's decision called into question when or whether any legislated cap on greenhouse-gas emissions would reach Mr. Obama's desk. 
Now, businesses, such as wind-turbine makers, that had bet on a greenhouse-gas provision to make alternatives to coal and oil more cost-competitive must recalculate how long it might take for that to happen. 
But industries that opposed congressional action to limit greenhouse-gas emissions still have to reckon with uncertainty over how far the administration may push an effort to do the same thing via the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Advocates of the cap-and-trade approach say that making it more expensive to burn coal or oil would encourage investments in new technology that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption, resulting in lower energy costs overall and avoiding the potential long-term toll of climate disruptions on the economy. Some also argue putting a price on carbon can ahelp reduce reliance on foreign oil. Opponents of such legislation dispute this. 
Opponents say compelling utilities to pay for emitting carbon dioxide would force them to pass along those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. Republicans branded a House bill that proposed an economy-wide system for capping carbon dioxide emissions a "job-killing energy tax." 
Senate Republicans closed ranks in opposition to even limited use of such mechanisms as the clock ticks down to the November elections. 
But a limited cap-and-trade proposal backed by Mr. Reid and the White House also failed to win over a cadre of conservative Democrats from industrial and coal states, who opposed the idea of imposing caps and higher costs on the use of coal and other fossil fuels. 
Some also worried that the measure would put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage to rivals in China, now the No. 1 consumer of energy according to the International Energy Agency. 
China's role in the U.S. debate over climate change cuts both ways. Opponents of capping emissions say enacting such policies would put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to China, which has refused to cap its emissions. Advocates of capping emissions say that unless the U.S. puts a price on carbon, it will lose out to China in the race to develop the energy technologies -- and jobs -- of the 21st century. 
Mr. Reid said Democrats will push for more limited energy legislation, aimed at holding BP PLC accountable for the oil spill, providing incentives to the production and purchase of natural-gas vehicles and funding land and water conservation. 
The Senate's inaction leaves Mr. Obama's Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lisa Jackson, in charge of setting federal limits on greenhouse gases. Ms. Jackson has already adopted rules limiting emissions from cars and requiring state regulators to account for such emissions when they issue air-quality permits to large refineries and manufacturing facilities. 
The agency's authority to do so is under assault. Business groups have sued, challenging the legality of EPA proposals to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. And a group of Democrats is pushing legislation to bar the agency for two years from regulating emissions from stationary sources. 
Utilities now will be forced to make long-term decisions without knowing how carbon dioxide will be treated, said Mike Morris, chief executive of American Electric Power, Columbus, Ohio. 
He said that for the next few years, utilities likely would build gas-fired power plants, which have about half the carbon emissions of plants burning coal. But the cost of nuclear energy will be relatively more costly without a penalty on fossil-fuel use. 
Uncertainty over the future price of carbon and what sorts of technology the EPA will require already is having a "chilling effect" on investment in the steel industry, said Thomas Gibson, a former EPA official who now heads the American Iron and Steel Institute. 
But other business could be chilled if Washington abandons entirely the idea of raising the price of consuming fossil fuels. Companies trying to develop and sell solar and wind energy technology, energy-conservation systems or electric vehicles have hoped that caps on greenhouse gas emissions would jump-start demand. 
These companies will now focus on certain states that have their own clean-energy mandates, such as California, Colorado and New Jersey, said Angiolo Laviziano, chief executive officer of REC Solar Inc., a provider of solar systems in San Luis Obispo, Calif. 
Still, the solar industry is growing at the rate of about 40% a year in terms of electrical power installed and is likely to continue to grow, said Ron Kenedi, vice president of Sharp Corp.'s Sharp Solar Energy Solutions Group in Huntington Beach, Calif. 
Mr. Reid's decision to pull cap-and-trade from the energy bill could reverberate on Wall Street, where banks and brokerage firms had been anticipating climate legislation that would lead to widespread trading of carbon "credits." 
There is already a global carbon-trading market, with the majority of the trading taking place in the regulated European markets. It amounted to $127 billion last year. 
It isn't clear how many of the provisions Mr. Reid is promising to include in the narrower energy bill will survive a Senate floor debate.

Abstract 
China's growing energy demands will present new challenges to U.S. foreign policy, as well as to international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change. 

Full Text 
China has passed the U.S. to become the world's biggest energy consumer, according to new data from the International Energy Agency, a milestone that reflects both China's decades-long burst of economic growth and its rapidly expanding clout as an industrial giant. 
China's ascent marks "a new age in the history of energy," IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said in an interview. The country's surging appetite has transformed global energy markets and propped up prices of oil and coal in recent years, and its continued growth stands to have long-term implications for U.S. energy security. 
The Paris-based IEA, energy adviser to most of the world's biggest economies, said China consumed 2.252 billion tons of oil equivalent last year, about 4% more than the U.S., which burned through 2.170 billion tons of oil equivalent. The oil-equivalent metric represents all forms of energy consumed, including crude oil, nuclear power, coal, natural gas and renewable sources such as hydropower. 
China, meanwhile, disputed the IEA figures, but didn't offer alternative data, according to Zhou Xian, spokesperson for China's top energy agency. 
The U.S. had been the globe's biggest overall energy user since the early 1900s, Mr. Birol said. 
China overtook it at breakneck pace. China's total energy consumption was just half that of the U.S. 10 years ago, but in many of the years since, China saw annual double-digit growth rates. It had been expected to pass the U.S. about five years from now, but took the top position earlier because the global recession hit the U.S. more severely, slowing American industrial activity and energy use. 
China's economic rise has required enormous amounts of energy -- especially since much of the past decade's growth was fueled not by consumer demand, as in the U.S., but from energy-intense heavy industry and infrastructure building. 
China's growing energy demands will present new challenges to U.S. foreign policy, as well as to international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change. China National Petroleum Co., the country's biggest oil company, is pushing forward with oil and gas projects in Iran, despite U.S. efforts to enforce sanctions against the Tehran government. 
Beijing has refused to agree to cap its overall growth in its consumption of fossil fuels, or reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. That frustrated President Barack Obama's efforts to forge an international climate agreement at a United Nations summit in Copenhagen last December. 
China instead set a target to reduce emissions intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of gross domestic product -- by 40% to 45% from 2005 levels by 2020. That meant China was agreeing to make its economy more energy efficient -- boosting its competitiveness -- but not to consume less energy overall. 
China's growth has transformed global energy markets and sustained higher prices for everything from oil to uranium and other natural resources that the country has been consuming. Once, China was a major exporter of both oil and coal. Its increasing reliance on imports has sustained higher energy prices world-wide and underpinned a natural-resource boom in Africa, the Middle East and Australia. 
"There is little doubt that China's growing consumption changes what ability we have to control our own destiny within global energy markets," said David Pumphrey, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "China can now demand a large space inside any energy-policy tent." 
China's rapidly expanding need for energy promises to have major geopolitical implications as it hunts for ways to satisfy its needs. Already, China's rising imports have changed global geopolitics. Chinese oil and coal companies have been looking overseas in their quest to secure energy supplies, pitching the Chinese flag in places like Sudan, which Western companies had largely abandoned under international pressure. 
The most ambitious effort to secure overseas energy supplies was the failed 2005 attempt Cnooc Ltd. to take over California-based Unocal in an $18 billion bid, which was trumped by politics and rival Chevron. Despite a short pullback in the aftermath of that failed deal, Chinese companies have expanded overseas with purchases in Central Asia, Africa, South America, Canada and even small stakes in the Gulf of Mexico with funding from China's state-owned banks. 
Voracious energy demand also helps explain why China -- which gets most of its electricity from coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels -- passed the U.S. in 2007 as the world's largest emitter of carbon-dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases. 
In the past, being the world's biggest consumer of fossil fuels went hand in hand with being its dominant economy. The question now is whether this will hold true in the future, as nations compete to develop new ways to produce more wealth with less energy. While China is No. 1 in consumption, the U.S. remains the world's biggest economy. 
The U.S. is also by far the biggest per-capita energy consumer, with the average American burning five times as much energy annually as the average Chinese citizen, said Mr. Birol. 
The U.S. also remains the biggest oil consumer by a wide margin, going through roughly 19 million barrels a day on average. China, at about 9.2 million barrels a day, runs second. But many oil analysts believe U.S. crude demand has peaked or is unlikely to grow much in coming years, because of improved energy efficiency and more stringent vehicle fuel-efficiency regulations. 
China's rise is also helping shift the focus for producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Key OPEC states like Saudi Arabia long looked to U.S. oil consumption for guidance in adding new pumping capacity. But in recent years, OPEC states have built or started building refineries and storage facilities in Asia. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, now ships more to China than to the U.S. 
The decreased "energy intensity" of the U.S. economy is a key reason energy investors, such as General Electric, have increasingly looked to China. Mr. Birol said China requires total energy investments of some $4 trillion over the next 20 years to keep feeding its economy and avoid power blackouts and fuel shortages. 
Mr. Birol, formerly an economist at OPEC, said China is expected to build some 1,000 gigawatts of new power-generation capacity over the next 15 years. That is about equal to the current total electricity-generation capacity in the U.S. -- a level achieved over several decades of construction. 
China's energy intensity actually fell during the first phase of its economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s, which was driven by light manufacturing. But in the early 1990s, China became a net oil importer for the first time as its demand finally outpaced domestic supplies. China's energy demand surged again after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. 
Before China joined the WTO, most international prognosticators, including the IEA, predicted energy demand would increase at an annual rate of 3% to 4% from 2000 to 2010. Demand wound up growing four times faster than they predicted. Growth in China's energy appetite could slow as industrial expansion cools and energy-efficiency policies take hold.

Abstract 
[...] another poll taken over the weekend suggested the opposition may be gaining ground, as Labor continues to struggle with political baggage that includes a proposed tax on the resource industry, a retreat on climate-change legislation and the issue of a recent surge in asylum seekers from other countries. 

Full Text 
Conflicting polls over the weekend raised questions over whether next month's Australian parliamentary elections will be an easy win for the ruling Labor Party. 
Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Saturday set an Aug. 21 election date as she seeks to take advantage of a rebound in the party's popularity following the ouster in June of her predecessor, Kevin Rudd. 
A Newspoll survey, published in The Australian daily newspaper Monday, shows Labor has opened up a 10-point lead over the coalition -- indicating an easy win with an increased majority if repeated on Election Day. The Australian is owned by News Corp., which also owns The Wall Street Journal. The widely watched poll of 1,140 voters was conducted over the weekend, spanning the period after Ms. Gillard announced the election date early Saturday. 
On a straight match-up, or primary-vote basis -- which counts only voters' first preferences and doesn't include votes redirected from smaller parties and independent candidates -- Labor's rating was 42% versus the opposition's 38%, Newspoll said. It is the first time Labor has been ahead on a straight match-up since April. 
Ms. Gillard also holds an edge in popularity over opposition leader Tony Abbott, despite having taken office less than a month ago. The poll showed respondents preferred Ms. Gillard as prime minister over Mr. Abbott by 50% to 32%. 
But another poll taken over the weekend suggested the opposition may be gaining ground, as Labor continues to struggle with political baggage that includes a proposed tax on the resource industry, a retreat on climate-change legislation and the issue of a recent surge in asylum seekers from other countries. 
That poll, conducted by Galaxy Research for Australia's Nine television network showed Ms. Gillard's Labor party and the rival Liberal-National Coalition each with 50% when including all the votes the parties would win under Australia's preferred-voting system. 
Earlier Sunday, Ms. Gillard described the campaign as being "on a knife's edge," while Mr. Abbott told SBS television: "This is a winnable election, but we are in a position from which we can improve." 
Labor currently has a 16-seat majority in the 150-seat lower House of Representatives. The Liberal-National coalition may need to win as many as 17 seats to take office, based on electoral boundaries redrawn since the 2007 election. 
Ms. Gillard kicked off her campaign holding babies in Brisbane, Queensland, and during an address at a public-policy think tank stressed issues facing ordinary Australians, such as long waiting times for health services and overcrowded public transport. Mr. Abbott visited a home in Western Sydney where, over tea and scones, he discussed similar issues. 
The Labor Party has moved to neutralize issues where the conservative Liberal-National coalition enjoys an advantage among voters, moving toward more populist stances on issues such as immigration and population growth. 
Ms. Gillard said her top priority on becoming prime minister was to end the fight over plans for a 40% tax on "super profits" in the resources sector. The issue hurt the popularity of Mr. Rudd before he stepped down, as the industry criticized the proposal as damaging the economics of doing business in Australia. She quickly cut a deal with miners reducing the tax rate to 30% and limiting it to coal and iron ore, rather than all minerals. Mr. Abbott is determined to keep the issue on the agenda, warning that the tax will penalize one of Australia's strongest export sectors, and vowing to scrap it if he wins power.

Abstract 
Minutes after Mr. Goodwin is sworn in as a senator Tuesday, he "will make the 60th vote" needed to ensure passage of a bill to extend unemployment benefits, said Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.). 

Full Text 
West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin named a political ally Friday to temporarily succeed the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, clearing the way for Mr. Manchin to seek the seat in a special election. 
Carte Goodwin, a 36-year-old Charleston attorney and Mr. Manchin's former general counsel, will hold the Senate seat until a special election expected in November. Mr. Manchin is likely to be a candidate in that race; Mr. Goodwin said he won't run. Both are Democrats. 
State lawmakers were meeting Friday to set the process for the election. The term of Mr. Byrd, who died last month at age 92 after more than 50 years in the Senate, expires in 2012. 
"I'm truly confident that Carte Goodwin will look out for West Virginia and will do us proud," said Mr. Manchin on Friday at the state capitol in Charleston. He praised Mr. Goodwin for helping draft state mine-safety laws in 2006 after several deadly coal-mining accidents. 
Minutes after Mr. Goodwin is sworn in as a senator Tuesday, he "will make the 60th vote" needed to ensure passage of a bill to extend unemployment benefits, said Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.). The bill has been stalled since Mr. Byrd's death. Republicans and one Democrat, Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, have opposed the bill because it would add to the deficit. 
An energy bill that could include a cap on carbon emissions from power plants could also come up in the Senate before the August recess. Mr. Goodwin said he wouldn't support such a proposal or broader climate-change legislation. 
"They simply are not right for West Virginia," he said. "I will not support any piece of legislation that threatens in any way West Virginia jobs or any West Virginia family." 
Mr. Goodwin comes from a prominent and politically active family in the state. His late father was chairman of West Virginia University's board of governors. His wife is state director for Mr. Rockefeller. 
State GOP leaders said Mr. Manchin's decision to tap someone from his inner circle showed why the state needed to hold the election quickly. 
Republicans say they won't cede the seat to Mr. Manchin. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) is viewed as the strongest potential GOP candidate. A campaign spokesman said she wouldn't decide about running until election details were set.

Changes Choke Cap-and-Trade Market

Abstract 
The collapse in the pioneering market where power producers trade permits that allow them to emit sulfur dioxide and other pollutants that cause acid rain comes as policy makers seek to establish a similar market to curb the emissions of carbon, a cause of climate change. [...] in 2008, in response to lawsuits filed by a handful of utilities and North Carolina, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the EPA had overstepped its authority in expanding the markets and that parts of the new rules conflicted with existing Clean Air Act regulations.

The original U.S. cap-and-trade market, which succeeded in slashing the power-plant emissions that cause acid rain, is in disarray following the issuance of new federal pollution rules. 
The collapse in the pioneering market where power producers trade permits that allow them to emit sulfur dioxide and other pollutants that cause acid rain comes as policy makers seek to establish a similar market to curb the emissions of carbon, a cause of climate change. 
The acid-rain market has struggled for the past two years as utilities, states and investors waited for the Environmental Protection Agency to issue new rules. The rules, released last week, put tougher limits on emissions by power plants but rely less on trading. As a result, the allowances that utilities now trade to allow them to emit sulfur dioxide are expected to become worthless. 
"It is tragic," says Gary Hart, an analyst at ICAP Energy LLC based in Birmingham, Ala., who has worked on environmental markets for two decades. "It is something that worked so well." 
The U.S. acid-rain trading program is often cited as the first, large-scale effort by a country to combine environmental goals with a market system. Starting in 1995, the U.S. government put a limit on sulfur-dioxide emissions -- essentially the "cap" in cap and trade. That limit affects mostly coal-fired power plants. 
Then officials created a market by handing out a set number of emission allowances to utilities. Plants surrendered one allowance for each ton of sulfur dioxide they emitted into the atmosphere. If utilities cut emissions by switching to low-sulfur coals, increasing efficiency or adding emission-control technology, they could sell their extra allowances or reduce the number of allowances they needed to buy. 
The acid-rain market has been considered a success, helping to reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by half. Permits to emit sulfur had once traded for $1,600 a ton. European carbon markets followed, and the Obama administration has said it supports the notion of caps on carbon emissions. 
The market's collapse shows how vulnerable market-based approaches to reducing air pollution are to government actions. That could scare off investors, who won't commit to a market where the rules can change at any minute. 
The current problems in the acid-rain market stem from 2005, when the EPA, with the backing of many utilities and environmental groups, announced major new reductions in smog-forming and soot-producing emissions, and expanded the reach of the cap-and-trade system in more than two dozen, mostly Eastern, states. 
But in 2008, in response to lawsuits filed by a handful of utilities and North Carolina, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the EPA had overstepped its authority in expanding the markets and that parts of the new rules conflicted with existing Clean Air Act regulations. The court allowed the expansion of the market to take place, but it ordered the EPA to rewrite its rules to comply with existing law. Prices of allowances fell in response, and trading dwindled. 
In response to the ruling, prices for the pollution allowances plunged to $130 a ton. Utilities held off on projects to clean up their plants. 
Last week, the EPA issued new rules to comply with the court's decision. The new program will limit the use of the market and instead require most of the emission reductions to come from changes at the plants themselves. And millions of allowances that utilities now hold can't be used under the new program, which will issue its own allowances. 
The EPA, which says its hands were tied by the court ruling, says changes aren't a signal that the EPA has soured on market-based programs to combat pollution. 
The acid-rain market isn't likely to recover from the new rules, people involved in the market say. Requiring utilities to take new steps to cut sulfur-dioxide emissions will cause an already large surplus of allowances to balloon further. 
"It really feels like prices are going to zero quickly," says Peter Zaborowsky, a managing director of Evolution Markets Inc., a White Plains, N.Y.-based provider of environmental brokerage services for utilities and investors. Allowances traded at times at less than $3 last week. 
U.S. Sen. Thomas Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, has proposed new legislation that could revive the markets, but the bill faces a Congress focused on broader energy legislation. 
Many utilities and environmental groups generally haven't lost faith in a market-based approach to the problem of air pollution. John Walke, clean-air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that the 2008 appeals-court decision remained silent on the larger question of the effectiveness of environmental markets, and that the new EPA rules shouldn't be viewed as an abandonment of cap-and-trade. 
"The acid-rain market continues to be relevant to the debate over CO2 because it is a successful model," he says.

Thanks to the Journal for shining light on "The Bucyrus Travesty" (Review & Outlook, June 30). Denying Bucyrus International Inc. a loan guarantee is yet another act of economic suicide by misguided zealots -- both political and environmental. Obama-appointed Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg should travel to Wisconsin with President Obama and personally face the Bucyrus workers and explain what he has just done. That might give Mr. Hochberg pause. How can he look at himself in the mirror or with a straight face explain that he has doomed $600 million of business and 1,000 U.S. jobs because the deal with India's Reliance may have an "adverse environmental impact" in India? The deal was killed even though India is already building the plant, will mine the coal, and will award the business to one of our international competitors. This is dumb. 
Then the bank put salt in the wound by approving $528 million in low-cost loans to Fisker Automotive in Vice President Joe Biden's hometown to build electric cars selling for $48,000, and that's before the taxpayer is taken for a $7,500 tax credit. I couldn't lie awake at night dreaming up this kind of nightmare economic scenario. 
Chris J. Krisinger 
Burke, Va. 
I am a production manager at one of the supply chain companies for Bucyrus. We are located in the Atlanta area, so the impact on jobs reaches far beyond the Midwest. The Reliance-Bucyrus deal would have been a big boost to our business as a steel service center. Meanwhile, my employees sweep the floor wondering when the next layoff is coming. If Bucyrus was in the auto business with the United Auto Workers, the Obama administration would be falling over itself to approve this deal with the Indians. 
Jim Hayes 
Canton, Ga. 
This is another excellent example of the administration just not getting it and confusing priorities. I am a former Obama supporter. 
Ted Wolf

You highlight the hypocrisy that often accompanies government subsidies. However, it also indicates the inability of some national administrations to balance climate change and legitimate development objectives. 
With 412 million people without access to electricity -- 34% of its population -- India needs all the electricity it can get. However, this is clearly irrelevant to the Export-Import Bank, which seems to only have regard for the political incorrectness of associating itself with a coal project; never mind that coal supplies around 50% of America's own electricity. 
The decision will not stop the project. The need for electricity in India is too great. The decision therefore will do nothing to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases, or even allow U.S. companies the opportunity to export technologies to help reduce emissions, but merely provide those making it with a sort of mindless warm inner glow.

I presume President Obama has also placed a moratorium on further Export-Import Bank funding of equipment for the deep water drilling project for Petrobas in Brazil 
announced last year. I think the president misspoke when he talked of a "laser like" focus on jobs. He forgot the word "killing." 
Stan Flueso 
Coplay, Pa. 

The article quotes Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg that he was supporting the president's policy to "transition away from high-carbon investments." The implication of this is that American jobs in an industry where the U.S. is the world leader are to be sacrificed for an ideology. 
If the Obama administration is serious about doubling U.S. exports, it needs to be willing to encourage the export of surface coal-mining equipment to an industry in Asia which is among the fastest growing in the world. 
Despite all of the attention devoted to solar and wind, the global coal industry is undergoing its greatest expansion in history. In the recession year 2009, while global natural gas and oil use declined, coal's share of world energy consumption reached 29.4%, the highest since 1970. China's coal consumption in 2009 increased 9.6%, India's 6.8%, and South Korea's 4.1%. The total increase in consumption of coal in China in one year was approximately equivalent to the entire coal use for electric generation in Europe. This is the scale of the dynamic growth market that global-warming ideologues are prepared to walk away from. 
One should not wonder that American industry is investing in new manufacturing capacity overseas.

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The White House's top energy adviser acknowledged that smaller oil firms might no longer be able to drill in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of legislation moving through Congress that would eliminate the cap on their liability for oil spills. 
"Maybe this is a sector where you really need large companies who can bring to bear the expertise and who have the wherewithal to cover the expense if something goes wrong," Carol Browner, special adviser to President Barack Obama on energy and climate change, said in an interview. Eliminating the $75 million cap on liability for oil spills "will mean that you only have large companies in this sector," she said. 
On other topics, Ms. Browner said the Obama administration would be happy with a scaled-back energy bill this year "just to get started." She said the administration is mindful of the effects of a deepwater-drilling moratorium and wants "to get people back to work," but wants first to understand what caused the BP PLC oil spill. 
The administration has imposed a now-challenged moratorium on deepwater drilling while a presidential commission conducts an investigation of the BP disaster. Oil companies have been pushing the Interior Department to lift the moratorium, saying that new safety regulations could allow drilling to resume. 
"The small companies did nothing wrong -- and you're going to shut them down?" said Robert Dillon, a spokesman for Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R, Alaska.) "So the only thing you are going to have left are the big, national oil companies like China. Where are the free-market values in that?" 
Ms. Browner said lifting the moratorium would depend on developing better spill-response plans and an understanding of the cause of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. "We're keenly aware of the impact of the moratorium," she said. 
Discarding the liability cap is a potent issue on Capitol Hill as oil continues to leak into the Gulf. Small companies have warned that discarding limits would shut out all but the biggest companies from offshore drilling, partly because obtaining insurance would become impossible without liability limits. 
BP has paid out more than $132 million in damage claims and has promised to honor all legitimate claims despite the statutory liability cap. Under pressure from the White House, the company also has promised to put $20 billion into a fund to compensate residents for economic losses. 
"There are still other damages to come -- for example, natural-resource damages that BP will ultimately have to pay," Ms. Browner said. 
Senate Democratic leaders are planning to use a broader energy package as a vehicle to discard the liability cap. The package has stalled in the face of opposition from coal and manufacturing states to mandatory reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions.

Abstract 
Some Democratic senators who attended a bipartisan White House meeting Mr. Obama convened to find a consensus on energy policy said there appeared to be support for a proposal to cap greenhouse-gas emissions from electric power utilities only. 

Full Text 
President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies signaled Tuesday that they were ready to shelve their effort to win an economy-wide cap on carbon emissions and work for a more limited bill. 
Some Democratic senators who attended a bipartisan White House meeting Mr. Obama convened to find a consensus on energy policy said there appeared to be support for a proposal to cap greenhouse-gas emissions from electric power utilities only. 
Most Republicans and some Democrats remain opposed to even that. But Republicans who attended the session said they could support more limited proposals to promote energy efficiency and renewable-energy technology. 
The Senate appears poised to act on legislation that would encompass many of these ideas, in addition to measures aimed at responding directly to the Gulf oil spill. But after the meeting, there was still no plan for how to move forward, even though Democrats hope to have legislation on the Senate floor in weeks. 
Immediately after the energy session, Mr. Obama followed in the footsteps of U.S. presidents since Franklin Roosevelt and stood with the Saudi Arabian king to praise the bonds between the two nations -- bonds anchored in U.S. consumption of Saudi oil. 
The juxtaposition of the events highlights the challenges facing Mr. Obama and Senate Democratic leaders as they try to use the oil spill to generate momentum for efforts to curb U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. 
Mr. Obama told senators Tuesday that he wanted Congress to act on a bill that would raise the cost of burning oil and coal, to help make alternatives more competitive. The White House said Mr. Obama "is confident that we will be able to get something done this year." But it was clear that the most ambitious plan is off the table. 
Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.) and John Kerry (D., Mass.), who have proposed a bill that would put a broad cap on emissions from fossil fuels, said after the White House meeting that they were prepared to scale back their proposal. 
"All of us have to compromise," Mr. Kerry said. One idea is to limit the cap on carbon emissions to electric utilities, he said. That would exclude the manufacturing and transportation sectors. 
After the meeting, Sen. Olympia Snowe (R., Maine) endorsed a power-sector cap. She said utilities needed certainty about the price of burning fossil fuels to make long-term investments, and had "the most to lose" if Congress left carbon regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
But other Republican attendees said they continued to oppose what they called a "national energy tax" -- the GOP label for the Democrats' cap-and-trade proposal. Several Republicans said they supported more limited action to prod utilities into using more renewable energy, such as wind power. 
"As long as we take a national energy tax off the table, there's no reason we can't have clean-energy legislation," said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.). The sides discussed ideas they agree on, such as the need to boost the number of electric cars and increase nuclear power, he said. 
Some Democrats who attended the White House meeting also expressed doubts about prospects for any bill that raises fossil-fuel costs. 
Sen. Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said that the only proposal that was likely to command sufficient support in both parties was legislation already approved in a Senate committee that would mandate greater use of renewable energy by electric utilities and set efficiency standards for buildings. 
The coming weeks could bring a flurry of activity on energy and oil-drilling issues that respond to the Gulf spill. On Wednesday, congressional panels are expected to approve legislation that would eliminate the cap on oil companies' liability for spills, and tighten environmental and safety requirements for offshore drilling. The bills' prospects for passage remain murky, amid divisions over the bills' contents and whether they should be incorporated into legislation aimed at tackling climate change.

Abstract 
Driving Mr. Rudd's reversal have been a decision to shelve a proposed carbon cap-and-trade system meant to fight climate change and a planned tax on "super profits" by Australia's mining companies -- a critical industry for the resource-rich country. The tax, which the government thought would win popular support by spreading the wealth from the booming mining sector, has instead backfired as the public worries it will damage Australia's credibility as an investment destination. 

Full Text 
CANBERRA -- Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stepped down on Thursday, amid a mutiny in the once-popular leader's governing party, clearing the way for the country's first female prime minister. 
Mr. Rudd resigned before a leadership ballot could be held, after Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard, a Welsh-born 48-year-old former trial lawyer, challenged him for the top spot in the governing center-left Labor Party -- a post that carries with it the premiership. Ms. Gillard stood unopposed in Thursday's vote of Labor's 112 lawmakers. Her candidacy was backed by Labor's right wing, but also by key unions on the left. 
Her challenge marks an unprecedented fall for the man who ended nearly 12 years of conservative government in Australia. Mr. Rudd swept to power in November 2007, ousting the long-ruling Liberal-National coalition of center-right parties. His popularity slid in recent months after a series of policy missteps. 
The party feared that Mr. Rudd, a 52-year-old Chinese-speaking former diplomat, would lead them to defeat in national elections that could come as soon as August. 
"In Australian politics, it is almost unprecedented that a first-term prime minister is dumped by his own party," said Roland Randall, a strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. But he said in a note to investors that "for markets, this should not be a destabilizing event," because Mr. Rudd and Ms. Gillard aren't far apart on policy. 
Driving Mr. Rudd's reversal have been a decision to shelve a proposed carbon cap-and-trade system meant to fight climate change and a planned tax on "super profits" by Australia's mining companies -- a critical industry for the resource-rich country. 
The tax, which the government thought would win popular support by spreading the wealth from the booming mining sector, has instead backfired as the public worries it will damage Australia's credibility as an investment destination. Mining giants BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Ltd. warned billions of dollars of investment are at risk, and they have led a fight against the 40% levy, saying it would make Australia one of the highest-taxed jurisdictions in the world. 
This criticism has resonated with many Australians who own shares in mining companies, often through pension funds. 
Mining, a top export sector, helped Australia sidestep the global recession, thanks to demand from developing countries like China and India for the country's iron ore and coal. 
Unlike Mr. Rudd, said Mr. Randall, the strategist, Ms. "Gillard has not been steadfastly inflexible in her position and would not look weak if she chooses to compromise on the tax." 
The Australian dollar rose on against the U.S. currency on the news of her election, and Australian stocks gained, led by mining companies, on hopes that Ms. Gillard would soften the tax. The S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.6% in Thursday morning trading. 
"As you would expect after Rudd's departure, resources stocks are outperforming . . . it's giving people some hope that the resources super profits tax will be altered," said Chris Blair, a senior private client adviser at brokerage Patersons. 
Still, Wednesday's political uprising came as a shock. As recently as Monday, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner said talk of Ms. Gillard taking on Mr. Rudd was "complete nonsense." Just hours before Mr. Rudd's news conference on Wednesday night, key Labor figures were denying that any challenge was afoot. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Rudd sought to portray himself as above party squabbles. "I was not elected by the factional leaders of the Australian Labor Party to do a job -- though they may be seeking to do a job on me," he said. He emphasized his stewardship during the financial crisis, which Australia shrugged off with only a brief slowdown. 
Mr. Rudd's plight would have been unthinkable a year ago, when his approval rating was well above 60%. A poll earlier this week found Labor eking out a 52% to 48% edge against the Liberal-National bloc, calculated on the basis of Australia's preferential voting system. 
Critics said Mr. Rudd has squandered the political goodwill awarded to him for bringing Labor in from the political wilderness with a landslide victory. The career bureaucrat's aloof demeanor and tendency to immerse himself in policy has drawn parallels with President Barack Obama, with whom he struck up an early friendship. 
Mr. Rudd's tendency to announce rather than consult with the party on policy also irked some. It may have made it easier for his detractors to level blame and ultimately undermine him. 
Ms. Gillard, elected to Parliament in 1998, has risen swiftly through the Labor ranks and held the key portfolios of education, employment and workplace relations. 
She has shown sharp political elbows in the past. When a political opponent said in 2007 that the unmarried lawmaker wasn't qualified to lead the country because she had chosen not to have children, Ms. Gillard shot back that her accuser was "a man of the past, with very old-fashioned views."

Abstract 
Liberal commentator Rachel Maddow, disappointed with the White House's response to the oil spill, dubbed herself the "fake president" on her Wednesday MSNBC show, sat before an Oval Office backdrop and delivered the address she wished the president had given, pledging a halt to all dangerous drilling and to deliver an energy bill to eventually end U.S. consumption of oil. 

Full Text 
President Barack Obama's political response to the Gulf oil spill has exposed long-simmering tensions on the left over climate-change legislation, as well as rifts on oil drilling. 
The conflict came into view this week in the aftermath of Mr. Obama's Oval Office address on the spill, when environmentalists, bloggers and even sympathetic commentators accused Mr. Obama of failing to lay out a tough legislative response that seized on the public's outrage over the spill. 
Complicating matters, green groups themselves have split over whether to attack or support the White House. 
In his address Tuesday, Mr. Obama pledged to work for a climate bill, but said he was open to ideas from both parties. He pointedly didn't embrace proposals that have strong support on the left to cap carbon emissions and cut down on drilling. That prompted a week-long series of attacks on the president from some of his closest allies. 
"I've been disappointed," said Kyle Ash, legislative director for the activist group Greenpeace. "This really is just a slightly better version of what I would have expected a Republican White House to do if there was a disaster like this in the Gulf." 
A number of liberals also turned their fire on long-established environmental groups that remain closely allied with the administration, including the Sierra Club. The group's executive director, Michael Brune -- prompted by liberal blogger Jane Hamsher, who said the group was playing "an inside game" with the White House -- shot back on the Huffington Post website. He noted how he and his colleagues had mobilized to block expansions of coal mining and oil drilling. 
Still, Mr. Brune conceded that he has seen "reluctance by smart campaigners and organizations to criticize the president, primarily because those people or groups support much of what the administration is trying to do." 
Some liberals are wary of compromise. Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity, a group that has sued the federal government over its drilling policy, said he was miffed that the White House hadn't rescinded its March 31 expansion of drilling plans in the Atlantic Ocean and Alaska. 
"In the midst of this crisis, it indicates the administration is more concerned with angering potential conservative supporters of its climate bill than it is in reining in the abuses that caused the spill," he said. 
Liberal commentator Rachel Maddow, disappointed with the White House's response to the oil spill, dubbed herself the "fake president" on her Wednesday MSNBC show, sat before an Oval Office backdrop and delivered the address she wished the president had given, pledging a halt to all dangerous drilling and to deliver an energy bill to eventually end U.S. consumption of oil. 
The criticism has irked the White House, which has sought to assure some commentators and activists that the president will push for the strongest measure possible. He will meet with a bipartisan group of senators Wednesday to try to get an energy bill on track, including ideas ranging from a broad cap on carbon emissions to a cap only on carbon from electric utilities, said White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. 
"The president's view is for inviting a wide range of people who have ideas," Mr. Emanuel said. Democrats in the Senate are split on the best approach, despite Mr. Obama's call, and what kind of energy bill Congress can pass remains unclear. 
One point of contention between liberals and several major environmental groups concerns a possible Senate bill that would permit additional offshore drilling. Critics on the left have questioned why environmental lobbyists would support such legislation. Officials from several groups said Friday the process was in flux and wouldn't necessarily embrace drilling. The primary goal, they said, was winning caps on carbon emissions. 
Jeremy Symons, senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation, another advocacy group with close ties to the White House, said his group wouldn't hesitate to criticize the party's leaders if the climate bill isn't strong enough. 
"When they do the right thing we will support it, and when they don't, we'll call them on it," he said. 
Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) described tensions on the left as "some differences over details," but said those disagreements "pale in comparison to the total opposition to a clean-energy plan from the Republican side." 
Democrats sought Friday to shower more attention on the GOP uproar that ensued after Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas) apologized to BP PLC during a hearing by referring to the $20 billion victims fund as a "shakedown" by the White House. 
Republican leaders this week denounced Mr. Barton. A spokesman for the GOP's House campaign committee, Ken Spain, waved off the idea that Mr. Barton or the energy issue would affect voters this year, saying Democrats were trying to "distract" from a "culture of incompetence that has resulted in the mismanagement of the federal bureaucracy, the economy, and the ballooning deficit."

Full Text 
Senate Democrats are struggling with how to move forward on energy legislation, despite President Barack Obama's assertion this week that the Gulf oil spill underscores the need to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. 
Some want an ambitious bill that makes using carbon more expensive, in order to discourage its use. Earlier this month Mr. Obama said this was the "only way" to move the nation to a clean-energy economy. 
But Republicans and some Democrats oppose that plan, which would include a system known as "cap and trade" and which passed the House last year. Some call it too taxing for a fragile economy, and Senate leadership aides say there isn't currently sufficient support to move such a plan through the Senate. 
Amid an unsettled legislative landscape, Mr. Obama was noncommittal about what approach to take during his Oval Office address this week. 
That left environmentalists and supporters of a cap-and-trade system worried that they were missing their best chance to reduce U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to exploit the Gulf oil spill. 
On Thursday, Senate Democrats met to hear competing proposals from senators but emerged without a decision on a way forward. They will gather again next week, and key senators will meet Wednesday with Mr. Obama at the White House. Their goal is to bring a bill to the Senate floor in just a few weeks,after senators return from their July 4 break, Senate leadership aides said. 
"We have no one saying no [to an energy bill]; we have everyone saying yes," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) told reporters after the Democrats' hour-long meeting. "I am committed to getting [a bill] to the floor in the next work period." 
Vice President Joe Biden predicted an energy bill would pass this year. "It's going to be difficult. It's going to be hard," he said. "There is a clear possibility we'll get a solid bill." 
If the Senate does pass energy legislation this summer, Democrats plan to spend the fall merging it with the sweeping measure passed last year by the House. They would bring the compromise back to both chambers for a final vote in a lame-duck session after the midterm elections, leadership aides said. 
That is partly because the fall legislative calendar is already tight, and partly to allow vulnerable House Democrats to avoid a vote that could open them to new attacks before the election. 
Whatever emerges from the Senate is expected to include provisions responding directly to the oil spill, such as tougher regulations on the oil industry and higher liability caps. 
The question is how much further the legislation would go to address emissions of heat-trapping gasses linked to climate change and encourage use of renewable fuels. 
The most sweeping approach is backed by Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and Joe Lieberman (I., Conn.), who pitched it to their colleagues Thursday. It would seek to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by penalizing heavy polluting industries. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) outlined her approach, which is aimed at achieving the same goal by focusing on so-called dirty energy producers, such as coal-mining companies and oil refineries. 
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.) spoke about a different proposal to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy. 
Republicans argue that legislation should be limited to items directly tied to the oil spill. "Legislation to respond to this oil spill should be an opportunity for genuine bipartisan cooperation," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the Senate floor this week. 
Some of Mr. Obama's supporters have suggested that Democrats rally behind a compromise that would restrict the emissions cap to electric utilities, leaving out oil refiners, manufacturers and other industries. Environmentalists have been hesitant to embrace this approach, still hoping for a more comprehensive bill. Others worry it would be a stretch to connect a bill that leaves out oil refiners to the Gulf oil spill, which is providing the political momentum for any action at all on an issue that appeared dead just a couple months ago. 
The success of a bill focusing on electric utilities would likely depend on support from those companies. Some favor capping emissions, because it would reward their investments in low-carbon energy and avert more costly regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency. But other companies object to the idea of making only utilities subject to a cap on emissions. 
Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power Co., based in Columbus, Ohio, said capping emissions only from power plants wouldn't lower global concentrations of so-called greenhouse gases. 
"It will simply raise electricity rates in states dependent on electricity generated with fossil fuels without addressing the real issue," she said.

World News: Pollution Is Worsening in China

Abstract 
Energy intensity is closely linked to reducing greenhouse gases because most of China's power comes from burning fossil fuels, like coal, which release carbon. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- Environmental protection authorities in China acknowledged on Thursday that despite tougher measures, pollution is increasing as the country's economy rebounds, 
quashing hopes that China had turned a corner last year when emissions dropped. 
Emissions of acid-rain-causing sulfur dioxide rose 1.2% in the first quarter from a year earlier, as exports and domestic demand picked up and China burned more coal in power 
plants and factories, according to Zhang Lijun, vice minister of the environment. 

It was the first quarterly rise since 2007. 
Mr. Zhang said at a news conference that authorities now are "not very optimistic" on the prospects of emission cuts. 
The news followed announcements last month that China's energy intensity -- a measure of how much fuel is used per dollar of economic output -- has reversed direction and is 

also on the rise. 
China's battle to clean up its badly polluted environment and improve energy efficiency has had a disappointing year. 
Gains made across a wide swath of areas in recent years have been reversed as environmental concerns took a back seat to the economic recovery. 
Critics say some environmental regulations were ignored in China's massive scramble to reboot its economy with economic stimulus. 
Mr. Zhang acknowledged some of those problems. He said that part of the reason for the increased pollution is an increase in energy-intensive projects and a "slack mentality," 

in addition to weak supervision by local environmental authorities. 

The setbacks pose a problem for China's ability to reach its domestic goals of cutting major pollutants, including sulfur dioxide -- one of its key pollutants that is also linked to 
many health problems -- 10% by 2010 from their levels in 2006. 
The reversal also poses a problem for Beijing's international pledge to cut back carbon emissions per dollar of economic output by 40% to 45% by 2020 from 2005 levels. 
China made that promise as part of efforts to gain the upper hand in global climate-change negotiations. 
In May, Chinese Premier Wen Jia bao vowed to use an "iron hand" to reach energy-efficiency targets after it was revealed that energy intensity rose 3.2% in the first quarter 

compared with the year-earlier first quarter, reversing a steady decline. 
Energy intensity is closely linked to reducing greenhouse gases because most of China's power comes from burning fossil fuels, like coal, which release carbon. 
Mr. Zhang promised tougher enforcement and said that six regional supervision centers had been set up to monitor implementation of environmental regulations. 
But critics say the environmental watchdog, which was promoted to ministerial level two years ago to give it more standing, doesn't have either the manpower or the legal 

power to adequately police polluters. 

Critics also say that many of China's recent environmental improvements came because polluting factories had stopped working during the global recession, and these are now operating again. Mr. Zhang defended his ministry's reputation, saying it had rejected 190.5 billion yuan, nearly $28 billion, worth of construction projects last year after they failed to meet 
environmental standards. He also said the ministry had penalized almost 2,000 industrial projects that started operations before getting regulator approval. Credit: By Shai Oster

Full Text 
Coal miner Consol Energy Inc. is working on a project to capture and destroy methane gas, a natural byproduct of coal mining that can trigger underground explosions and can add to greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Consol's project is one of only a handful around the world but is expected to be replicated as mining companies seek to capture greenhouse gas in order to sell carbon-offset credits to utilities and others. China and Australia, the world's No. 1 and No. 4 coal producers, respectively, also have launched programs to capture methane. 
In the U.S., many expect climate legislation being considered in Congress to speed the growth of gas-capture projects because of the potential profits of selling emissions credits. 
"What really triggered this project and moved it forward was the potential to sell carbon offsets," said Steve Winburg, Consol's vice president for research and development. Consol plans to sell carbon credits to a utility to cover the project's $5 million cost. The company expects to turn a profit on it as early as this year. 
Consol and its development partner Verdeo Group Inc. expects to capture and destroy methane equivalent to 230,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year at Consol's McElroy Mine south of Wheeling, W.Va. Methane occurs naturally in coal seams and must be vented from mines before reaching explosive levels. 
Federal mine-safety officials believe the April explosion at a Massey Energy Co. underground mine was caused by high levels of methane, though it's not clear how the methane was allowed to build up or what ignited it. 
Coal mines have traditionally vented methane into the atmosphere, which raises environmental concerns, because it is 21 times more potent as a global-warming gas than carbon dioxide. Coal-mine-ventilation systems are the biggest source of methane emissions, accounting for 81 billion cubic feet, or 51% of coal-mine methane emissions in 2006, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Some in the mining industry, however, believe the government could extend regulatory oversight to methane in the future. "The relatively low priority assigned to methane may be about to change," said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. He said the EPA will finalize a rule this summer that requires mine operators to monitor and report methane emissions. 
Consol's project uses a technology similar to ones that have been used in automotive, chemical and wood-products industries that emit noxious gases. Methane, by comparison, isn't noxious. Air from Consol's McElroy Mine next year will be pulled out with a powerful fan and sent through a heated ceramic that oxidizes the methane and turns it into carbon dioxide and water. 
Coal mines use massive fans to bring fresh air to miners as well as push harmful gases out. Methane is removed continuously so that it doesn't reach explosive concentrations of between 5% and 15%. Consol said the air leaving its ventilation system will be between 0.6% and 1.2% methane, far too low to be sold commercially. 
Verdeo, of Washington, D.C., develops projects to capture methane and other greenhouse gases for mining and oil and gas companies.

Corrections & Amplifications 
The National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday issued a report about climate change. In some editions Thursday, a U.S. News article about the report incorrectly identified the 
organization as the National Academy of Scientists. 
(WSJ May 21, 2010) 
The National Academy of Scientists, a group of elite American researchers that advises the U.S. government, on Wednesday issued an 869-page report reasserting mankind's 

role in altering the climate and calling for specific policy measures to help forestall undesirable effects. 

The report, requested by Congress 2008, essentially supports the main findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body whose most recent 
report released in 2007 was criticized for containing several errors. 
Those errors and the publishing of unflattering emails hacked from a U.K. lab have put climate-change science in the hot seat in recent months. 
"Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks," the academy report concludes. The peer-reviewed study was done by 55 

scientists from academia, industry and elsewhere vetted by the academy. 

In some areas, the study provides a more up-to-date assessment of climate change. "We carefully looked at the scientific literature of the last five years, our own [academy] 
research," plus other sources, said Pamela Matson, dean of Stanford University's school of earth sciences, who helped compile the report. 
Nonetheless, the academy acknowledged that there is significant uncertainty when attempting longer-term predictions about climate change. 
For example, the 2007 IPCC report said sea levels could rise by between 0.6 and 1.9 feet by 2100, but later studies suggested that forecast was too conservative. The 

academy's report incorporates the newer research and concludes that sea levels could rise by as much as 6.5 feet in that period. 
The new report also urges the U.S. to take bold steps to cut fossil-fuel use, calling for a carbon tax on such fuels -- mainly oil and coal -- or a cap-and-trade system, which 

offers monetary incentives to cut emissions of pollutants. Those recommendations are a big step up from the less-sharply-worded prescriptions issued by the academy in the 
past. 
"The charge we got from Congress was not just to tell them what the science says but what to do about the problem," said Robert Fri, a visiting scholar at the nonprofit 

Resources for the Future, who helped compile the report. 

The report says that the U.S. emissions of between 170 billion to 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2012 until 2050 would be a "reasonable goal," in line with 
reduction targets proposed by the White House. In 2008, the U.S. emitted about seven billion tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent.

Abstract 
The bill would also subsidize loan guarantees to expand nuclear power, which is the GOP analogue to Democratic wind turbines and solar panels. 

Full Text 
Despite the most creative rhetoric this side of ObamaCare, voters have figured out that "cap and trade" involves artificial carbon rationing and vast new energy taxes. So the main goal of John Kerry and Joe Lieberman has been attempting to disguise these truths in the climate bill they released to much fanfare last week. 
The bill was nine months in gestation once it became clear that the version the House passed last summer -- which one of five Democrats opposed -- was doomed in the Senate. Yet no one should mistake Kerry-Lieberman for a new approach. 
Jim Lucier, an investment analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, calls it the Mr. Potato Head bill. The cosmetic features can be rearranged, but it's still a Mr. Potato Head. This is still cap and tax -- except with new and larger subsidies, outright corporate bribes, and the rest of the political palm-greasing that Democrats hope can still lead to a Rose Garden ceremony this year. 
The bill sets a 2020 target for reducing CO2 emissions by 17% from 2005 levels, and 83% by 2050, the same as the House. Of course, please don't say this has anything to do with global warming. "We don't want to mix messages here," Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said on Earth Day. "I'm all for protecting the Earth, but this is about energy independence." 
Mr. Graham helped Messrs. Kerry and Lieberman write the bill before bailing out last month. Their main innovation was to create separate regulations for transportation, utilities and manufacturing. The goal is to buy industry support by offering special short-term favors to each one -- but also to hide the taxes that will hit all forms of carbon energy, and thus most goods and services. 
Producers and importers of gasoline and jet fuel, for example, would be cordoned off from the wider carbon-permit auctions and instead buy separate, nontradable allowances pegged to the fixed price at which the auction closes. The technical term for this is a "linked fee," but consumers are unlikely to observe the distinction when pump prices rise under this de facto gas tax. 
"There is no gas tax, never was a gas tax, will not be a gas tax, I don't know where that came from, but it is just wrong. Period," Mr. Kerry rumbled at a press conference in late April. "There is not even a linked fee, there is not a tax, there is nothing similar." No, except for the gas tax that dare not speak its name. 
Messrs. Kerry and Lieberman hope to peel off a few Republicans with sweeteners like more offshore drilling and royalty-sharing for coastal states. Given the Gulf oil leak, liberals may not accept even this fillip. The bill would also subsidize loan guarantees to expand nuclear power, which is the GOP analogue to Democratic wind turbines and solar panels. 
Despite media caricature, the main obstacle to cap and tax isn't Republican intransigence. Energy politics splits on geographic more than partisan lines, and the folks in the hinterlands who rely on coal-fired power and heavy manufacturing will get socked the hardest. Midwest Democrats are Mr. Kerry's real opposition. 
Big business is on board for the subsidies, and even the Chamber of Commerce had kind words for this "work in progress." The bill landed with endorsements from such luminaries as John Doerr, a Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist and Al Gore's business partner; John Rowe, the CEO of the nuclear utility Exelon; and Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric. Every business or interest that could afford a half-competent lobbyist stands to benefit, at least until cap and tax is in place and environmentalists crack down over time. 
Oh, and since America is not a planet, Kerry-Lieberman will have little to no effect on global CO2 concentrations as the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian economies expand. But the bill would impose carbon tariffs on countries that don't adopt similar restrictions, likely leading to a trade war. 
The Beltway wisdom says this combination of corporate welfare and economic destruction has little chance to pass this year, but don't be so sure. The left and Mr. Obama know their supermajorities are about to vanish, and they are ideologically willful enough to make one more effort to jam this through the Senate. They just won't call it a gas tax, or cap and trade, or anything close to what it really is.

Abstract 
Life settlements, in which older adults sell their life-insurance policies to investors at a discount to face value, have drawn scrutiny for the industry's high fees, opaque nature and aggressive sales practices. [...] the economic turmoil of 2008 and 2009, a growing number of people had been selling their own life-insurance policies to investors in exchange for a lump-sum payment, according to data collected by Conning Research & Consulting in Hartford, Conn. 

Full Text 
Many investors in their 50s and 60s are desperate to bulk up their nest eggs. But they remain skittish about the stock market -- and are frustrated with low interest rates. 
It's a combination that makes them especially susceptible to fraud. "Anybody who's even thinking about retiring is panicking because they're going to outlive their savings," says Joseph Borg, Alabama's top securities regulator. "Along comes a scam artist with a guaranteed, super-safe deal. It's a perfect storm." 
State securities agencies have seen their caseloads explode in the past year. And nearly half of investor complaints involve investment fraud targeting people age 60 and older, according to the North American Securities Administrators Association, based in Washington, D.C. 
What are the latest schemes? What should people be on the lookout for? Here are some of the newest types of fraud, according to those who keep track, and how to steer clear of scams. 
Despite the bursting of the housing bubble, many longtime homeowners still have substantial equity. Some salespeople are inducing them to lend that money, by means of credit lines or reverse mortgages, to limited- liability companies or partnerships promising steady returns. 
Kim Cooper, a 47-year-old home-health nurse in Orange County, Calif., used $100,000 from a home-equity line of credit to invest in April 2008 with a local firm, MacArthur Birch LLC. She believed her money would go into a trust buying international securities, and she received a promissory note pledging a 5% monthly return for a year, she says. Instead, Ms. Cooper lost her money. 
"We were told all kinds of things -- the money was frozen, Homeland Security had the money in a New York bank because they wanted to make sure it wasn't being laundered," she says. "They kept us hanging on." 
The California Department of Corporations, which regulates securities, issued a "desist and refrain order" against MacArthur Birch and two of its managers in October for selling investment contracts without telling investors that their money would be put into another trust. The state also said in its order that the firm didn't tell investors that the state had issued a similar order against that trust in 2007. 
MacArthur Birch requested a hearing on the order, set for Aug. 26 in Los Angeles. The firm's managers and attorney didn't return phone messages or emails seeking comment. 
Promissory notes like the one issued to Ms. Cooper are becoming more common, says Pat Huddleston, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney in Atlanta who has started a service offering due diligence on investments for individuals (investorswatchdog.com). "They look contractual, and they purport to pay interest like bank accounts, CDs and other things that are solid and reliable," says Mr. Huddleston. "It makes an investment look really safe, even when it's not." 
Of course, there are legitimate reasons for home-equity loans and reverse mortgages, such as supplementing retirement income to pay long-term-care costs or rising property taxes. But be wary of anyone who recommends that you take out such a loan to make an investment. 
Life settlements, in which older adults sell their life-insurance policies to investors at a discount to face value, have drawn scrutiny for the industry's high fees, opaque nature and aggressive sales practices. Now there are concerns about fraud in the "securitizing" of life settlements. Some companies are packaging hundreds of policies and using them to back the sale of notes. That means the policies being securitized could be overvalued -- or faked, says Denise Voigt Crawford, Texas securities commissioner. 
Last year, Texas investigators seized about $20 million in assets from National Life Settlements LLC, a Houston company that sold secured notes backed by life-settlement contracts and promising up to 10% annual interest to about 320 investors, including retired teachers. The state considered the investments to be unregistered securities, and a court-appointed receiver testified that the firm paid new investors with money from earlier ones, rather than investing in life settlements. 
A Texas district-court judge issued a permanent injunction against the company's doing business in the state and appointed a permanent receiver to return investors' money. 
National Life Settlements' principals, Howard Judah Jr. and Gregory Jablonski, settled the claim without admitting to the state's charges. "The state's position was that these were securities, and our clients' position is that this was an insurance product," says Brent Haynes, a Houston lawyer who represented them. 
One important distinction: Until the economic turmoil of 2008 and 2009, a growing number of people had been selling their own life-insurance policies to investors in exchange for a lump-sum payment, according to data collected by Conning Research & Consulting in Hartford, Conn. (A lack of capital in the life-settlement market has slowed the market in the past few years.) For older people who no longer need the policies and could use the money now , this may be a reasonable decision -- and is different from investing in a securitized group of such investments. 
Heightened awareness of global warming, along with President Barack Obama's challenge to end U.S. dependency on foreign oil, has created a pool of baby boomers receptive to "green" investments -- some of which are fakes, Mr. Huddleston says. 
Late last year, the SEC accused Nova Gen Corp., San Diego, which claimed to own technology capable of converting coal into virtually emissions-free biodiesel fuel, of making false statements and selling unregistered stock. Nova Gen projected "wildly unrealistic" revenue based on building power plants for which it lacked permits and funding, according to the SEC's complaint, filed in December in federal court in San Diego. "In reality, Nova Gen is a shell of a company that has no operational technology and no revenues," the complaint says. 
Nova Gen has denied the allegations in court filings. The company's lawyer didn't return calls seeking comment. 
Of course, alternative energy is a hot new investment category with legitimate ways to make money. But you'd be better off seeking out a mutual fund, or exchange-traded fund, that would use a small portion of your equity investments, to diversify your overall portfolio. 
Scams in which a company offers to buy and store gold for investors -- and to sell the material when it increases in value -- are also increasing, says Judith Shaw, Maine's securities administrator. The problem: "In many cases, the gold doesn't exist," she says. 
The right way to invest: Go through a reputable, local gold dealer, Ms. Shaw says. If you don't want to hold onto the bullion yourself, carefully evaluate the seller's offer to store it for you. "Purchasing your precious metal from somebody who's local is far and away better than doing it over the Internet," she says. "Our message always is, 'Please just call us first to check them out.'" 
Although every investment has its own set of wrinkles, there are some basic ways to steer clear of various types of investment fraud. If it seems nearly impossible to evaluate an investment product's underlying risks, "avoid it like the plague," Ms. Crawford says. 
Also, don't sign anything presented as "top secret." Ms. Cooper, for example, was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, so she didn't tell her financial planner about the investment until it was too late to get her money back. 
Don't invest with your home equity, either. Ms. Cooper is spending an extra $1,000 a month to pay back the home-equity loan she used to invest with MacArthur Birch and worries how she'll afford a new car, which she needs to do her job. 
Things you should do: Start with your own background check on the investment and the people pitching it. A good first stop is your state securities department. Go to nasaa.org and click on "Contact Your Regulator." State officials should be able to tell you whether a security is registered, and if it's not, why it isn't. The same agency can tell you if the salesperson is licensed to sell securities where you live. You can also check an investment adviser's history by going to finra.org, clicking on "Investors" and then going to "Finra BrokerCheck." 
Seeking out the background of the people involved in creating and selling a product could be even more important. Check with state securities regulators everywhere the people have lived for any actions brought against them. Check federal or state databases for bankruptcy or criminal filings, too. 
"A company can always file with [a] secretary of state or create an accounting firm to do an audit and look legitimate," Mr. Huddleston says. "But a scam artist can't hide his own background as easily."

World News: China Acts to Raise Profile on Climate Change

Abstract 
Most of China's energy comes from burning coal, a major source of carbon emissions. [...] last year, China was doing pretty well, lowering the relative use of energy by 14.4%, the government said. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- China is trying to strengthen its role as leader of the developing world in climate-change talks just as it faces an embarrassing setback in trying to curb its own carbon emissions. 
This weekend, China is hosting a global-warming forum that will feature the country's top leaders and ministers from key negotiating blocs in the developing world, including its fellow Basic Group members Brazil, South Africa and India. 
China's reputation as a leader on fighting climate change was battered by accusations it sabotaged efforts to reach a binding deal last year. 
"This forum is getting the key pieces of the jigsaw puzzle," said Li Yan, a climate-change specialist at Greenpeace. The composition of the forum participants "serves the purpose of sending out a signal to the world of the role China wants to play." 
At the last round of big global climate negotiations, in Copenhagen in December, China positioned itself as the protector of the interests of the developing world against the industrialized nations led by the U.S. But when the talks failed to reach a binding agreement and instead produced a weaker last-minute accord brokered by the U.S. and China, some blamed China. 
In the finger-pointing that followed, cracks showed in the alliance of the world's poorer countries, such as smaller island states that felt betrayed by China. 
One of China's top climate change negotiators played down expectations for a climate treaty this year in comments Friday. 
But the forum will also have a domestic target. Analysts said Beijing will use it to send a strong signal to local governments that it is serious about reaching energy-efficiency targets, which are important to China's promise to reduce energy intensity -- the amount of energy used to produce each dollar of gross domestic product. 
Such a signal is especially urgent after news that China's infrastructure and housing-led economic recovery increased the country's energy intensity 3.2% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, reversing a steady decline. China said it would cut energy intensity 20% by the end of this year, a goal that is closely tied to the country's promise to the international community to reduce its carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon emitted per dollar of GDP -- by 40% to 45% by 2020. Most of China's energy comes from burning coal, a major source of carbon emissions. 
Until last year, China was doing pretty well, lowering the relative use of energy by 14.4%, the government said. 
The setback was announced earlier this week, when Premier Wen Jiabao pledged to use an "iron hand" to crack down on polluting industries and earmarked an extra $12 billion to increase energy efficiency. 
Beijing said it would take extreme measures to cut back on energy waste.

PPL to Pay $6.7 Billion For E.ON's U.S. Business

Abstract 
PPL's business is split between electricity-delivery utility operations in Pennsylvania and the U.K. and a U.S. generation business that sells power at wholesale market prices rather than regulated rates. 

Full Text 
Pennsylvania utility PPL Corp. is acquiring the regulated U.S. business of Germany's E.ON AG for $6.7 billion in cash, signaling growing confidence in the mergers market as both 
stock and credit markets recover. 
The deal will push Allentown-based PPL into new territories in the South, and shows its ambitions to become a more formidable U.S. utility business. With the acquisition, PPL 
will add two Kentucky utilities -- Louisville Gas & Electricity Co. and the Kentucky Utilities Co. -- supplying more than 1.2 million customers as it increases focus on the less 
risky, utility side of its business. 

"Creating that balance rather than being highly leveraged to the wholesale [power] markets is going to create much more value to the shareholders," PPL's Chairman and Chief 
Executive James Miller said in an interview. 

For E.ON, the sale is part of a plan by the world's largest investor-owned utility to streamline operations and cut debt. 
The deal is part of stepped-up merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. power sector as companies combine and reshuffle operations amid a prolonged downturn in wholesale 
electricity prices. In February, FirstEnergy Corp. agreed to a $4.7 billion takeover of Allegheny Energy Inc., while Pepco Holdings Inc. announced last week it would sell its power 
plants to Calpine Corp. for $1.65 billion to focus on its regulated electricity-delivery businesses. 

Like other U.S. utility deals, E.ON's divestiture must win regulatory approval, a process that has stymied similar transactions in recent years as state regulators push for 

consumer benefits. 
Mr. Miller said the acquisition isn't expected to produce cost savings, which often drive corporate consolidations. PPL doesn't plan to cut staff and will keep its existing 
management. 

PPL's business is split between electricity-delivery utility operations in Pennsylvania and the U.K. and a U.S. generation business that sells power at wholesale market prices 
rather than regulated rates. The Kentucky assets it is acquiring include a fleet of mostly coal-fired power plants. 

PPL's existing plants are heavily coal, which power companies have been moving away from amid concerns over possible federal climate change rules. 
The price tag exceeded the expectations of some analysts, who estimated that E.ON U.S. was worth over $5 billion. PPL will also assume $925 million of E.ON U.S.'s tax-exempt 
debt. 

Investors pushed PPL shares down nearly 8% to $25.60 in 4 p.m. trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange after news reports identified it as the likely buyer. 

People involved in the transaction defended the deal Wednesday, saying that the company retained good management and that there are a number of tax benefits embedded in 
the purchase price. 
PPL is expected to finance the all-cash deal with a short-term, $6.5 billion bridge loan from Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group and will issue new stock and debt 

and use cash to fund the transaction. 

E.ON U.S. has about 3,100 employees and owns and operates about 8,000 megawatts of regulated electric generation capacity. PPL plans to operate the acquired businesses as 
a wholly owned subsidiary. 
Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch served as PPL's financial advisers and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as legal adviser. Goldman Sachs, Blackstone Group and 

Sullivan & Cromwell LLP advised E.ON.

Abstract 
The country uses fossil fuels -- chiefly coal -- for around 90% of its electricity generation, making it the biggest per-capita polluter in the developed world. 

Full Text 
CANBERRA -- Australia will delay a plan to curb the nation's greenhouse-gas emissions until after the Kyoto Protocol on global emissions expires at the end of 2012, Prime 
Minister Kevin Rudd said. 
The decision marks the latest setback for efforts by nations to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, after world leaders failed to reach a binding agreement in Copenhagen in 
December. 

Mr. Rudd's center-left Labor Party faces pressure in an election year from a resurgent conservative movement that describes the system as a "great big new tax." 

Mr. Rudd was elected in November 2007 in large part on his pledge to make Australia greener. The country uses fossil fuels -- chiefly coal -- for around 90% of its electricity 
generation, making it the biggest per-capita polluter in the developed world. 
The prime minister signed documents to ratify the Kyoto pact as his first act in office, making the U.S. the only major developed economy not bound by mandatory caps. But 

like the U.S., Australia is a heavily industrialized economy, and Mr. Rudd faced stiff resistance to his plan, which would implement a market-based cap-and-trade system 

designed to give businesses incentives to curb emissions. 
The plan has weighed on Mr. Rudd's popularity in polls since Tony Abbott ousted the more moderate Malcolm Turnbull -- who was poised to back the plan -- as leader of the 
main opposition Liberal-National coalition late last year. 

An election must be held by April 2011, but analysts say it is likely to be called sometime after mid-August. 

Mr. Abbott said the delay was a "big issue for the government's credibility. . . . This was the prime minister who said that [climate change] was the greatest moral challenge of 
our time and now he doesn't have a policy to deal with it." 
The proposal, which would have seen Australia adopt a market-based emissions trading system similar to one already operating in Europe from July 2011, has been stalled since 

being rejected for a second time by Australia's Senate in December. 

Debate had been due to resume next month but had little prospect of being approved while both the Liberal-National opposition and the environmentalist Greens party opposed 
it. 
The government needs the Senate support of either the Liberal -- National coalition or all of its minor party senators to pass any new laws. 
Climate change remains a "core concern" for the government, Mr. Rudd said Tuesday. But local opposition and slow progress in the realization of global action on climate change 

"inevitably mean that the implementation of a carbon-pollution reduction scheme in Australia will be delayed," Mr. Rudd said. 

After Kyoto's expiration, "governments around the world will be required to make clear their commitments for the post-2012 period," he said. "The Australian government at 
that time . . . will be in a better position to assess the level of global action on climate change." 
The original targets, which would see Australia reduce its carbon emissions by 5% compared with year 2000 levels by 2020, are unchanged, he added. 
Environmental groups described any delay in implementing the scheme as "reckless." 
"It's not government for the good of Australia or even the good of humanity. We are still emerging from delicate global talks. We actually think there's been better momentum 

but Australia taking an act like this really throws us back five years," said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute. Credit: By Rachel Pannett

Abstract 
Shaw Group, a Baton Rouge, La., engineering and construction firm for utilities, said two-thirds of U.S. coal-fired power plants would need to be equipped with pollution-control equipment or converted to cleaner-burning fuels in the next 10 years, or retired. 

Full Text 
Power companies are switching generating plants from coal to natural gas or other less-polluting fuels, in response to tighter clean-air rules and big gas finds expected to keep prices low for years. 
Among the big electricity generators making the move are Calpine Corp., Progress Energy Inc. and Southern Co. 
Calpine, of Houston, is the latest to trumpet plant conversions, part of a deal announced Wednesday in which it will buy 19 power plants from Pepco Holdings Inc. for $1.65 billion. Most of the plants burn natural gas, and Calpine was quick to reassure investors it would convert coal-burning units in Delaware and New Jersey to gas, too. 
"They were older coal plants, due for upgrades," said Jack Fusco, Calpine's chief executive. 
Shaw Group, a Baton Rouge, La., engineering and construction firm for utilities, said two-thirds of U.S. coal-fired power plants would need to be equipped with pollution-control equipment or converted to cleaner-burning fuels in the next 10 years, or retired. The remaining one-third already were getting pollution controls. 
Jim Bernhard Jr., chief executive and co-founder of Shaw, estimated utilities would spend $10 billion on fuel conversions or installing pollution controls. 
Progress Energy of Raleigh, N.C., intends to shut 11 coal-burning plants in North Carolina by 2017, representing about a third of its capacity there. It is building gas-fired plants at two of the four sites. Spokesman Mike Hughes said it would cost $1.5 billion to swap coal capacity for gas capacity but would have cost more than $2 billion to equip the coal units with pollution-control equipment. 
After 2017, Progress will have only three coal-burning power plants in North Carolina -- basically just units that were big enough and new enough to justify a $1 billion investment in scrubbers. 
The conversions are happening when relatively few power plants are being built. Early in the decade, many utilities said they intended to build coal units, but most projects have been canceled due to concerns about pollution and the impact of carbon dioxide on climate change. 
Some of those that have gone forward have experienced startling cost overruns. Perhaps the most prominent is Duke Energy Corp.'s "clean coal" plant in Indiana, which is 57% complete. Duke said this month the Edwardsport project's expected cost has ballooned by about $900 million since 2007, to $2.88 billion from $1.98 billion. The current price tag is $530 million more than the amount approved by Indiana regulators. Duke blames "design evolution." 
The Edwardsport plant will convert coal to a cleaner-burning flammable gas. Duke warned, in a regulatory filing, that the plant's costs could push up electricity rates by nearly 20% after 2012, when it enters service. 
The coal lobby is fighting state efforts to accelerate a trend away from coal and says state laws adverse to coal will cost jobs and raise energy costs. In Colorado, the lobby fought a bill signed into law this week that forces utilities to cut emissions.

Abstract 
Europe is making a huge bet on wind energy. Because there is little room in its crowded countryside for sprawling wind-tower complexes, planners are increasingly looking to the sea. 

Full text 
OFF THE COAST OF KENT, England -- A phalanx of sleek white windmills, rising nearly 400 feet out of the North Sea, is just the start of one of the world's most audacious green-energy programs. 
The turbines are part of a project expected to be the world's largest offshore wind farm when it is completed later this year. But only for a while, because it's a prelude to something much bigger. In a few years, its developer, Swedish energy company Vattenfall AB, plans to start a new project farther offshore, in deeper waters, with turbines as tall as London's 580-foot Gherkin skyscraper. 
Just one problem: Vattenfall has no idea how it's going to build it. "The equipment we need to operate in such rough waters doesn't exist yet," says Ole Bigum Nielsen, the project manager. 
Europe is making a huge bet on wind energy. Because there is little room in its crowded countryside for sprawling wind-tower complexes, planners are increasingly looking to the sea. Europe's current 2,000 megawatts of offshore generating capacity will grow at least 40,000 megawatts by 2020, enough to power more than 25 million households, the European Wind Energy Association predicts. 
Britain is making the biggest wind wager. By offering generous incentives, the U.K. already has built more offshore wind power than any other nation. Now it is planning a wave of vast new wind farms, in some of Europe's stormiest waters. 
The U.K.'s commitment is driven by stringent European Union targets. To meet them, Britain will have to raise the share of its electricity that comes from renewable sources to about 30% by 2020. It's just 7% now. The U.K. also adopted a "carbon budget" a year ago, committing to reduce emissions to at least 34% below 1990 levels by 2018-2022. 
Some dismiss the windmills as quixotic. Wind energy needs massive subsidies to be economic. The cost to carry out Britain's plans is estimated at $150 billion. Some predict a consumer backlash against resulting higher energy bills. And many more challenges await, judging from those the project at Kent faced, ranging from the need to protect marine worms to a design flaw that causes turbines to sink into their foundations. 
"The danger is that we might end up paying a huge amount of money trying to achieve this [EU] target and then failing anyway," says Michael Pollitt, head of the Electricity Policy Research Group at Cambridge University. "The most sensible thing to do is abandon the target." 
For now, Britain is sticking to its goals. With two rounds of projects in operation or being built, the government in January awarded a third round of licenses, for nine enormous wind farms stretching from Scotland's Moray Firth to the Isle of Wight in southern England. 
The government envisages more than 6,000 huge turbines in British waters by decade's end. Together, the projects are supposed to meet a third of Britain's electricity needs by 2020. 
"Of any renewables program in the world, this is probably the most ambitious," says David Still, head of the European arm of U.S. turbine manufacturer Clipper Windpower Inc. "It's a major opportunity for the global wind business." 
Some of the sector's biggest players are piling in. General Electric Co. says it will invest <euro>110 million (about $150 million) in a turbine plant in the U.K. A unit of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. is to spend about $154 million here on turbine development. Clipper plans to build massive turbine blades at a new factory near Newcastle. 
The program is a leap in the dark. The wind farms under the first two licensing rounds, such as Vattenfall's $1.2 billion venture off the coast of Kent, which is known as Thanet, are in relatively shallow waters a few miles off the coast. But most Round 3 projects will be in water over 90 feet deep, some 180 miles offshore. Far out in the stormy North Sea, they must withstand 30-foot waves and 60-mile-an-hour winds. Righting one that tips would be a formidable task. 
Just hauling them out and installing them is hard enough, given a shortage of vessels large enough to do the job. That challenge will grow as the machines get bigger, like a 10­megawatt turbine Clipper is developing with skyscraper-size blades. All in all, the price tag for wind parks at sea can be three times an onshore equivalent. 
"Offshore wind is one of the most expensive short-term ways you can conceive of to reduce CO2 emissions," says Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University. "It's economic nonsense to put all your eggs in one basket like this." 
Dr. Helm says the most cost-effective way of "de-carbonizing" U.K. energy, at least in the short term, would be to switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas in power generation. "If you take out 4 to 5 gigawatts of coal and replace it with gas, the CO2 savings would be similar and it would only cost GBP 5 billion to GBP 7 billion, compared to GBP 100 billion for offshore wind," he says. 
He thinks many Round 3 projects will never see the light of day. "Companies bought the options on licenses, and they're not required to develop those options by a particular date," he says. "My sense is they'll build some, but won't try too hard." 
Vattenfall, which has a license for one Round 3 project, off East Anglia, hasn't made the final go-ahead decision but has committed funds for surveys, permits and such. Construction isn't supposed to start until 2015. 
Boosters of wind farms say that though they have high up-front costs, once built they are cheaper to run than plants burning coal or gas, because wind is free. "There'll be no gas left in 50 years' time, whereas we have an infinity of wind," says Eddie O'Connor, head of Mainstream Renewable Power, a big player in offshore wind. 
The origins of Britain's dash for wind power lie in a 2007 EU summit meeting. The bloc pledged a 20% cut in emissions believed to cause global warming and agreed to boost the proportion of energy derived from renewable sources to 20%, both by 2020. 
For some countries, the targets aren't difficult. Many started switching away from fossil fuels after the first oil-price shock in the 1970s. Sweden came to rely heavily on hydropower, France on nuclear. 
Britain, blessed with North Sea oil and gas, didn't need to change. In 2005, it was getting just 1.3% of its energy from renewables. To catch up, wind appeared a sensible way to go. Solar was less attractive in a place with so little sunshine. 
But onshore wind farms often were thwarted by not-in-my-backyard groups, which among other things called them a blot on the landscape. Companies began to think about putting them out of sight, at sea. 
Clipper's Mr. Still was a pioneer. In 2000, a small firm he then headed built the U.K.'s first offshore wind farm off Blyth in northeastern England, a modest project that powered 1,500 homes. "No one else was doing it. We wanted to be adventurous," he says. 
He received an enthusiastic response from the Crown Estate, an independent agency that owns Britain's seabed. It saw the potential: The British Isles' territorial waters cover a greater area than those of any other European country, and with their prevailing westerlies they are uncommonly gusty. 
Another plus: Britain's decades of experience pumping oil in the North Sea. The idea was that oil-service companies that install rigs and pipelines could switch to deploying wind turbines and power cables. Big European utilities such as Germany's E.ON AG, DONG Energy of Denmark and Iberdrola SA of Spain started investing in U.K. wind. 
There were setbacks. Though wind technology costs initially declined as it matured, as many technologies do, a surge in metals prices and a weaker pound pushed up costs. The 2008 credit crunch squeezed financing and stalled some projects. 
That year, a consortium including Royal Dutch Shell PLC and DONG abandoned plans to place turbines in the Irish Sea after the Ministry of Defence said they would interfere with radar signals. Like civil aviation authorities, the Defence Ministry has to be consulted on every project and has often blocked those that could affect radar or air-traffic control. 
The government moved to make wind attractive to investors with a lavish subsidy regime. For each megawatt hour of electricity a company produces from a green-energy source, it is awarded one "Renewables Obligation Certificate," or ROC. Power producers sell these to electric utilities, which buy them to meet a government mandate for use of renewable power. 
The utilities pass much of the cost on to customers. The system adds around $18 to the average household's annual electricity bill, according to the UK's energy regulator. 
An operator of a single offshore turbine producing 9,000 megawatt hours a year can earn $1 million from selling its ROCs, because offshore projects get 1 1/2 ROCs per megawatt hour instead of one. Soon such projects will get two, if accredited by the end of 2010. Some think the deep-water Round 3 projects will require even more support. 
Sweden's Vattenfall, by 2008, was looking offshore for places to build large wind farms. "There are no places onshore in Europe where you can put up 100 or 200 turbines like you can in the U.S. and Canada," says the company's Mr. Nielsen. Vattenfall acquired the Thanet project off Kent from a small firm that folded in the credit crisis. 
Though the rationale of wind is environmental, other environment issues intruded. Thanet's initial developer had to change the location of some turbines to avoid reefs that are formed by a marine worm called sabellaria spinulosa. 
U.K. authorities banned pile-driving work in the spring, fearing the noise would scare off a type of herring that spawns in the Thames Estuary. After months of discussions, the 
restriction was lifted. 
When seals, whales or dolphins were in the area, work couldn't start until they left. Undersea cables linking turbines had to be specially routed to avoid historic shipwrecks. 
Weather often interfered. For much of the 2009 fall and winter, the seas off Kent were too rough for work. 

Vattenfall also couldn't find enough local steel to build the 500-ton foundations for the turbines. They had to be imported, as did skilled workers and the turbines themselves. One of the biggest challenges remains finding ships to install the huge and cumbersome equipment. To lay cables, Vattenfall is hiring a ship called the Polar Prince, but it is among the few of its kind and has a customer waiting list. A delay on one project can wreck the schedules of others. 
The costs can be exorbitant. To deploy an offshore electrical substation, Vattenfall used a state-of-the-art heavy-lift ship called the Stanislav Yudin that rents for $450,000 a day. Some new installation ships are under construction, including one in a Korean shipyard big enough to install the huge new turbines that are being planned. But many more will be needed. 
Late last year, another headache arose. Owners of a Dutch wind farm found their turbines had shifted a few inches, the result of a design flaw in equipment connecting the towers to their foundations. RenewableUK, a trade association, said most of the 336 turbines operating in U.K. waters could have the same fault, and would cost about $250,000 each to fix. 
Vattenfall rushed to check its North Sea machines and found many had sunk slightly into their foundations. It is now figuring out how to repair them. 
"It's an example of how this is a young industry, and we haven't yet reached the maturity we need," Mr. Nielsen says.

Abstract 
In announcing the first guarantees for two new reactors planned in Georgia, President Obama made clear the connection he sees with global warming: "To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change," he said, "we need to increase our supply of nuclear power." 

Full Text 
By the end of the 1980s, the nuclear-power industry appeared to be heading for a meltdown. 
The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 confirmed many people's fears about the danger of nuclear power and led to expensive safety upgrades for planned and existing plants. A recession slashed demand for electricity, inflation made new nuclear plants more expensive and falling energy prices made nuclear power less competitive with other power sources. 
Then, in 1986, the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine killed at least 56 people directly and spread radiation throughout much of Europe. Responding to "no nukes" sentiment, many states blocked new plant construction, and some European countries called for shutting down existing plants. 
Twenty years later, though, nuclear power may have found its reason for being: global warming. Several leading environmentalists have come out in favor of nuclear power because it is a low-carbon, plentiful source of electricity that could replace dirty coal, especially in rapidly growing countries such as China and India. 
"Coal is the major villain when it comes to greenhouse gases," says Stewart Brand, founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and a former nuclear-power opponent who is now an avid supporter. "Countries are discovering that wind and solar are good to do, and they make a dent. But when it comes to base-load, always-on power, we have nothing that really replaces coal except nuclear." 
Meanwhile, public support for nuclear power is growing. A March Gallup survey found 62% of those asked favor nuclear power, the highest level since Gallup began polling on the subject in 1994. In a handful of unscientific surveys on environmental Web sites, a small majority say they are willing to give nuclear power another look as a way to fight climate change. Others, including those who don't believe global warming is a real problem, favor nuclear power as a way to give the U.S. more energy security. 
Governments, too, are being swayed to back nuclear power as a way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. In Sweden, officials recently introduced legislation to allow construction of new nuclear-power plants; the country, which gets more than 40% of its electricity from nuclear, banned new plant construction in the early 1980s and planned to phase out existing plants. 
In the U.S., President Barack Obama has called for increased loan guarantees to help finance a new round of nuclear-plant construction. In announcing the first guarantees for two new reactors planned in Georgia, President Obama made clear the connection he sees with global warming: "To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change," he said, "we need to increase our supply of nuclear power." 
Climate change isn't the first environmental problem that nuclear power promised to solve. Leaders of the Sierra Club favored nuclear power in the 1960s as an alternative to large-scale hydropower dams in the Grand Canyon. The group's board later supported plans for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, a move that deeply divided the organization; it currently opposes nuclear power. Utilities, meanwhile, saw nuclear power as a way to meet the country's soaring demand for electricity without adding to air pollution. 
Environmentalist opposition to nuclear power began to build in the 1970s amid increasing concerns about the safety of a new generation of larger reactors. Safety concerns were highlighted by the March 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, caused by a combination of operator error and the failure of key components of the cooling systems. The accident came two weeks after the release the antinuclear movie "The China Syndrome" and served as a flash point of opposition to atomic power. 
At the same time, the industry began to retrench -- but not because of hostility from environmentalists. Even before Three Mile Island, utilities had begun canceling orders for new reactors -- the last order was placed in 1978 -- when it became apparent electricity demand wouldn't grow as fast as expected. Construction and capital costs were rising as well, in part because regulators were insisting on better safety features, but mostly because of inflation. While dozens of new reactors already in the pipeline came online during the 1980s, scores of units were canceled or put on hold. Some European countries, notably Sweden and Germany, decided to phase out existing reactors. 
But as worries about the risks of global warming began to get the attention of policy makers, the nuclear industry offered itself as a solution. As early as 1980, industry officials promoted atomic energy as a way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from coal and oil plants. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade group, whose slogan since 2000 has been "Clean Air Energy," hired the Hill & Knowlton public-relations firm in 2006 to create the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition. And it hired Patrick Moore, the co-founder of Greenpeace, and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman as co-chairpersons to push nuclear's green benefits. 
Key environmentalists began speaking out in favor of nuclear power as a way to address climate change, including James Lovelock, a British scientist who developed the Gaia hypothesis that sees the Earth as a self-regulating organism; the late Hugh Montefiore, a former Anglican bishop and a trustee of the U.K. Friends of the Earth; and Stephen Tindale, a former executive director of Greenpeace U.K. 
Most were driven by what they saw as the potentially catastrophic effects of global warming. In comparison, they viewed the risks of nuclear power as more manageable. 
"If you're an environmentalist and you're arguing that catastrophic climate change is a serious problem that we have to deal with, it's increasingly hard to say that we're worried about nuclear power because of what's going to happen to nuclear waste buried inside of a mountain for 10,000 years," says Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland, Calif., think tank. 
Still, not all environmentalists are sold on nuclear, and most environmental groups remain opposed. For one thing, they warn that an ambitious nuclear-building program would squeeze out investments in other alternatives. Further, they say, the lengthy process of building and permitting a nuclear plant means the climate-change benefits aren't going to show up anytime soon, while efficiency programs, investments in solar and wind and even new natural-gas plants could meet low-carbon power needs much sooner. 
For now, though, nuclear power's future isn't going to depend on how many environmentalists see the nuclear light. Instead, it's going to rise and fall on something more basic: economics. Loan guarantees may help a few new plants get built, but even if a tax or a cap-and-trade system puts a price on carbon emissions, nuclear power is still going to be hard-pressed to compete with coal or natural gas in today's power market without more government support. 
This is leading some supporters of nuclear power to place their bets on the next generation of smaller, modular reactors being developed around the world. Some could be built in a factory and installed on site, significantly reducing the time and money involved in building a reactor from the ground up. They also are simpler, and therefore theoretically safer, because they don't require the complex cooling systems of bigger reactors. And while they aren't expected to come online anytime soon, these smaller reactors could eventually be used to power manufacturing plants and generate electricity. 
"I'm much more optimistic about these next-generation designs," Mr. Nordhaus says. "If we're going to get serious about a new nuclear strategy, it's going to be with these smaller nuclear designs."

Abstract 
[...] Mr. Obama directed the Treasury Department not to oppose the loan but to abstain when it was voted on by World Bank directors -- a decision that effectively guaranteed the loan's approval. 

Full Text 
President Obama shocked many supporters last month by proposing to expand offshore oil and gas exploration along the U.S. East Coast. The obvious explanation among outraged environmentalists was that the White House was playing politics with ecologically fragile coastlines. But this particular initiative had more to do with technological and economic realism than partisan maneuvering. 
Mr. Obama indicated as much when he presented his offshore drilling plan. "Given our energy needs," he noted, "we are going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable, homegrown energy." This is a polite way of stating an inescapable fact: As much as the United States or any other nation might aspire to energy independence and a carbon-free future, none of us can end our addiction to fossil fuels any time soon. That's because no green-energy technology is remotely ready to shoulder more than a tiny fraction of the burden currently borne by oil and coal. 
It took courage for Mr. Obama to acknowledge this unpopular truth. In the near term at least, we have no choice but to continue using fossil fuels. Ending our reliance on them instead requires a serious commitment to achieving breakthroughs in green energy technology. Ironically, Mr. Obama's drilling proposal offers a great opportunity to do just that. Offshore production could generate an estimated $165 billion or more in federal royalties-- money that could and should be spent on green energy research and development. 
The energy challenge for Mr. Obama is not just at home. An ugly international confrontation came to a head last week when rich nations faced off against poor ones in an argument over which problem deserved priority: global warming or poverty? 
At issue was a plan by South Africa's energy utility Eskom to build a 4,800-megawatt coal-fired power station in the northern town of Medupi. The plant would be one of the largest power stations of its kind in the world -- and would throw off an estimated 25 million tons of carbon-dioxide each year. But it is needed to relieve a shortage of generating capacity that threatens to undermine the economic growth of South Africa and its neighbors. As South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan noted recently, "To sustain the growth rates we need to create jobs, we have no choice but to build new generating capacity -- relying on what, for now, remains our most abundant and affordable energy source: coal." 
To help finance the power station's construction, South Africa asked the World Bank for a $3.75 billion loan. Normally, such a loan would be quickly approved -- although South Africa is poor by Western standards, its economy is relatively well-managed. But the request provoked vociferous opposition from some developed countries that didn't want the World Bank to support projects that may contribute to global warming. 
In the U.S., three influential members of Congress -- Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.) and Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) linked continued U.S. financial support of the World Bank to the bank's adoption of lending policies reflecting what they called "21st-century priorities." While Africa's energy needs were certainly "urgent," they wrote in a letter to World Bank President Robert Zoellick, "we cannot ignore the reality that our planet is hurtling toward potentially catastrophic climate change." 
In the end, Mr. Obama directed the Treasury Department not to oppose the loan but to abstain when it was voted on by World Bank directors -- a decision that effectively guaranteed the loan's approval. As with Mr. Obama's offshore drilling plan, the Medupi decision exhibited common sense. Stopping the Medupi project would have shown that developed nations put more emphasis on discouraging use of fossil fuels than on developing affordable alternatives. This is an ineffectual response to global warming, and, in condemning tens of millions of Africans to continued poverty, downright immoral. 
We can't expect South Africa or any other nation to stop using coal or oil unless we can find practical, affordable alternatives. For example, if we had solar panels that could produce electricity more cheaply than fossil fuels, then of course South Africa would switch. But we need to develop green technology before we can ask any leaders to consign their people to poverty for the sake of the climate. 
Moral posturing about global warming is easy, and it feels good. Actually doing something to solve the problem -- like committing serious amounts of money to green energy research and development -- will take real effort and sacrifice.

Abstract 
[...] we didn't do much about it. [...] 1970, most regulation of industry was done by the states, which competed so strongly for plants and jobs that regulating companies to protect public health was beyond them. 

Full Text 
In the 1960s, it all seemed so simple. 
We humans with our big cars and our big factories and our big cities were discharging terrible stuff into the air and water, and it had to be stopped or we would soon make our nest uninhabitable. The public was growing increasingly outraged. Every night on color television, we saw yellow sludge flowing into blue rivers; every day as we drove to work, we saw black smudges against the barely visible blue sky. We knew that our indiscriminate use of pesticides and toxic substances was threatening wildlife and public health. 
But we didn't do much about it. Until 1970, most regulation of industry was done by the states, which competed so strongly for plants and jobs that regulating companies to protect public health was beyond them. 
Environmentally, it was a race to the bottom. 
Until, that is, the public had enough and demanded action. A seminal moment: the first Earth Day, on April 22, 1970, when cars were buried and action was demanded from the Nixon administration and Congress. 
And they both acted. President Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, and Congress, starting with the Council on Environmental Quality, passed a cascade of laws designed to clean up our act. 
One of my first public actions as the first head of the EPA was to bring major enforcement actions against three large cities for violations of the Clean Water Act. We followed that with additional action against the steel industry and other industrial polluters. I knew that the job of the EPA would be far more contentious in the future if we didn't establish its credibility and its willingness to take forceful -- and symbolic -- action right from the start. The American people had to know we were serious about meeting their demands. 
Fast forward to 2010. In so many ways, the problems of the 1970s seem almost quaint now -- simpler problems of a simpler time. Our biggest challenge now is to make sure we don't succumb to our inevitable tendency to fight the last war. Or to put it more bluntly: Yesterday's solutions worked well on yesterday's problems, but the solutions we devised back in the 1970s aren't likely to make much of a dent in the environmental problems we face today. 
Don't get me wrong: Considerable progress has been made thanks to those early laws. Air pollution, particularly of the kinds listed in the Clean Air Act of 1970, has been driven to much lower concentrations, and public health and the environment have benefited greatly. 
Similarly, under the Clean Water Act, river basins and watersheds have been cleaned up all over the country. Back in the 1960s, Lake Erie was declared dead; it now supports a fishery of several hundred million dollars a year. The same can be said for many gross pollution problems -- the smell, touch and feel kind. How quickly we forget what the world was like in the 1940s and '50s when most everyone burned soft coal in their furnaces to stay warm during the winter, putting an intolerable burden on our lungs and respiratory system. 
The tactics of the 1970s show what we can accomplish if we put our minds to the task. But today's tasks require more than putting our minds to them. They require a new mind-set. 
To understand why, remember that most of the laws we put in place back then were based on the belief that the fundamental problem was the weakness of state regulatory programs. If we just centralized the regulation of industry at the federal level, there would be no place for the polluters to hide. 
The current generation of problems that we are facing, though, is much more subtle, much less visible to the naked eye -- and often not nearly as susceptible to a top-down, command-and-control approach. 
The rise of climate change as a major national and global problem offers a vivid example. Climate change is difficult to deal with politically because the people who benefit (future generations) are not the same as those who pay (the current generation). That is, our children and grandchildren will reap the gains of any costs that we bear in reducing our current use of carbon. 
On these kinds of issues where the payer and beneficiary are not the same, the American people are ideological liberals and operational conservatives. They are all for the promised results; they just don't want to pay for them. Little wonder that most people will tell their pollsters they are in favor of reducing the impact of our current lifestyle on future generations, but their scant support for policies that will accomplish that belie their commitment. 
I believe that if we are going to address climate change successfully, the top-down, standard-setting enforcement process of the 1970s has to be rethought. It worked just fine when the goal was clear: cutting the amount of specific pollutants from a finite number of industrial and municipal entities. But climate change -- which involves the behavior of all of us who heat our homes and drive our cars, not just business and industry -- is too big and too complicated for something as blunt as this approach. 
Instead, I believe we are going to have to make the substances that cause the problem (for example, carbon or methane) cost more. In other words, if you want people to use less of something, tax it, and then give society flexibility in achieving the desired reductions. If we ever get serious about climate change, that's what we will do. 
Let me offer another example of how the environmental fight has to change tactics. In 1970, when the EPA was first started, the estimate of its water-quality office was that 85% of the problems of water pollution in the country were large point-source discharges, like municipal sewage-treatment plants or industrial operations. Only 15% were non-point sources -- the runoff from city streets, suburban lawns, and rural and farm areas. 
Over the course of the past four decades, we have largely brought the point-source pollution problem under control by instituting a national permit program that spells out for each discharger, whether industrial or municipal, precisely what they are allowed to put into waterways, and in the event they do not live up to those permit requirements, enforcement action is likely to follow. 
By the same token, we have made little or no progress on non-point-source pollution. In fact, the EPA's latest estimate is that the percentage impact on receiving waters is just the reverse of that in 1970: 15% of the problem is point sources, and 85% of the impact is non-point sources. 
The problem is that instituting a top-down solution for this kind of pollution is a lot more difficult than passing laws that target big industrial or municipal offenders. It turns out that while people will support such rules in the abstract, they aren't nearly as eager when it comes to allowing inspectors on their land to tell them how they should manage, say, storm-water runoffs. What's more, in practical terms, it's simply impossible to regulate and monitor everyone who owns property in these areas, as opposed to the comparatively small number of industrial plants and sewage facilities. 
The result has been to frustrate efforts to clean up places like the Chesapeake Bay or the Great Lakes. These efforts have floundered on the shoals of landowner intractability in the face of regulatory mandates. Often the people who support the controls in the abstract and those who resist in the particular are one and the same. 
Even when legislators or local governments mandate certain land-use practices, they will not appropriate money to hire inspectors to enforce them, or local courts will not back up the full reach of land-use restrictions. Our lawmakers and courts are simply reflecting the public's ideological/operational disconnect by their actions. (After all, that is what elected officials who want to stay elected do.) 
So what does this all mean for 2010? What does it mean for protecting the environment 40 years after that first Earth Day and nearly 40 years after the EPA first opened its doors? 
I am convinced that when we put our creative minds to it, we are perfectly capable of harmonizing human prosperity and growth with environmental protection. But putting our mind to some of the more intractable modern problems like climate change and non-point-source pollution is indeed quite a task. It will take a level of public understanding and knowledge of the relationship between the way we live and what we are doing to our natural systems, coupled with a sense of responsibility for the stewardship of our planet, that does not currently exist. 
My own experience in a variety of posts over the past 40 years leads me to certain conclusions. 
First is that people affected by change have to be deeply involved in the crafting of solutions -- they are going to pay for them either economically or through changes in how they live. We need more democracy, not less. Trying to enact rules centrally to control the behavior of hundreds, sometimes thousands of people in a watershed when their individual contribution is minuscule, but collectively overwhelming, is futile. We have been trying a command-and-control, top-down approach for the past four decades to control non-point sources of water pollution. The examples of the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound are grim testimony to our failure. If one solution doesn't work, the answer is not to push it harder but to look for new approaches. 
Second, we have to get better at both involving people in the process of change and providing them with enough information to make that involvement useful and worthwhile. My experience recently helping with salmon recovery efforts in Puget Sound tells me that when people understand their self-interest in solving a problem, they are more than willing to agree to the trade-offs necessary to come to a solution. 
Third, we need uniformly supported science and technical support to inform the discretion of the "deeply involved" people if they are going to come up with sustainable solutions. Dueling scientists make for confused participants in the decision-making process and the subsequent lawsuits lead to expensive and time-consuming nonsolutions. Yes, scientists often disagree, but if the parties affected take an adversarial position to one another at the outset, then scientific disagreement is inevitable. If all interested parties are working together and can agree on a scientist or group of scientists as they start their efforts to fashion a solution, they can avoid the court-inspired dueling-scientist phenomenon. 
Fortunately, we have some examples in the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound where all the interests affected by the needed changes have been invited to the table, and challenged by the government or themselves to put their positions in their pocket and their interests on the table. What people often find is that their interests can be harmonized, and we can have prosperous farms and healthy fish, safe drinking water and sustainable development, and so forth. 
These citizen collaborations have to be carefully structured, stimulated and led by leaders in the government or private sector, facilitated by trained professionals, and end with an outcome of clear goals and objectives. 
This is hard work: It takes time, effort and skills not often enjoyed by governments. But the payoffs from avoiding delays -- and the economic and environmental costs that come with those delays -- are well worth it. 
If there is any overriding lesson we should learn from the progress we made over the past 40 years, it is this: We have always shown our ability to adapt to meet new and complex challenges, as long as we are given the chance to go to work on them.

Abstract 
While markets are certain to dip after any terrorist attack, certain individual stocks may go up, much in the way bomb-detection company Invision went from $3 in 2001 to being acquired by General Electric Co. for $50 a few years later as a result of a new urgency after Sept. 11 to detect bombs at airports. Analogic Corp., which provides X-ray scanning at airports that allows security to peer inside your locked, checked baggage, and Nice-Systems Ltd., which makes software that looks for suspicious activity on security cameras or even in cash transactions at banks. 

Full Text 
It seems every week there is a new world-ending threat making its way through the media and investors' stock portfolios. In February, it was the fear that every nation was going to go bankrupt, starting with Greece. Before that, it was the latest pandemic making waves at the World Health Organization. Other times it has been global warming, or terrorism, or impending hyperinflation. 
While some investors consider short-selling the most effective hedge against potential threats, I believe the best way to guard against each of these fears is to insulate your portfolio with stocks that have the tendency to go up when that particular fear rears its ugly head. The truth is, it's very difficult to make money with short-selling, even in bear markets. 
As an example, during the dot-com implosion in 2001, with the Nasdaq Composite Index down 20%, the nation gripped by recession and domestic terrorism on the minds of many, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Dedicated Short Bias Index (made up of hedge funds specializing in short-selling) actually fell 3% on the year. Value stocks and stocks related to terrorism, however, ended the year in positive territory. 
With that in mind, here is a closer look at several potential threats and the stocks I think could help investors ride out that particular storm: 
Hurricanes 
I looked at the top 10 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history and determined there were three stocks that consistently moved higher after each of the storms. They were Campbell Soup Co., as people stocked up on canned goods in anticipation of not being able to get groceries; Nucor Corp., which makes the steel used in repairing bridges or buildings; and Hill-Rom Holdings Inc., which, among other things, makes hospital beds and medical equipment. 
No More Clean Water 
Perhaps the greatest threat to the world is the possibility of running out of clean water. Right now, one out of every two hospital beds in the world is occupied by someone suffering from a water-borne illness. As this becomes an increasingly serious problem -- since 1950, the world population has doubled but consumption of water has tripled -­two companies worth researching are Flowserve Corp., which makes pipes, pumps and other equipment for water-treatment facilities, and Tetra Tech Inc., which designs water-treatment facilities. 
Terrorism 
Sadly, the threat of terrorism may be here to stay. While markets are certain to dip after any terrorist attack, certain individual stocks may go up, much in the way bomb-detection company Invision went from $3 in 2001 to being acquired by General Electric Co. for $50 a few years later as a result of a new urgency after Sept. 11 to detect bombs at airports. Two companies to consider: Analogic Corp., which provides X-ray scanning at airports that allows security to peer inside your locked, checked baggage, and Nice-Systems Ltd., which makes software that looks for suspicious activity on security cameras or even in cash transactions at banks. 
Pandemics 
A few years ago, it was avian flu making headlines. This past year it was swine flu that had people in a panic. Every year the flu mutates, grows stronger and evades the vaccines that were developed the year before to vanquish it. 
In the event a more serious pandemic takes hold -- and some experts predict it is only a matter of time -- the following stocks could bolster your portfolio. GlaxoSmithKline PLC, with $20 billion in sales, is the largest maker of flu vaccines and a holding of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Another Buffett holding, Sanofi-Aventis, also is heavily involved in the development of vaccines. (It is no surprise that he is loading up on health-care stocks in the face of an aging baby-boomer population). 
For a speculative pick, Alpha Pro Tech Ltd. is interesting. It doesn't need U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for what it does. The company makes the masks you see people wearing on the street whenever there is a flu scare. And with 63% year-over-year growth, that scare has turned into real revenue. 
Global Warming 
The global-warming fear is a multibillion-dollar industry that has captivated imaginations and anxieties world-wide. To hedge against the risk that the global-warming threat is real, I suggest looking into nuclear-power-related stocks. Nuclear power has no emissions and is cheaper per watt than solar, wind, coal and natural gas. There have been zero deaths from nuclear accidents in the U.S., and President Obama has just requested $54 billion in funding to help build new nuclear plants. The leader in producing refinery-grade uranium is Cameco Corp., accounting for 19% of the world's production. 
Hyperinflation 
Not quite a world-ending threat, but the thought of the dollar going to zero due to massive stimulus packages certainly has pundits in a tizzy every time the deficit is mentioned. Forget about gold, which is only used as a hedge against inflation. Consider silver, which in addition to being a precious metal like gold, also is an industrial metal with uses ranging from semiconductors to surgical equipment to dental care. 
Because of its industrial uses, silver will go up in a booming economy, too. And finally, consider the SPDR S&P 500, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 index. More than 40% of the S&P 500 revenues come from abroad and would benefit from a weaker dollar. The stock market could be the best hedge against inflation.

Abstract 
What's really holding the city hostage is the state's global warming law and the mayor's green energy agenda, which includes boosting renewables to 40% of the city's energy portfolio by 2020. 

Full Text 
In Los Angeles's latest soap opera, city controller Wendy Greuel has declared an "urgent financial crisis." Get used to hearing those words a lot across the urban landscape. 
Ms. Greuel warned that next month L.A. could run out of money if the city's Department of Water and Power doesn't make good on its promise to pay the city $73.5 million. If that happens, the city may have to start depleting its emergency reserve fund, which could hurt its credit rating and make it more difficult to borrow to pay future bills. Due to the city's bleeding finances, Moody's earlier this week downgraded the city's general obligation bond rating to Aa2 from Aa3. 
What's brought the famed city to this pass? Global warming, of course. Or more precisely, the crusade against global warming. 
A couple of months ago, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa proposed electricity rate hikes of 9% to 28% to wean the city off coal and pay for its aggressive renewable energy portfolio. Residents and businesses bristled at such a steep increase in their electric bills, especially during a recession. Facing irate constituents, the city council nixed the utility's proposed 5.7% three-month rate hike, the first of four increases planned. 
This in turn prompted the utility to withhold $73.5 million of the $220.5 million surplus revenue it was expected to transfer to the city. Without the rate hike, the utility's interim manager S. David Freeman says it doesn't have enough money to pay its own bills and hand the city the $73.5 million. The city council complains that the utility is holding the city hostage. 
What's really holding the city hostage is the state's global warming law and the mayor's green energy agenda, which includes boosting renewables to 40% of the city's energy portfolio by 2020. The state's renewable goal is 33%. The mayor says the city could face hundreds of millions of dollars in fines if it doesn't comply with the state's numerous renewable energy and carbon reduction mandates. But of course complying with these mandates means a sharp increase in energy prices, as Los Angeles residents are now discovering. 
L.A.'s predicament is merely a preview of what municipalities across California have to look forward to as the state's renewable energy mandates begin to bite. It's also a cautionary tale for states that want to emulate California's global warming law. Little wonder a popular revolt is building against the state's carbon dictates. A repeal referendum may make it on the ballot in November.

Abstract 
[...] to come are major plants under construction by Duke Energy Corp., American Electric Power Co. and Dominion Resources Inc. However, development of additional units faces serious threats from natural gas, which is being touted by many as the preferred fuel for power plants amid a surge in supply and lower emissions, expected stricter regulations on mercury and other air pollutants, and federal action on climate change. 

Full Text 
Nearly two-dozen coal-fired power plants are scheduled to start up in the next three years, but plans for new projects have all but dried up amid falling power demand and efforts to limit carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Last year brought the largest annual addition of coal-fired generation in nearly two decades as projects planned several years ago were finished. Still to come are major plants under construction by Duke Energy Corp., American Electric Power Co. and Dominion Resources Inc. 
However, development of additional units faces serious threats from natural gas, which is being touted by many as the preferred fuel for power plants amid a surge in supply and lower emissions, expected stricter regulations on mercury and other air pollutants, and federal action on climate change. 
Looking ahead, "you're only building one kind of [central station] power plant, and that's natural gas," said Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners, a Washington consulting firm. 
The Sierra Club environmental group says developers haven't broken ground on a new unit in more than a year, and the list of canceled plants continues to grow. The Blackstone Group LP's Sithe Global Power is the latest, announcing last week the cancellation of a coal-fired plant under development in Nevada in favor of a natural-gas generation facility. 
The near-term challenge for all plant construction is electricity demand, which fell 5% in the last two years. Power use is beginning to recover, but is climbing back from sales levels not seen since 2004. 
Many of the coal projects under construction were planned before the recession hit and demand dropped. The National Energy Technology Laboratory, or NETL, in a presentation this year listed 22 coal-fired plants under construction in the U.S. The plants will provide nearly 14,000 megawatts of generating capacity, or enough electricity to power 10 million or more homes. Some of the new plants under development will replace older coal-fired ones scheduled for retirement, and further plant closures are expected as the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency puts in place anticipated stricter rules for mercury, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants. 
Federal regulations on heat-trapping, greenhouse gases linked to climate change loom large over plant development, especially as units built today will be spinning for decades to come. Burning coal is the most carbon intensive way to generate electricity, and the eight plants completed last year in the U.S. would emit an estimated 170 tons of CO2 a day, according to NETL capacity estimates and EPA average emission rates. 
Proposed federal limits on CO2 have stalled in the U.S. Senate, but the EPA is moving forward on regulations under the Clean Air Act. The rules would hit new plant proposals first starting in January, with the EPA requiring proposed units to be permitted to emit CO2. 
The process is still being developed, but environmental and industry officials say a new coal-fired unit would be required to install the best available technologies to control CO2 emissions. 
Where the issue becomes complex is, what is meant by technologies? 
While coal units can become more efficient, there isn't a commercially available technology to make major cuts in their CO2 emissions. 
Several sectors of the energy industry, state regulators, the EPA and environmental groups are in a heated debate about what should be considered the best technology to reduce emissions. The questions include: Should coal plants instead run on natural gas? Should they be required to capture CO2 and store it underground? That option presents its own challenges. 
Many involved in the debate want Congress to step in and write new regulations instead. 
"This is the biggest challenge I have ever seen in any industry," said Theresa Pugh, director of environmental services for the American Public Power Association, a trade group for community-owned electric utilities.

UNITED KINGDOM Conservatives Propose Changes to Energy Tax The U.K.'s Conservative Party proposed reforming an existing energy tax so it would act as a floor price for carbon and support the development of low-carbon electricity 
generation such as nuclear power and offshore wind. 
The Conservatives, who are leading in opinion polls ahead of a general election expected in May, revealed the plans in an energy-policy paper. It proposes changing the current 
climate-change levy, which is designed to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, to a system based on the carbon content of electricity when it is generated. 
The move is important for energy companies seeking to invest billions of pounds in new nuclear-power stations to replace the country's aging fleet of reactors and retiring coal 

plants. They have long called for a mechanism to support the development of costly nuclear power, saying the current carbon price of around 13 euros ($17.59) a metric ton is 

about 35 euros too low to stimulate investment. 
"British energy policy is out of date," Conservative Party leader David Cameron said. "It was designed almost 30 years ago for a world in which Britain had an excess of 
generating capacity, in which we enjoyed the benefits of growing North Sea oil and gas production and in which neither local pollution nor climate change were the concerns 
they are today." 

-- Selina Williams Son Who Aided Suicide Won't Be Charged British prosecutors said they won't charge the son of conductor Edward Downes and his wife with assisting the couple's suicides at a Swiss clinic called Dignitas last year. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said it wasn't in the public interest to prosecute Caractacus Downes, who traveled to Zurich with his parents and booked them a 
hotel room. The July deaths of 85-year-old Edward Downes, one of Britain's most eminent conductors and former maestro of the BBC Philharmonic, and his 74-year-old wife 
Joan spurred debate about assisted suicide, which is illegal in Britain. 
Under British law, assisting a suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in prison, but courts have become reluctant to convict those who help ailing loved ones end their lives. 
More than 100 Britons have died in Dignitas clinics since 1998, and no relative or friend has been charged. 

Last month, Mr. Starmer clarified the legal guidelines, saying each case would be considered individually and criminal charges would be less likely when assisting a suicide was 
motivated solely by compassion.

INDIA Hijacking Laws Changed To Include Death Penalty India's cabinet approved changes to antihijacking laws, allowing the country's air force to force hijacked planes to land and making hijacking a crime that carries the death 
penalty. The move by the Congress party-led government will make antihijacking laws in India tougher by strengthening the Anti-Hijacking Act of 1982. 
Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the cabinet had cleared the proposals to amend the existing antihijacking law. The proposed amendments are likely to be presented in 
parliament when the lower house reconvenes after its recess next month. 
If the amendments are passed, hijackers could receive the death penalty, life imprisonment as well as a fine, according to a person from the prime minister's office. 

The amendments would also permit the Indian air force to dispatch fighters to stop any hijacked plane from taking off from Indian soil. The air force would also be allowed to force hijacked planes to land if they are in Indian airspace. 
The cabinet also approved adding a clause covering conspiracy to hijack an aircraft. Conspiracy to hijack an aircraft wasn't a provision in the original law. If approved, any aider and abettor of a hijacking could be given the death penalty as well.

IRAQ Soccer Suspension Lifted The world's soccer governing body lifted a suspension on Asian champion Iraq, as FIFA President Sepp Blatter said after an executive meeting that "Iraq is fully back as a 
member, they have a road map to [federation] elections and they can play football again." 
Iraq was banned in November for the second time in 18 months after the country's Olympic committee disbanded their soccer association and government security forces seized control of the federation headquarters. The ban came only four months after Iraq staged their first international matches at home since the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. Iraq captured the world's 
imagination by winning the Asian Cup in 2007, but the team has struggled since. -- Reuters

Abstract 
Peabody Energy Co., one of the country's major coal producers, filed a petition last month with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's move to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions because it relies on IPCC determinations. 

Full Text 
The United Nations detailed its plans for an outside review of its beleaguered panel on climate change, amid political reverberations as critics and advocates each jockeyed to use the announcement to their advantage. 
The InterAcademy Council, a body representing scientific academies around the world, is to conduct a wide-ranging review of the procedures and management of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The review, to be done by August, comes in response to revelations of questionable behavior and factual errors by some scientists who contributed to the IPCC's 2007 report, which won a Nobel Peace Prize. 
The report called climate change "unequivocal" and "very likely" caused by emissions from human activity. 
Robbert Dijkgraaf, co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, said in an interview that a particularly delicate task will be to pick who participates in the review. The council needs people who have knowledge of climate science but aren't too close to the IPCC: "Clearly you cannot be the reviewer and the reviewed at the same time," he said. But people involved in previous IPCC reports could serve on the review committee, he said. 
The council was set up in 2000 to advise international institutions such as the U.N. and the World Bank. The IPCC chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, participated in a previous council report on energy issues, but Mr. Dijkgraaf said that wouldn't compromise the council's objectivity. 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made climate change one of the top priorities of his tenure. Mr. Ban took no questions Wednesday and didn't directly address trhe future of Mr. Pachauri, who has faced calls to resign. But the two stood together at the U.N. podium and Mr. Ban was supportive. 
"Regrettably, there were a very small number of errors" in the panel's 2007 report, Mr. Ban said. "Remember, this is a 3,000-page synthesis of complex scientific data. I have seen no credible evidence that challenges the main conclusions of that report." In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Pachauri said he would "certainly not" resign. 
Critics of proposed greenhouse-gas regulations in the U.S. have begun using questions about the IPCC as their latest ammunition. Peabody Energy Co., one of the country's major coal producers, filed a petition last month with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's move to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions because it relies on IPCC determinations. 
The EPA said in a statement that it is confident its move will withstand legal challenge. "The question of the science is settled," the agency said. 
The IPCC expressed "regret" earlier this year that its 2007 report erroneously claimed that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. The report also said inaccurately that about half of the Netherlands sits below sea level. IPCC leaders, including Mr. Pachauri, say an independent review is needed to try to restore public confidence in the panel. 
The InterAcademy Council's board is likely to elect members to its review committee on March 22, Mr. Dijkgraaf said. He said the committee probably will include some people who have little exposure to climate science, but have expertise in issues such as quality control of data and use of non-peer-reviewed literature. The report will go through the council's board, which consists largely of presidents of national science academies. 
"Scientific reputations will rest on this, and if it can be shown the science was sloppy, their stars will fall," said scientific ethicist Thomas M. Powers, director of the Science, Ethics, and Public Policy Program at the University of Delaware, speaking of those involved in the IPCC report. "Apart from divining rods, the best we can do is get the smartest people in the world, the people who know science, and ask them to review their peers." 
Environmentalists said that they hoped the review would quiet criticism of the IPCC. It should "restore public confidence that has been shaken by an aggressive campaign to sow confusion about climate science," said a statement by Peter Frumhoff, who helped to write the 2007 report and is director of science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, who is among those calling for Mr. Pachauri's resignation, on Wednesday said that the U.S. "cannot afford to continue to base our energy and environmental policies on contaminated U.N. data." 
The InterAcademy Council will probe, among other things, the IPCC's guidelines for using non-peer-reviewed literature in its reports, how to ensure the IPCC considers a "full range of scientific views," and how it corrects any errors in its reports once detected, Mr. Dijkgraaf said, The council also will "look at the management of the IPCC," he said. 
Neither the U.N. nor the IPCC will "exercise any control" over the study by the InterAcademy Council, Mr. Dijkgraaf said.

Abstract 
How to pay for the dissolution of a failing financial company is a problem that has vexed policy makers since 2008, when government officials scrambled to deal with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of American International Group Inc. The government doesn't have the power to seize failing financial companies except for banks, and Messrs. Dodd and Corker are working on a mechanism to change that.

OHIO Two Dead in Shooting Involving School Janitor An Ohio State University janitor who was about to lose his job walked into a maintenance building for his early morning shift Tuesday and shot two supervisors, killing one of 
them and fatally shooting himself. No students were hurt. 
Nathaniel Brown, 51 years old, arrived for work at the nation's largest university dressed in dark clothing, a hooded sweatshirt and a backpack. He then opened fire in an office 
suite using two handguns, campus Police Chief Paul Denton said. 
Mr. Brown spent five years in prison in the 1970s and '80s for receiving stolen property but lied about it on his job application, records show. Ohio State released documents 

from Mr. Brown's personnel file showing that supervisors complained he was tardy, slept on the job and had problems following instructions. The university sent him a letter 

March 2 informing him that his employment was to end Saturday. 
The shooting was reported at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday. Police tactical units surrounded the building and found Mr. Brown with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a garage bay, Mr. 
Denton said. Mr. Brown was pronounced dead at a campus hospital several hours later.

WASHINGTON, D.C. Hefty Fees Are Sought From Large Firms Key senators have agreed to levy $50 billion in fees on the U.S.'s largest financial companies to cover the cost of paying the collapse of financial firms, people familiar with the 
matter said. 
The deal is expected to be part of a broader financial regulatory overhaul bill to be released in the next week by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., 
Conn.) and Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.). 
How to pay for the dissolution of a failing financial company is a problem that has vexed policy makers since 2008, when government officials scrambled to deal with the 

bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of American International Group Inc. The government doesn't have the power to seize failing financial companies except for banks, and Messrs. Dodd and Corker are working on a mechanism to change that. One goal of the proposal is to prevent taxpayers from having to pay for the next financial crisis. 
The way the senators plan to finance their proposed fund attempts to address concerns raised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Treasury Department. -- Damian Paletta 
PENNSYLVANIA Woman Charged in Plot To Recruit Jihadists A suburban Philadelphia woman "desperate to do something" to help suffering Muslims has been charged with using the Internet to recruit jihadist fighters and help terrorists 
overseas, even agreeing to move to Europe to try to kill someone, prosecutors said. 
A federal indictment charges that Colleen R. LaRose agreed to kill a Swedish citizen on orders from the unnamed terrorists and traveled to Europe to carry out the killing. It doesn't say whether the Swede was killed, but Ms. LaRose wasn't charged with murder. 
U.S. Attorney Michael Levy said the indictment doesn't link Ms. LaRose, a U.S. citizen who moved to Europe in August 2009, to any organized terror groups. 
Ms. LaRose, 46 years old, has been in custody since Oct. 15.

ENVIRONMENT 
Obama Presses Senators 
To Revive Climate Bill 
President Barack Obama renewed his push to get a climate and energy bill through Congress in the coming weeks, meeting at the White House Tuesday with cabinet officials 

and senior Democratic and Republican senators working on the issue. 
The White House has been trying to revive a stalled effort in the Senate to gather the needed 60 votes for a bill to cut greenhouse-gas emissions across the economy. 
A bill passed last year by the House would achieve that goal by effectively putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions with a "cap and trade" system. The cap and trade 

proposal has divided Congress, and stirred opposition from some business groups that say cap and trade will result in higher energy prices and job losses. 
A White House official described Mr. Obama as expressing strong support in the meeting for "clean energy incentives" that create jobs and reduce dependence on foreign oil. 
The White House and other administration officials have de-emphasized cap and trade and climate change in recent weeks, emphasizing instead their position that federal policy 

to promote alternatives to coal and oil would create jobs.

LOUISIANA Body of Executive Recovered From River A body recovered from the Mississippi River Tuesday in New Orleans has been identified as that of a missing executive of AGL Resources Inc. A relative identified the body of 54-year-old Douglas Schantz, said a spokesman for the New Orleans/Orleans Parish coroner's office. The recovery largely brings to a close the mystery surrounding Mr. Schantz, who disappeared early Friday morning. New Orleans police no longer suspect foul play. Police surveillance cameras reviewed late Monday showed Mr. Schantz walking in a restricted area near the Steamboat Natchez, a dinner cruise boat that is docked in the French 
Quarter. When asked about Mr. Schantz's physical state in the video, Mr. Defillo said: "He had been drinking and I'll leave it at that." -- Susan Daker 
NEW YORK Successor to Head Of Police to Retire The successor to the New York State Police superintendent who retired amid the scandal enveloping Gov. David Paterson is himself retiring after only a week on the new job. Acting Superintendent Pedro Perez is stepping down after 28 years, following former Superintendent Harry Corbitt out the door. He automatically succeeded Mr. Corbitt and said 
his presence was an obstacle to change. 
Mr. Perez said Tuesday that his departure had nothing to do with the New York state attorney general's investigation into whether state troopers and Mr. Paterson made improper contact with a woman who had accused an aide of abuse. Police Field Commander John Melville will take over as acting superintendent Friday. -- Associated Press 
NEW YORK Fixing a Fiscal Crisis Lawmakers in closed-door budget talks at the Capitol on Tuesday discussed a spending cap, more borrowing and proposed creation of an independent control board. Gov. David Paterson said the independent board proposed by Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch would decide whether a budget deal struck by the legislature and governor is balanced. If 
not, the governor -- or potentially another official such as the comptroller -- would gain powers to make final spending cuts. -- Associated Pres NEW JERSEY 
Plea in Airport Breach 
A student from China pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in an airport security breach that led to world-wide flight delays. Haisong Jiang will pay a $500 fine and perform 100 hours of community service. He was arrested Jan. 8, days after authorities said he entered a restricted area to say goodbye to his girlfriend at Newark Liberty International.

Abstract 
Other business leaders are pushing the White House to revive the climate issue, despite waning support, saying Congress's failure to act on energy policy is hobbling U.S. industry's efforts to compete with China and Europe in developing clean energy technology. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama renewed his push to get a climate and energy bill through Congress in the coming weeks, meeting at the White House Tuesday with cabinet officials and senior Democratic and Republican senators working on the issue. 
The White House has been trying to revive a stalled effort in the Senate to gather the needed 60 votes for a bill to cut greenhouse-gas emissions across the economy. 
A bill passed last year by the House would achieve that goal by effectively putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions with a "cap and trade" system. The cap and trade proposal has divided Congress, and stirred opposition from some business groups that say cap and trade will result in higher energy prices and job losses. 
Other business leaders are pushing the White House to revive the climate issue, despite waning support, saying Congress's failure to act on energy policy is hobbling U.S. industry's efforts to compete with China and Europe in developing clean energy technology. 
A White House official described Mr. Obama as expressing strong support in the meeting for "clean energy incentives" that create jobs and reduce dependence on foreign oil. The White House and other administration officials have de-emphasized cap and trade and climate change in recent weeks, emphasizing instead their position that federal policy to promote alternatives to coal and oil would create jobs. 
The administration is battling the GOP and some Democrats over its plan to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, using the Environmental Protection Agency's rule-making power. Many lawmakers want to suspend or halt the administration's plans to have the EPA regulate greenhouse gases. 
The administration hasn't offered its own proposal for a climate or energy bill. Instead, the White House is trying to broker a compromise between centrist Democrats and a number of Republicans who have expressed some measure of support for action on greenhouse gases. Leading the efforts in the Senate are Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.), Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Joe Lieberman (I., Conn.). 
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, several senators said the meeting didn't forge consensus on a path forward on climate legislation. 
"It wasn't a discussion of specifics for a bill; rather, it was a discussion to talk about different approaches," said Sen. Susan Collins, (R., Maine). 
Mr. Kerry said the Senate trio would work on "specific language that we've negotiated with various interested parties." 
This may be one of the president's last chances to try to form consensus on a climate bill. Among other things, gasoline prices are expected to rise ahead of the summer driving season, reminding voters of the potential cost of a climate bill, while the ailing economy remains at the top of their concerns. 
The White House is offering a number of bargaining chips in its effort to win support. Last month, Mr. Obama proposed tripling funding to guarantee loans to the nuclear industry. The administration also has a bargaining chip in its power to open -- or keep closed -- new areas on the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and natural-gas exploration by energy companies.

Abstract 
Peter Voser, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, is navigating the situation by joining a business-backed effort to push for global-warming laws, and making sure Shell has a strong exposure to natural gas and alternative fuels. Mr. Voser sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Alan Murray and Kimberley Strassel to talk about the future of climate-change legislation, the company's push beyond oil, the prospects for electric vehicles and more. 

Full Text 
These days, giant oil companies find themselves trying to balance two big pressures on their business. Governments are trying to slash carbon emissions -- but the world's 
thirst for oil is growing by leaps and bounds. Peter Voser, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, is navigating the situation by joining a business-backed effort to push 
for global-warming laws, and making sure Shell has a strong exposure to natural gas and alternative fuels. 

Mr. Voser sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Alan Murray and Kimberley Strassel to talk about the future of climate-change legislation, the company's push beyond oil, the 
prospects for electric vehicles and more. 

Here are edited excerpts of their discussion. 
ALAN MURRAY: I'd like to start by asking you about U.S. CAP [the U.S. Climate Action Partnership], the business effort to push for global-warming legislation. You are the last oil 
company there. Many of the other majors never joined to begin with. BP joined and then pulled out because it didn't like the direction that it was going in. Why is Shell alone 
among the oil companies in continuing to push for this? 

PETER VOSER: We have a belief that we need a market-based energy legislation in this country. And by the way, in all the other countries as well. We feel that we can do more 
by being inside U.S. CAP together with the other stakeholders represented there in order to actually achieve the right outcome. 

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: What kind of bill could you want or expect that would actually be good for your industry? 
MR. VOSER: What we want is energy legislation that drives supply security in this country, which drives the country to lower fuel emissions, which generates new jobs but also 
preserves old jobs. 

To then go further down, we are a keen proponent of market-based energy legislation. We will quite clearly look out for natural-gas developments, which we see as a long-term 

source of energy that has a lot of positives. 
And in general, I think our industry is facing an interesting challenge that the demand in the world will double, but we have to provide that energy at a much lower cost to the 
environment. This will drive technology developments, innovation developments, etc., and that's normally where our industry has always been in a leading position. And that's 
what we want to see in the legislation so that we have certainty on the carbon price, certainty on, let's say, legislation that will stay for a while so that we can operate. 

MS. STRASSEL: What odds do you give passage of a cap-and-trade bill this year? 

MR. VOSER: I'm still hopeful that we get something passed. I know the timing will be longer than what we expected maybe 12 months ago, but we will do our part in order to 
make sure that we get something that the industry and the country can take forward. But I think we are in for a longer period before we get something. 
MR. MURRAY: We talk about Shell as an oil company, but you're very close to becoming a predominantly natural-gas company, aren't you? 
MR. VOSER: That's absolutely correct. Shell started quite a while back, actually, to put a lot of emphasis on gas. And by 2012, we will have more gas production world-wide 

than we have oil. 

So this has been a journey of 20, 30 years that we have used our technology and innovation in order to drive the gas development on a world-wide basis because, let's face it, it 
has 50%, 70% less CO2 than coal, for example, and that's exactly where we see the long-term benefit. 
MR. MURRAY: And in your view, is that the big answer to our environmental problems for the next 50-plus years? 
MR. VOSER: I don't think there is one answer. 
On a global perspective, the energy demand will double -- this is pretty much proved now -- by 2050. So we will need most of the energy forms that we know today. 
MR. MURRAY: What percentage of your capital spending goes to renewable energy sources, roughly? 
MR. VOSER: It is not the capital intensity that drives renewable energies and alternative energies. It's what you spend in technologies and in innovation. Roughly 25% of our 

budget at this stage goes into what we call alternative energies from an R&D point of view. 

MR. MURRAY: And of the 25% of your R&D budget that you spend on renewables, what in that portfolio do you personally think is the most promising? 
MR. VOSER: We are focusing a lot on biofuels at this stage. We just announced a few weeks ago a big joint venture in Brazil where we are bringing our first- and second-generation biofuels technologies together with Cosan, a sugar ethanol producer there, in order to speed up the second-generation capabilities because we need to speed up that process. So biofuels is one. 
We are in wind. We have gone out of solar. We tried both silicon and thin-film solar, but we can't see that as being something that we can scale up globally and get the economies of scale. So we leave that. It's a technology that will be developed, no doubt, but we leave that to a smaller, medium-sized players. 
MR. MURRAY: For your oil business, transportation is obviously a key to the future. How long do you think it will take for electric cars to become a significant part of the vehicle fleet? 
MR. VOSER: We think between now and 2050 we will go from one billion cars to two billion cars world-wide. So it's quite a growth there. We think by 2050 that roughly 40% of those two billion cars will be electric cars. 
But there is a but to this. Which means in the meantime we will need all [types of environmentally friendly cars]. So we will need low-carbon-fuels cars, more-efficient engines. We will need the hybrids. There will be more electrical cars coming in. There will be fuel cells, there will be hydrogen. So I think there will be room and space to develop all of them. 
MS. STRASSEL: You talked about how you wanted legislation here in the U.S. to help with the certainty. But as a global company you already operate in regions that do have climate restrictions. How has that affected your business? 
MR. VOSER: I would like to have a market-based system that actually works on the global environment. Because the world, the trade flow today, is a global trade flow, so you cannot cut between frontiers, boundaries, countries, etc. 
So while I think it is OK to start country or regionally, we need governments working together, and that's where I think Copenhagen would have been a good way to achieve a global agreement. We didn't get it. I'm not too disappointed because I think this is a journey. We will need more time. 
The politicians or the governments also have to learn to bring some reality into the discussion from time to time. So we get biofuels legislation, for example, and two years later they change because they realize technically it's not possible. I think that's where governments, companies, NGOs can work together to set the right frames. 
MS. STRASSEL: Some people say instead of all the negotiations and the offsets and the carbon trading, just put a carbon tax, in particular a gas tax, and see where that goes. 
MR. VOSER: I would say you need a market-based system where you can actually give the right incentives for those industries that are affected to make sure that they can lower the CO2 over time and they can lower the costs to achieve that over time. You need an incentive there, and I just struggle to see that a tax is an incentive.

Abstract 
[...] the statutory limit of Yucca Mountain would have been used up in the next couple of decades. Is it right to have a comprehensive energy bill when what's needed in the short and long term is a price on carbon? DR. CHU: 

Full Text 
It's fair to say these have been some frustrating months for Steven Chu, secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. Among other things: The global climate summit in Copenhagen failed to produce much of an agreement. The prospects of passing a comprehensive energy bill are murkier than ever. There have been a string of revelations about questionable practices and outright mistakes by scientists who contributed to a big 2007 U.N. climate-science report. And the Obama administration has been criticized for the way it has doled out economic-stimulus funds. 
Mr. Chu talked with Robert Thomson, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. What follows are edited excerpts of that conversation. 
ROBERT THOMSON: You're in the news today in part because of the administration's announcement that it would drop plans for a federal nuclear-waste vault beneath Yucca Mountain in Nevada. As someone who has been an advocate, and many would say a brave advocate, of the advancement of nuclear power, is it a little frustrating for you that this decision was clearly made more for political than scientific reasons? 
STEVEN CHU: Well, it's fair to say that the whole history of Yucca Mountain was more political than scientific. But also very truthfully I can say that given what we know today, the repository looks less and less good. So now we're in a situation where it can't go forward. 
When Yucca Mountain was being established in the early '80s, the idea then was the nuclear industry was going to tail off. Now, because of climate change, we do want to restart the nuclear industry. Because of that, the statutory limit of Yucca Mountain would have been used up in the next couple of decades. So we need to take a fresh look at everything. 
MR. THOMSON: If you are a utility that had invested in the Yucca development on the understanding that it was going to be a government priority, how can you reassure them that nuclear itself will be something worth investing in, because it is a very expensive proposition? 
DR. CHU: It's expensive, but it could still be a very good investment. [In the 1980s, before nuclear construction came to a stop], it took longer and longer to build the plants. The time from your application to the time you actually turned the switch on was in excess of 15 years. If the nuclear industry is going to be viable you just can't do that. At the beginning, it was taking six years, seven years to build a plant. So we want to get back to this time scale. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is changing. They will try to generically approve a reactor like the AP1000 from Westinghouse, and say, OK, all AP1000s are now approved. If you start approving a few generic reactors and then make a very short approval period for reviewing the specific site modifications, that's a very, very different process. 
In addition, the reactors themselves are designed with less elaborate, more passively safe mechanisms, so the designs are becoming more economical. 
We think with these new designs plus the faster process for getting them approved, investing in the industry can be back on track. 
MR. THOMSON: Is it right to have a comprehensive energy bill when what's needed in the short and long term is a price on carbon? 
DR. CHU: I think the price on carbon is the most important part of any comprehensive energy bill. But it's not only the price because to be realistic, the price to build a new coal plant with carbon capture and sequestration is actually quite high. 
What we are doing here in the Department of Energy is a very active research program to demonstrate much more cost-effective technologies to bring that cost down. You also have to give time for certain regions of the country that have been used to inexpensive energy to make adjustments. You have to give them a little stimulus to make them go in that direction, we have to do the research and development to help those industries. It's not just, give them the price signal and then they will make that adjustment. That would be a little bit too painful. 
MR. THOMSON: Is it possible to strip out a carbon bit so that you at least have a paradigm within which companies can begin to plan and leave the very complicated political stuff until later? 
DR. CHU: Well, it turns out in Washington it's easier to get all those carrots, to get funds for research in carbon capture and sequestration, funds to help people make the transition to more fuel-efficient homes and factories. It's much harder to get a universe-wide cap on carbon that ratchets down. 
MR. THOMSON: When would you forecast that bill will be passed? 
DR. CHU: I'm really optimistic. I want it to pass this year. Whether it will be over the entire energy usage or whether it will be divvied up into sectors I don't know. China is moving. They're diversifying their supply. They want to be a leader in this new technology. They think it's going to be good for exports. So it's ours to lose, but we could blow it. 
MR. THOMSON: You mentioned the bumps and warts. That little bit of sloppiness at the IPCC [the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], was that frustrating because it did turn the debate a little bit? 
DR. CHU: Well, it's frustrating, but scientists are human beings, and it doesn't negate the huge amount of data that was going on, and over a two- to three-decade period where it's very, very visible and it gets scrutinized up, down, sideways. 
The wonderful thing about science is scientists themselves love to scrutinize each other, because the scientist who actually figures out that the mainstream is wrong becomes incredibly famous. That's how science progresses. 
MR. THOMSON: You mentioned the stimulus funds. There are two complaints. One is that there is just way too much bureaucracy in the approval process. And secondly, that there's been a lack of ambition in investing or supporting next-generation research. 
DR. CHU: First, there is always government bureaucracy. We are trying our best to cut that down to the bone, but there are statutes. For example, the loans. Why does it take so long to get a loan out? Well, we are required by statute to do certain things. We have to protect the taxpayer interests. We have to make sure when we give a loan that there's a reasonable probability of getting it back. And then there's, effectively, the credit subsidy loan insurance, and then how you score the loan insurance. So we have to do due diligence, and then we have to go and convince the [Office of Management and Budget] that our analysis is correct, and then they have to buy onto it. So that takes a while. 
Now, because of those constraints on our loans, we can't make a lot of loans we'd like to make of more daring stuff. Because in the more daring technologies the probability of failure is higher. So what we argued in the next budget is, increase the credit subsidy for renewables and efficiency and for other more daring things that may or may not work. 
In an ideal world when the capital markets are there, you'd like the commercial people to take this over. But right now, capital is very tight. Look how long it took to make the transition from wood to coal, coal to oil and gas: 50-60 years. We cannot make this transition in another 50 or 60 years. It will be too late for the climate.

Abstract 
The size of the cases and the pounds of pollution reduced aren't the only measure of the enforcement effort. Since taking office, Mr. Obama's administration has promised to take a tougher line on pollution than the Bush administration. 

Full Text 
The Environmental Protection Agency is riling many businesses with proposals to regulate greenhouse gases for the first time, but data suggest it has been slow out of the gate under President Barack Obama in enforcing existing regulations on traditional pollutants. 
In fiscal 2009, the EPA's enforcement office required polluters to spend more than $5 billion on cleanup and emission controls -- down from $11.8 billion the previous year, according to a report recently published by the agency. The report, which examines the EPA's performance in enforcing limits on pollutants like sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and soot, covers the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, a period that covers the last 3 1/2 months of President George W. Bush's watch and the first 8 1/2 months of Mr. Obama's. 
Defendants in agency enforcement cases committed to cut pollution by about 580 million pounds in fiscal 2009, down from 3.9 billion pounds in fiscal 2008, according to the report. 
The numbers for the latest fiscal year were also below levels recorded between 2004 and 2007, when the EPA required polluters to spend an average of $8.3 billion annually cleaning up pollution and improving their controls. During the same period, defendants agreed to reduce pollution by 970 million pounds annually. 
Obama administration officials say a small number of cases can cause the agency's enforcement results to vary sharply from year to year. In fiscal 2008, around 40% of the EPA's pollution reductions resulted from a settlement with American Electric Power Co. 
Administration officials also say the report shows increases in other enforcement actions, such as the number of environmental-crime cases initiated in 2009 and the number of defendants charged with crimes. 
"We're hard at work pursuing violators," said Cynthia Giles, the EPA's assistant administrator for enforcement. "The size of the cases and the pounds of pollution reduced aren't the only measure of the enforcement effort." 
Since taking office, Mr. Obama's administration has promised to take a tougher line on pollution than the Bush administration. During Mr. Obama's presidency, the EPA has clashed with business groups by holding up mountaintop-mining permits, launched an investigation into whether the herbicide atrazine causes cancer and birth defects, and promised new rules that would treat coal ash as hazardous waste. In the spring, the agency is expected to announce a new rule intended to limit air pollution that crosses state lines. 
The agency is also moving to expand its reach. The Obama EPA has proposed regulations that would limit auto emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to climate change. More rules for power plants, refineries and other emitters are on the way. 
The spate of new regulations has triggered lawsuits by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups seeking to challenge the legality of the EPA's determination that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, the legal predicate for regulating them. Lawmakers in both parties are pushing proposals to overturn the finding. The Obama administration says the finding is grounded in "overwhelming science" and the law. 
Not including stimulus-related funding, the EPA's overall budget rose 36% in 2010. But funding for enforcement rose by less than 5%. Mr. Obama has proposed cutting the EPA's overall budget slightly in fiscal 2011, but would increase funding for enforcement by 3%. 
Granta Nakayama, who ran the EPA's enforcement office under Mr. Bush, said the agency's initial enforcement results under Mr. Obama could partly reflect the agency's increased emphasis on "environmental justice." 
A list of enforcement goals published by the EPA last month says the agency will "advance environmental justice by protecting vulnerable communities." 
Mr. Nakayama, an attorney who represents businesses regulated by the EPA, said the agency should try to protect vulnerable communities from being disproportionately affected by pollution. But he said focusing on that goal too much risks diverting manpower and resources from big polluters, such as coal-fired power plants, that operate in remote areas. 
Ms. Giles said the agency's emphasis on environmental justice wasn't undercutting efforts to police big polluters. She pointed to a recent settlement with the U.S. unit of Lafarge SA, the French cement maker, as an example of how environmental justice went hand in hand with tackling big polluters. 
As part of the settlement, Lafarge agreed to install up to $170 million in new pollution controls at 13 plants. Some of the communities downwind from those plants are home to minorities or have traditionally been underserved by the agency, EPA officials said.

Abstract 
The spot uranium price surged to a record $138 a pound in 2007, the year Sparton announced plans to test and possibly commercialize uranium recovery at a coal-fired power station in China's Yunnan province. [...] the spot price has plunged to about $42 a pound amid the global economic slump, though it remains far above its early 2001 level of approximately $7. 

Full Text 
Sparton Resources Inc., a small Toronto mining company, is betting that a global renaissance in nuclear power will create a market for an unlikely fuel source: waste coal ash. 
Natural coal contains trace amounts of uranium, and when it is burned to produce electricity, varying amounts of the radioactive element are left behind in the ash. Sparton has developed a method for recovering it and says a project under way at a coal-fired power station in southwestern China is yielding uranium that could be reused as a fuel for nuclear reactors. 
The company is exploring other sites in China, South Africa and in Eastern Europe, where ash was buried when Soviet-era power plants were shut down, to determine whether they have similar potential. 
Sparton's efforts come as concerns about climate change thrust nuclear power back into the spotlight as a way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Some analysts and mining companies are predicting a supply shortage of uranium within four to eight years if, as expected, China and other Asian nations accelerate programs to build nuclear reactors and European nations such as Sweden abandon their moratoriums on new nuclear plants. 
Extracting uranium from coal deposits isn't new: Union Carbide Corp. and Kerr McGee Corp. did it in North Dakota in the 1960s, selling what they produced to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. But interest in these and other secondary uranium-recovery techniques often hinges on the benchmark price for U3O8, a common compound of uranium. 
The spot uranium price surged to a record $138 a pound in 2007, the year Sparton announced plans to test and possibly commercialize uranium recovery at a coal-fired power station in China's Yunnan province. Since then, the spot price has plunged to about $42 a pound amid the global economic slump, though it remains far above its early 2001 level of approximately $7. Long-term contract prices, which make up the majority of uranium sales, are holding at about $61 a pound. 
Although Sparton says its Yunnan project is producing uranium at a cost that would appear to be economically competitive, some analysts say the recent pullback in uranium prices could limit the technology's appeal, at least for now. 
"Any nontraditional form of uranium production can and will only compete if the production costs are equal to or lower than traditional U3O8 mining and milling methods," says Jonathan Hinze, vice-president of international operations at Roswell, Ga.-based Ux Consulting Co. LLC. 
Coal-fired power stations produce more than 700 million tons of ash and other waste matter annually, with much of it stockpiled or disposed of in landfills. In China, more than 
2.7 billion tons of ash sit unused, according to a presentation delivered in May in the U.S. by experts at the East China University of Science and Technology. 
Not all waste ash is suitable for uranium recovery. Coal needs a uranium content of at least 50 parts per million to be comparable to a low-grade uranium deposit, says Robert Finkelman, a research scientist with the University of Texas at Dallas. In the U.S., the average coal deposit has only about two parts per million. In addition, some coal-fired power plants inject lime into burners to control emissions of sulfur. That can leave large amounts of excess lime or calcium carbonate in the ash, which makes it harder and more expensive to get at the uranium. 
Sparton says it is confident that its Yunnan project, in which it has invested more than $5 million to date, can overcome these and other challenges. 
Three power plants located near its site are burning coal with a uranium content averaging 65 parts per million, and the lime content in the leftover ash is low, Sparton says. 
The company is recovering the uranium at a cost of $20 to $35 a pound, says A. Lee Barker, Sparton's president and chief executive officer. That makes the project economically competitive at the current spot uranium prices of about $42 a pound. 
The company has been able to hold down capital costs. That's partly because the coal feeding the plants comes from an existing mine, so it doesn't have to build one. 
To produce uranium at the site, Sparton puts the ash in acid in order to dissolve, and then extract, the uranium. Sparton says it can recover 70% of the uranium in the ash at Yunnan using this method. 
Then there are the environmental benefits. Sparton says uranium-extraction facilities like the one at Yunnan could help clean up ash piles that have been classified as hazardous because of their high uranium content. The material left over would then be suitable for use in cement or as a filler for concrete blocks, it says. 
Conventional uranium mining in China, which plans to increase its nuclear capacity at least fourfold by 2020, is closed to foreign companies. Focusing on waste ash has enabled Sparton to overcome this hurdle, as has its choice of joint-venture partner -- state-owned China National Nuclear Corp., the country's top nuclear power developer by capacity. 
Mr. Barker says Sparton could be producing up to two million pounds of uranium in China annually after three years, enough to fuel a new reactor. That forecast reflects the waste-coal-ash project in Yunnan and other secondary recovery activities in which Sparton is involved. 
Some mining companies -- Australia's PacMag Metals Ltd. and closely held NuCoal Energy Corp. of Saskatchewan, Canada, for example -- are looking into whether they can improve the economics of coal-related uranium-recovery projects by extracting other valuable metals at the same time. Some coal deposits may contain commercial amounts of metals such as germanium, which is used in products ranging from semiconductors to solar panels.

Abstract 
Unlike power plants that run on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, nuclear power plants don't produce significant greenhouse-gas emissions that have been blamed for contributing to climate change. 

Full Text 
A nuclear-power venture owned by NRG Energy Inc., Toshiba Corp. and a Texas utility resolved a legal dispute Wednesday that would allow one of the first U.S. nuclear-power projects in decades to proceed. 
The agreement, between the joint venture, Nuclear Innovation North America, and San Antonio municipal utility CPS Energy, reduces the utility's stake in the south Texas nuclear power project to 7.6%, from 50%, with the joint venture retaining 92.4%, according to CPS and NRG. 
The agreement ends a $32 billion lawsuit that CPS filed in December to reduce its participation in the project, and allows development of the plant to proceed, the companies said. 
The project is part of a wave of new nuclear power plant development for which the Obama administration has expressed support as a way to fight climate change and meet growing U.S. energy demand. Unlike power plants that run on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, nuclear power plants don't produce significant greenhouse-gas emissions that have been blamed for contributing to climate change. 
"With this agreement, we can continue developing one of the leading nuclear power projects in the country," said NINA Chief Executive Steve Winn. 
The agreement also resolves ownership issues that might have held up an application the companies filed for federal loan guarantees, said NRG spokesman Dave Knox. If the companies get the federal loan guarantees, NINA, which is 88%-owned by NRG and 12%-owned by Toshiba, has agreed to pay CPS $80 million and donate $10 million over four years to its residential customer assistance program. 
CPS said its remaining stake in the project is worth about $1 billion. The agreement requires CPS to help with the project's loan guarantee application, but excuses the utility from spending more money on the project. The utility has said it has spent about $370 million on the project's engineering and permitting. 
"This agreement extracts the maximum value for our community at this stage of the project's development," CPS Acting General Manager Jelynne LeBlanc Burley said in a statement. 
The settlement requires approval by the CPS board, which could make a decision as early as Monday. 
The project, estimated to cost between $9 billion and $12 billion, would add two new nuclear power units to an existing nuclear reactor, expanding the facility by 2,700 megawatts, enough power for more than 2 million homes. 
CPS sued NINA in December, alleging that NRG misled the utility on project costs and saying it might withdraw. In January, after initial negotiations failed, NRG Energy Chief Executive David Crane said the company would exit the project and suffer a $400 million write-off if the dispute couldn't be resolved. 
The two sides agreed before the dispute to each sell a 10% stake in the project, but uncertainty around CPS's involvement has stymied these efforts. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said last month it's considering purchasing a stake in the project and remains interested.

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's 2011 budget calls for an array of regulations, subsidies and taxes aimed at cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, even as a sweeping climate bill sits on ice in the Senate. 
Mr. Obama's budget calls for $39 billion in tax increases on fossil-fuel producers over 10 years. It also includes an estimated $1.4 billion to help developing countries address the impacts of climate change, reduce deforestation and shift to low-carbon energy sources. And it proposes tripling federal support for nuclear energy, by adding $36 billion in new loan authority for an Energy Department program aimed at speeding the construction of new reactors. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama sought to underscore his support for nuclear power by announcing that the Department of Energy had offered conditional commitments for $8.33 billion in loan guarantees for the construction and operation of two new nuclear reactors at a plant in Burke, Ga. Administration officials said it would be the first U.S. nuclear power plant to break ground in nearly three decades. 
The loan guarantees went to Southern Co., but other utilities say they are concerned that the government's fee for securing credit might be too costly. An Energy Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Mr. Obama's budget, unveiled earlier this month, would scale back tax breaks and other incentives for domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal. The moves are opposed by fossil-fuel producers. 
The administration's budget cites a 2009 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that said the world's 20 biggest economies could reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions 10% by phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies. 
Mr. Obama has called on Congress to pass legislation that would require industries to pay for their emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to climate change. But Senate leaders have repeatedly pushed back their timetable for action, amid objections from many Republicans and some Democrats that such legislation would drive up energy costs and lead to job losses in fossil-fuel and manufacturing industries. 
Environmental groups have largely applauded Mr. Obama's budget, though some have criticized his support for nuclear power, citing the growing cost of building reactors. 
The budget proposal also contains what Republicans say is a setback for nuclear-power interests: a proposal to cut off funding for the proposed nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
Republicans say killing Yucca Mountain leaves the U.S. without a clearly defined strategy for managing nuclear waste. The administration says the U.S. has time to find alternatives. 
The climate pieces of the president's budget are controversial. For example, a proposal to fund the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of carbon dioxide and the measures to step up taxes on fossil-fuel producers are drawing fire. 
Opponents say EPA action to curb greenhouse gases would lead to job losses. The EPA relies on state and local agencies to administer air-quality permits, but some state regulators have said new EPA rules could overwhelm them with paperwork and delay construction projects. 
But William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, says the group, which represents air-pollution control agencies across the U.S., supports Mr. Obama's request, which "reflects clearly the premium he and his administration place on clean air." 
Oil and natural-gas producers say the tax proposals would discourage domestic production of energy and frustrate Mr. Obama's goals of creating jobs and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The administration disputes the industry's claims.

Abstract 
Since 2006, Boulder has subsidized about 750 home energy audits. Authors of a landmark 2007 report on global warming have admitted to some errors in their work, though they stand by their conclusion that climate change is "unequivocal" and is "very likely" due to human activity, such as burning fossil fuels for energy.

BOULDER, Colo. -- This spring, city contractors will fan out across this well-to-do college town to unscrew light bulbs in thousands of homes and replace them with more energy-
efficient models, at taxpayer expense. 
City officials never dreamed they'd have to play nanny when they set out in 2006 to make Boulder a role model in the fight against global warming. The cause seemed like a 
natural fit in a place where residents tend to be politically liberal and passionate about the great outdoors. 

Instead, as Congress considers how to encourage Americans to conserve more energy, Boulder stands as a cautionary tale about the limits of good intentions. 

"What we've found is that for the vast majority of people, it's exceedingly difficult to get them to do much of anything," says Kevin Doran, a senior research fellow at the 
University of Colorado at Boulder. 
President Barack Obama has set ambitious goals for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, in part by improving energy efficiency. Last year's stimulus bill set aside billions to 

weatherize buildings. The president has also called for a "cash for caulkers" rebate for Americans who weatherize their homes. 

But Boulder has found that financial incentives and an intense publicity campaign aren't enough to spur most homeowners to action, even in a city so environmentally conscious 
that the college football stadium won't sell potato chips because the packaging isn't recyclable. 
Take George Karakehian. He considers himself quite green: He drives a hybrid, recycles, uses energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs. But he refuses to practice the most 

basic of conservation measures: Shutting the doors to his downtown art gallery when his heating or air conditioning is running. 
Mr. Karakehian knows he's wasting energy. He doesn't care. 
"I'm old-school," Mr. Karakehian says. "I've always been taught that an open door is the way to invite people in." 
He's not alone in ignoring the call to arms. 
Since 2006, Boulder has subsidized about 750 home energy audits. Even after the subsidy, the audits cost each homeowner up to $200, so only the most committed signed up. 

Still, follow-up surveys found half didn't implement even the simplest recommendations, despite incentives such as discounts on energy-efficient bulbs and rebates for attic insulation. 
About 75 businesses got free audits; they made so few changes that they collectively saved just one-fifth of the energy auditors estimated they were wasting. 
"We still have a long way to go," says Paul Sheldon, a consultant who advises the city on conservation. Residents "should be driving high-efficiency vehicles, and they're not. 
They should be carpooling, and they're not." And yes, he adds, they should be changing their own light bulbs -- and they're not. 

The science behind climate change has taken hits of late. Authors of a landmark 2007 report on global warming have admitted to some errors in their work, though they stand by their conclusion that climate change is "unequivocal" and is "very likely" due to human activity, such as burning fossil fuels for energy. British climate scientists have also come under fire after their hacked email correspondence seemed to indicate they tried to squelch dissenting views. 
Here in Boulder, some climate-change skeptics have become more vocal about their doubts in public and in online forums. For the most part, those working on the energy-efficiency plan say the public still backs it. The hitch is in getting residents to move from philosophical support to concrete action. As Mr. Sheldon put it, until his neighbors all decide, "'We're doing this!' . . . the city will be pushing a rope uphill." 
A city of 100,000, tucked up against the Rocky Mountains, Boulder has a proud history of environmentalism. It was one of the first to levy a tax to protect open space. 
Residents bike to work at 20 times the national average. 
In 2006, Boulder voters approved the nation's first "carbon tax," now $21 a year per household, to fund energy-conservation programs. The city took out print ads, bought radio 
time, sent email alerts and promoted the campaign in city newsletters. 

But Boulder's carbon emissions edged down less than 1% from 2006 through 2008, the most recent data available. 
By the end of 2008, emissions here were 27% higher than 1990 levels. That's a worse showing than the U.S. as a whole, where emissions rose 15% during that period, 
according to the Department of Energy. 

"If a place like Boulder that regards itself as being in the environmental forefront has such a tough time, these types of efforts are not going to work as a core policy" for the 

nation, says Roger Pielke Jr., who studies the political response to climate change at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
One problem: People don't want to give up gadgets. Recently, Prof. Pielke taught a seminar on energy demand. The university had installed motion-detector lights that shut off 
when the room is vacant to save energy. But when he asked his 17 students to lay all their iPods, cellphones and laptops on their desks, they had 42 electronic devices among 
them. Powering those up, he said, negated any conservation value from the fancy lights. 

A local home-theater installer says most customers purchase a power strip, so they can turn off the outlet when they're not watching. But during the Christmas holidays, 65­inch flat-screen TVs flew off the shelves of Boulder's ListenUp Audio/Video. "People are definitely going for bigger screens," manager Bob Murphy says. 

City officials are frustrated -- and contemplating more forceful steps. 
The City Council will soon consider mandating energy-efficiency upgrades to many apartments and businesses. The proposals under review would be among the most aggressive 
in the nation, requiring up to $4,000 a rental unit in new appliances, windows and other improvements. Owners of commercial property could face far larger tabs. 

The goal: to spur $650 million in private investment in efficiencies over the next three years. 
"Everyone needs to do something," says Councilman Matthew Appelbaum. 
Unless the city does it for them. Recognizing that, as Mr. Appelbaum puts it, "it's a real pain to do all that work," Boulder plans to spend about $1.5 million in city funds and 

$370,000 in federal stimulus money to hire contractors to do basic upgrades for residents. 
In the program, dubbed "Two Techs in a Truck," as many as 15 energy-efficiency teams will go door-to-door. They'll ask home and business owners for permission to caulk 

windows, change bulbs and install low-flow showerheads and programmable thermostats -- all at taxpayer expense. The techs will set up clothes racks in laundry rooms as a 
reminder to use the dryer less often. They'll even pop into the garage and inflate tires to the optimum pressure for fuel efficiency. 
If they spot the need for bigger projects, such as insulation or a new furnace, the techs will help homeowners make appointments and apply for rebates. 
Some grumble about Big Brother: "It's like, 'We're going to find a way to make sure you do this the way we want you to,' " says Robert Greenlee, a former mayor. 
City officials say most residents want to make these changes; they just never seem to get around to it. In a test run in a lower-income Boulder neighborhood, nearly 70% of 

homeowners accepted the free upgrades. "We want to take away the financial barrier and the hassle barrier," said Kara Mertz, the city's local environmental action manager. 

That may not be enough. 
Kathie Joyner, an environmental planner, was one of the first to get a city-subsidized home-energy audit, back in 2006. She eagerly trailed the auditor through her modest 
bungalow, watching as he pointed out leaks and inefficiencies. He promised she could slash her utility bills by a third. 

Ms. Joyner vowed to get to work. But tackling the whole list would have cost $4,000. She ended up spending less than $1,000, mostly on insulation and weather-stripping. The 

rest of the advice, she set aside. "It just kind of went out of my brain," she says. 
Three years later, Ms. Joyner says she hasn't noticed lower energy bills, in part because of rising rates and fluctuations in her electricity use depending on the weather. 
Frustrated, she says she isn't sure her investment paid off, either for her pocketbook or the planet. That discouraged her from spending more on the project. "That's the big 
disconnect for most of us," she says. "It's all very squishy. We're not really sure if it matters." 

Among the most successful of Boulder's green initiatives, as measured by participation, is a program under which residents pay the local utility a premium -- up to about $25 a 

month -- to support wind power. That requires no effort beyond opening a checkbook. About 5,500 households participate. 
By comparison, just 45 businesses committed to cut their energy use by 10% within a year, a pledge requiring more active steps. The city estimates those businesses will cut 
greenhouse-gas emissions by a total of 17,000 metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent. That's approximately the amount of carbon dioxide that 3,100 average U.S. cars emit 
in a year. Sending two techs in a truck to do the work for other, less-motivated businesses will reduce emissions far more -- an estimated 88,000 tons -- but at far greater 
taxpayer expense. 

Relying on voluntary action is "slow to show significant results," the city concluded in a report last fall that called for stepped-up regulation. 

James W.C. White, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado, says the city deserves credit for trying to push energy efficiencies. "It's always hard being 
out in front," he says, "but somebody's got to lead." 
The city aims to overcome public inertia with a fresh advertising approach. Instead of talking about environmental benefits, new promotions will focus on financial benefits: Save 

energy, save money. 

But there are signs Boulder's efforts are starting to lose favor. Voters county-wide last fall rejected a measure that would have doubled a public fund set up to give homeowners 
low-interest loans for efficiency upgrades, such as a new furnace. 
In the same November election, city voters elected to the council several newcomers eager to moderate Boulder's aggressive environmentalism. 
Among the newly elected: Mr. Karakehian, the gallery owner who insists on keeping his front door open. He is concerned about the city mandating conservation and says his 

constituents agree. 
"My phone has been ringing off the hook," he says. "I've had a lot of people talk to me. Not happy people. Maybe we've bit off more than we can chew." 
There are, of course, true believers in Boulder. Councilman Macon Cowles, who won re-election last fall, almost never drives, has stopped heating his pool and just re-insulated 

his home. The Shanahan neighborhood in Boulder offers "solar tours" of local photovoltaic panels. Two years ago, just a dozen homes there had solar. Now, nearly 50 do. 

Jeff Hohensee, a sustainability consultant, invested $125,000 in home-energy upgrades -- though with rebates, his cost was $35,000 -- so his home uses only as much energy 
as solar panels on his roof produce. To spur neighbors to follow suit, he suggests the city measure every home's carbon footprint and publicize the results. 
City officials aren't willing to go that far. But they are hoping to leverage peer pressure. They plan to post congratulatory signs outside homes that have let the "two techs in a 

truck" change the light bulbs. They'll offer prizes to churches and schools that get commitments from, say, 100 families to insulate their attics. They'll host energy-efficiency 
block parties and plan to hire a consultant to create a conservation buzz on Facebook and Twitter. 
Even if residents implement every possible efficiency, it will take Boulder only part of the way toward its goal of slashing emissions of the pollutants linked to global warming. 

More than 1,000 U.S. cities have pledged to make such cuts, yet analysts say most are stymied -- in part because it's extremely difficult to reduce emissions without a wholesale switch to renewable energy sources. Boulder depends almost entirely for energy on a coal-powered plant. Jonathan Koehn, the city's regional sustainability coordinator, feels the pressure keenly. "People say, 'It's Boulder! Kooky Boulder! Of course you can do it,'" he says, and sighs. "Not necessarily."

Abstract 
The new company, which would retain the FirstEnergy name and be based in Akron, Ohio, would be 70%-dependent on coal for power generation, although 70% of that production would come from modern coal units that have been outfitted with scrubbers to cut emissions. 

Full text 
FirstEnergy Corp. agreed to acquire Allegheny Energy Inc. for $4.7 billion in a stock deal that would create a big regional utility but could encounter resistance from states. 
The transaction -- the kind long predicted by analysts but slow to materialize in the fragmented utility sector -- would create a company with 10 utilities and six million customers stretching across seven states. 
The companies will have to persuade state regulators, who often have resisted mergers because of such concerns as job cuts and reduced maintenance spending, that the deal benefits customers. The companies said merger savings could top $530 million by the fifth year, before certain costs, and that some of those savings would be shared with customers, subject to negotiations with states. FirstEnergy also would assume $3.8 billion of Allegheny's debt. 
Many utilities expect big capital needs -- to update power-delivery systems with "smart grid" capabilities, clean up power-plant fleets and add renewable energy, for example -­and are looking for ways to come up with the money. 
Anthony Alexander, chief executive of FirstEnergy and slated to head a combined firm, said in an interview that the combined company would have a stronger balance sheet and should have easier access to capital. 
Mr. Alexander said that even though the two firms have some overlap, he doesn't expect job cuts, at least not in field workers responsible for maintenance. 
The combination wouldn't diversify the companies away from coal, which has been criticized because of climate-change concerns. The new company, which would retain the FirstEnergy name and be based in Akron, Ohio, would be 70%-dependent on coal for power generation, although 70% of that production would come from modern coal units that have been outfitted with scrubbers to cut emissions. 
The deal, which would increase earnings in the first year, calls for Allegheny shareholders to receive 0.667 share of FirstEnergy stock for each share of their stock, giving Allegheny shares a value of $27.65, a 32% premium over Wednesday's closing price. 
Neither company has been on the leading edge of smart-grid investments, which are designed to replace the largely electromechanical system with a digital network intended to improve efficiency. "We want to make sure we deploy the right technology" before spending a lot of money, FirstEnergy's Mr. Alexander said. 
The combined company would have $16 billion in annual revenue and $1.4 billion in expected income from utilities in the traditionally regulated states of Virginia and West Virginia and deregulated states of Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. 
The key states will be Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Allegheny also will need approval in Virginia. Regulators from Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania weren't available to comment but typically decline to comment on matters likely to come before them. 
Large mergers in recent years have stumbled amid state resistance, including proposed transactions between FPL Group Inc. and Constellation Energy Group Inc., and Exelon Corp. and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.

Abstract 
The result could give generators less flexibility, and leave more plants needing to install pollution-control equipment known as scrubbers, wrote Hugh Wynne, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York in a recent report. Besides the pending air regulations, coal-fired plants are expected to face tougher regulations on mercury emissions and the handling of coal ash left over from the combustion process. 

Full Text 
Tighter U.S. air-pollution regulations could touch off a wave of closures of coal-fired power plants even as federal climate-change legislation appears stalled. 
A crackdown on air emissions first proposed by the administration of George W. Bush, coupled with sluggish power prices, could make dozens of older coal-fired plants lacking pollution-control equipment uneconomic to run. Barclays Capital analysts estimate 27,000 megawatts of production, or more than 2% of U.S. generating capacity, could close in four to five years. In addition, power companies could be required to spend an additional $42 billion on pollution-control equipment for plants that continue to run. 
Air-quality regulations are expected to hit generators that sell power at market prices the hardest, as they can't rely on regulated rates to pass on directly the costs of adding pollution controls or building new and cleaner plants. Citi analysts estimate FirstEnergy Corp., Dynegy Inc. and RRI Energy Inc. are among the most exposed to stricter air rules. Barclays warns Edison International and Dynegy could face the most costly retrofits. 
Tougher pollution rules could provide opportunities as well. The closure of coal-fired plants could boost wholesale power and capacity prices in the Northeast as supplies tighten, benefiting companies such as FPL Group Inc. and Entergy Corp. Earnings of regulated utilities depend on the amount of capital they invest, so environmental upgrades and new plant construction could provide growth opportunities for American Electric Power Co. Inc. and others. 
Much of the focus in the last year has been on the emissions of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide linked to climate change. Coal-fired plants have been at the center of the debate because of they are large emitters of CO2. But global talks in Copenhagen in December produced no binding agreement on CO2 limits, and federal legislation remains stalled in the U.S. Senate. 
Investor attention is shifting to traditional pollutants, which have been regulated for many years to protect human health and air quality. Revised clean-air regulations are expected from the Environmental Protection Agency this year, possibly as early as the spring. 
The new rules are several years old, dating to the Clean Air Interstate Rule issued by the Bush administration. The regulations proposed a 28-state cap-and-trade system across the eastern half of the U.S. for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. But the courts rejected the program, leaving the revisions up to the EPA under the administration of President Barack Obama. 
Analysts warn the program could turn out to be stricter than originally proposed as the Obama administration looks to boost its own environmental credentials and comply with the courts. 
The new rules could stretch beyond the current eastern U.S. states to include more plants. At the same time, the court rulings may prompt the EPA to ratchet back the cap-and­trade system that otherwise would allow plants to buy and sell emission allowances as a way to meet the new limits. 
The result could give generators less flexibility, and leave more plants needing to install pollution-control equipment known as scrubbers, wrote Hugh Wynne, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York in a recent report. 
Besides the pending air regulations, coal-fired plants are expected to face tougher regulations on mercury emissions and the handling of coal ash left over from the combustion process. 
Yet Bruce Williamson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy, doesn't see a bleak picture ahead for the company's plants. The merchant generator is in the middle of a $1 billion program in the Midwest to add pollution control equipment at several coal-fired plants after reaching an agreement with the EPA that runs through 2016. 
"I think the people that will face the biggest challenges are the coal plants that have not been scrubbed . . . and haven't been cleaned up already," he said at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit in Colorado recently.

Abstract 
[...] supply surged as liquefied-natural-gas projects came onstream and production of unconventional shale gas boomed in the U.S. "I don't have very good news for Russia, I'm afraid," Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, told an investment conference in Moscow last week. 

Full Text 
OAO Gazprom is seeking to reassure investors of its growth prospects as a looming supply glut threatens to depress European demand for Russian natural gas for years. 
Gazprom's managers, in the midst of a roadshow that takes them to Moscow, London and New York this month, are telling investors the company's share of the European natural-gas market will grow to nearly a third by 2020 from about a quarter now. Meanwhile, a Gazprom presentation shows sales to all export markets outside the former Soviet Union will more than double -- to between 320 billion and 345 billion cubic 
meters by 2030 from about 140 billion cubic meters this year. The company says it will export 161 billion cubic meters to Europe this year, up 15% from last year. 
Gazprom's growth targets, however, contrast with recent changes in the global natural-gas market. The company's exports slumped last year as the economic downturn slashed industrial demand for the fuel. Meanwhile, supply surged as liquefied-natural-gas projects came onstream and production of unconventional shale gas boomed in the U.S. "I don't have very good news for Russia, I'm afraid," Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, told an investment conference in Moscow last week. He said 
the supply glut would last until 2015. 
The industry's changes mark a big shift from the days when Russia sought to remake itself as an energy superpower and was accused by the U.S. and others of using its natural-gas exports as a geopolitical weapon to bully its neighbors. Gazprom itself acknowledged how weak energy demand is changing its strategy when it announced a three-year delay to the start of its massive Shtokman field in the Arctic on 
Friday. Shtokman was supposed to produce its first gas in 2013 and begin shipments of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to North America in 2014. 
In a statement, Gazprom said it had agreed with partners Statoil ASA, of Norway, and France's Total SA to postpone production from Shtokman until 2016. It already has put back the start date for another big gas field, Bovanenkovo on the Arctic Yamal peninsula, by a year until 2012. Gazprom officials predict the supply glut will dissipate more quickly than Mr. Birol of the IEA says. European demand will rebound by 2012, they say -- with climate-change 
policies being a key driver. 
Gas burns much more cleanly than coal and is widely seen as an important bridge to a low-carbon future. 
They also point to the decline in domestic European production of gas in places like the North Sea, which will boost demand for imports. 
Meanwhile, Gazprom says its market share in Europe is underpinned by a large portfolio of long-term contracts. 
It says it already has contracted to deliver 3.1 trillion cubic meters of gas to Europe between this year and 2035, according to the presentation to investors, guaranteeing 

revenue of about $1 trillion. 
The big game-changer for suppliers like Gazprom has been the shale-gas boom in the U.S. Deposits of natural gas trapped in shale-rock formations that once were considered 
too costly to exploit have become commercially viable thanks to innovative technologies such as horizontal drilling and new ways of fracturing rock. 

U.S. shale-gas output grew from less than a billion cubic feet a day in 1998 to about five billion cubic feet daily last year. In 2009, the U.S. overtook Russia as the world's largest natural-gas producer. 
Russian officials have tended to downplay the unconventional-gas revolution and warn of dangers in exploiting the resource. Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy chief executive, told an industry conference in October that the potential pollution of water reservoirs caused by shale-gas production could be a problem. 
But the surge in American output has affected Gazprom by increasing competition between suppliers in Europe. LNG cargoes that originally were destined for the U.S. have been diverted to European markets, driving down spot prices below the oil-linked price of gas in Gazprom's long-term supply contracts. Some customers responded last year by buying the minimum amount of gas allowed under their contracts with Gazprom and buying more LNG instead.

Abstract 
We may be able to separate these things out. [...] it's possible that that's where the Senate ends up. [...] the Obama administration has refused to entertain in public the idea that lawmakers might have to split up the climate bill. 

Full Text 
NASHUA, N.H. -- President Barack Obama said for the first time Tuesday that legislation that would require industries to pay for emissions of greenhouse gases might need to be separated from a more popular "green jobs" bill in the Senate, a maneuver that could kill what once had been one of the administration's top policy priorities. 
Answering a participant in a town-hall meeting in Nashua who asked about green jobs -- those connected to renewable energy -- and so-called cap-and-trade legislation, Mr. Obama said, "The only thing I would say about it is this: We may be able to separate these things out. And it's possible that that's where the Senate ends up." 
Until now, the Obama administration has refused to entertain in public the idea that lawmakers might have to split up the climate bill. The shift by the president is another sign that the White House is rethinking strategy on big first-year agenda items such as health care and climate legislation, after public dissatisfaction with its focus on those issues helped cost Democrats their filibuster-proof hold on the Senate last month. 
The idea behind the cap-and-trade aspect of the climate bill is to create a market in permits that confer the right to emit greenhouse gases, which are believed to contribute to global warming. Businesses would be required to hold these permits, and over time the government would curtail the supply of permits to reduce the total amount of gases produced. 
A White House spokesman played down the president's comments, saying Mr. Obama still favored a bill that would combine measures to encourage jobs in green-energy fields with the establishment of a trading mechanism for emissions. 
Isolating the cap-and-trade proposal would make it easier for Democrats who oppose putting a price on greenhouse-gas emissions to set that part of the climate bill aside, and vote for the more popular jobs incentives now contained in the wide-ranging measure. 
In his State of the Union speech last week, Mr. Obama pushed for "a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America." 
The climate bill in the Senate is opposed by legislators from both parties whose local economies rely on fossil fuels, and smokestack industries like steel mills and coal-fired utilities. These lawmakers worry a cap-and-trade system will burden these industries with new costs. 
Mr. Obama's comments on Tuesday came amid new signs of resistance by some fellow Democrats to his administration's efforts to combat climate change. 
On Tuesday, two senior House Democrats -- Reps. Ike Skelton of Missouri, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee -- introduced legislation to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse-gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. In a written statement, Mr. Skelton called for setting aside legislation already passed by the House to cap greenhouse-gas emissions, and instead passing "scaled-back energy legislation" that could command greater support in both parties. 
"We cannot tolerate turning over the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions to unelected bureaucrats at EPA," Mr. Skelton said. 
One possibility for Senate Democrats is to push forward with a bill already approved by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that would require electric utilities nationwide to generate 15% of their electricity supplies through renewable resources, with some portion met by energy efficiency measures, by 2021. The bill would also open the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to leasing and exploration for oil and gas, and establish energy efficiency standard for table and floor lamps.

Abstract 
All the major climate economic models show that to achieve the much-discussed goal of keeping temperature rises under two degrees Celsius, we would have to impose a global tax on carbon emissions that, by the end of the century, would cost the world a phenomenal $40 trillion a year. 

Full Text 
With most of the world still reeling from the worst recession in 40 years, this week some 2,500 members of the international political, business and media elite are descending on Davos, Switzerland. The occasion is the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, that well-publicized Woodstock for movers and shakers. The point of Davos is to swap big ideas about big issues, and this year's theme couldn't be bigger: "Improving the State of the World: Rethink, Redesign, Rebuild." 
If you detect a whiff of "back to the drawing board" in that slogan, you're right. There is a growing consensus in policy circles that if the recent economic carnage has taught us anything, it's that our 20th-century prescriptions are not up to the challenges of our 21st-century world. 
This kind of intellectual humility would certainly be welcome in my particular area of interest: the debate over how best to cope with man-made climate change. For nearly two decades, environmental policy makers have been single-mindedly marching down the same road, trying without success to get the governments of the world to endorse a binding agreement to drastically reduce carbon emissions. Just last month, we saw this strategy fail again when yet another global climate summit convened and adjourned without accomplishing anything. Yet policy makers refuse to change course. 
There is a superficial logic to the conventional wisdom that the only serious way to stop global warming is to get governments to either force or bribe their citizens into slashing their reliance on fuels that emit carbon-dioxide. After all, if carbon emissions cause global warming, shouldn't eliminating them cure it? 
Yes, it would. The question is at what cost? The fact is that whatever prosperity we currently have or are likely to achieve in the near future depends heavily on our ability to acquire and burn carbon-emitting fuels such as coal, oil and gas. 
Right now, developing nations like China and India are most vocal in their opposition to cutting carbon emissions -- and it is not hard to see why. Compared to other forms of energy, fossil fuels are abundant, efficient and cheap. In order to make drastic cuts in their carbon emissions, developing countries would have to pull the plug on domestic economic growth -- thus consigning hundreds of millions of their citizens to continued poverty. 
But the developed world has an interest at stake here as well. All the major climate economic models show that to achieve the much-discussed goal of keeping temperature rises under two degrees Celsius, we would have to impose a global tax on carbon emissions that, by the end of the century, would cost the world a phenomenal $40 trillion a year. Even the wealthiest of nations would have trouble paying that price. 
Viewed in this light, it's no wonder so many governments are skeptical of the idea that environmental salvation lies in just saying no to fossil fuels. So what's the alternative? I believe it's time to take a page from the World Economic Forum's book and rethink, redesign and rebuild our climate policy. 
Despite all the optimistic talk about solar, wind and other green-energy technologies, the alternatives we currently have aren't anywhere close to being able to carry more than a fraction of the load fossil fuels currently bear. For two decades, we've been putting the cart before the horse, pretending we could cut carbon emissions now and solve the technology problem later. But as we saw in Copenhagen last month, that makes neither economic nor political sense. 
If we really want to solve global warming, we need to get serious about developing alternatives to coal and oil. Last year, the Copenhagen Consensus Center commissioned research from more than two dozen of the world's top climate economists on different ways to respond to global warming. 
An expert panel including three Nobel Laureate economists concluded that devoting just 0.2% of global GDP -- roughly $100 billion a year -- to green-energy R&D could produce the kind of breakthroughs needed to fuel a carbon-free future. Not only would this be a much less expensive fix than trying to cut carbon emissions, it would also reduce global warming far more quickly. 
Mr. Lomborg is the director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center at Copenhagen Business School and the author of "Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming" (Knopf, 2007).

Abstract 
First in East Texas and in the outskirts of Fort Worth, companies began pumping water under enormous pressure to see if they could break open dense shale-rock formations to release gas. 

Full Text 
SHREVEPORT, La. -- A mounting backlash against a technique used in natural-gas drilling is threatening to slow development of the huge gas fields that some hope will reduce 
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and polluting coal. 
The U.S. energy industry says there is enough untapped domestic natural gas to last a century -- but getting to that gas requires injecting millions of gallons of water into the ground to crack open the dense rocks holding the deposits. The process, known as hydraulic fracturing, has turned gas deposits in shale formations into an energy bonanza. 
The industry's success has triggered increasing debate over whether the drilling process could pollute freshwater supplies. Federal and state authorities are considering action that could regulate hydraulic fracturing, potentially making drilling less profitable and giving companies less reason to tap into this ample supply of natural gas. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. placed itself squarely in the middle of the wrangling when it agreed last month to acquire gas producer XTO Energy Inc., a fracturing pioneer, in a deal now valued at $29 billion. Wary of the rising outcry, Exxon negotiated the right to back out of its deal if Congress passes a law to make hydraulic fracturing illegal or "commercially impracticable." 
On Wednesday, Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson faced questions about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing at a Capitol Hill hearing on the merger. 
"We can now find and produce unconventional natural-gas supplies miles below the surface in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner," Mr. Tillerson told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Criticism of hydraulic fracturing was muted at the hearing, with most representatives focusing on the potential benefits of increased gas use. But the merger has given drilling opponents a new target. 
"It puts Exxon at front and center of this whole issue," said Michael Passoff, associate director of As You Sow, an environmental-minded investment group. 
Even before the Exxon-XTO deal, the controversy over hydraulic fracturing, also known as "fracking" or "fracing," was growing. 
Oilmen were injecting water into wells to free up valuable oil and gas as far back as the 1940s. But in the past decade the technique has really taken off. First in East Texas and in the outskirts of Fort Worth, companies began pumping water under enormous pressure to see if they could break open dense shale-rock formations to release gas. 
These initial efforts were largely welcomed by communities, with homeowners and landlords often receiving lucrative checks for the mineral rights that allowed companies to drill on their land. 
When early efforts succeeded, the companies began running bigger fracturing jobs, using more water and higher pressure -- and in turn searching for even more gas-bearing shale deposits. 
This took the gas industry into places where drilling was less common in modern times, including downtown Fort Worth, northeastern Pennsylvania and within the city limits of Shreveport, La. 
Hydraulic fracturing and some other technology improvements have created a way to tap a domestic fuel source that has proved abundant. U.S. natural-gas production has risen about 20% since 2005 in large part because of these developments, making gas a much bigger player in energy-policy planning. 
Natural gas heats more than half of U.S. homes and generates a fifth of America's electricity, far less than coal, which provides the U.S. with nearly half its power. The industry and its allies are promoting natural gas a bridge fuel to help wean the U.S. off coal, which emits more global-warming gases, and imported oil until renewable fuels are able to meet the demand. 
What most worries environmentalists isn't the water in the fracturing process -- it's the chemicals mixed in the water to reduce friction, kill bacteria and prevent mineral buildup. The chemicals make up less than 1% of the overall solution, but some are hazardous in low concentrations. 
Today, the industry estimates that 90% of all new gas wells are fractured. Shale -- a dense, nonporous gas-bearing rock -- won't release its gas unless it is cracked open, and other types of formations also produce more gas when fractured. Easier, more porous formations, which don't require fracturing, were tapped in earlier decades and have largely dried up. 
As the industry has honed its techniques, hydraulic-fracturing operations have become more complex, requiring far more water and chemicals -- millions of gallons per well, rather than tens or hundreds of thousands of gallons in the past. 
Environmentalists and some community activists fear hydraulic fracturing could contaminate drinking-water supplies. They point to recent incidents that they say are linked to fracturing, including a water-well explosion in Dimock, Pa., and a chemical spill here in Shreveport. 
The industry says fracturing is safe and argues that there have been only a handful of incidents among the large number of wells that have been fractured over the past 50 years. "Hydraulic fracturing has been used since the 1940s in more than one million wells in the United States. It's safe and effective," says Exxon spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman. 
Even if the industry can make its case, it still must deal with the public-relations and political fallout from some of the questionable incidents. 
On a recent Friday morning, a crew from Cudd Energy Services worked to fracture a Chesapeake Energy Corp. well in Caddo Parish, La., the heart of the Haynesville Shale gas field. While cattle chewed grass in a field across the street, a team of Chesapeake and Cudd employees monitored computer readouts as 21 diesel-powered pumps forced nearly 3,800 gallons of water a minute down a well that reached two miles into the earth. 
It is a process Chesapeake says it has learned how to do both efficiently and safely. "We've done it 10,000 times in the company's history without incident," said Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake's chairman and chief executive officer, in a separate interview. 
But in a coffee shop in nearby Shreveport, Caddo Parish Commissioner Matthew Linn said he had concerns after more than a dozen cows died during a Chesapeake Energy fracturing operation last year. A preliminary investigation linked the deaths to chemicals that spilled off the well site into a nearby pasture. A Chesapeake spokesman says the company compensated the cattle's owner and has taken steps to prevent a similar incident in the future. 
"I'm all for drilling, and I want to get the gas out from underneath us," Mr. Linn said. "But at the same time, how do you balance human life and quality of life and clean water against that?" 
Natural-gas companies say what's at work is fear of the new. "When you introduce something like hydraulic fracturing in a part of the country that hasn't had any experience with it, I think it's natural for there to be questions about the procedure," says Mr. McClendon. 
Regardless, the industry faces a real prospect of tightened rules that could make it harder, or impractical, to use hydraulic fracturing. In June, congressional Democrats introduced legislation that would regulate fracturing at the federal level for the first time. The bills remain in committee. In October, the house formally asked the Environmental Protection Agency to study the risks posed by fracturing. 
Several states, including Colorado, Pennsylvania and New York, have either passed or are considering tightening regulations on fracturing and related activities. Members of the House of Representatives pushing for new legislation argue that federal oversight is needed to protect water supplies because state regulations vary widely. 
The industry worries that new regulations would hurt the thin margins on many gas wells and cut the financial incentive to tap the U.S.'s vast supply of gas. "There is an anticipation that more federal oversight would add enough costs to make it uneconomical, even it wasn't outright prohibited," said Gary Adams, vice chairman of Deloitte LLP's oil and gas consulting division. 
Already, the growing concerns about the practice are causing some companies to rethink where they drill. Chesapeake last fall publicly abandoned plans to drill in the watershed that provides New York City with its drinking water after opposition from city officials and others who feared a spill could contaminate the water. Talisman Energy Inc. says it is shifting its drilling effort away from New York because of regulatory challenges there. 
There have been attempts to regulate fracturing before. The 1974 Safe Water Drinking Act regulated wells that injected liquids underground. The federal courts ruled the law covered fracturing in a 1990s lawsuit from Alabama. But the technique was exempted from federal oversight in the 2005 Energy Bill. 
Some argue there is little really known about whether fracturing poses a genuine risk to water supplies. Hannah Wiseman, a visiting law professor at the University of Texas, Austin, says tighter regulation may be warranted. "There just isn't enough information out there right now about the effects," she said. 
Some of the potential threats are clearer than others, however. Gas-bearing shale formations typically lie a mile or more below the surface, with thousands of feet of nonporous rock separating them from even the deepest freshwater aquifers. 
Most people agree that means that if a fracturing job is done correctly, it would be virtually impossible for water or chemicals to seep upward into drinking water supplies. 
The industry argues that there has never been a proven case of water contamination caused by fracturing. But regulators have tied multiple incidents to oil and gas drilling more generally. Environmental groups point out that wells aren't always constructed properly. Moreover, they say, storage ponds that hold chemical-laced water after fracturing is complete can overflow, and trucks carrying chemicals can crash. 
A poorly sealed well is the alleged cause of gas escaping into an underground aquifer in Dimock, Pa. Gas also built up in one resident's water well, causing an explosion in January 2009. 
The company that drilled the wells, Cabot Oil & Gas, paid a $120,000 fine to settle the matter with the state, but has denied responsibility for the contamination and says fracturing couldn't have been the cause. 
"I could never sell this house now," said Dimock resident Craig Sautner, who now has drinking water shipped to him by Cabot. "Our pristine water that we used to have? It's done." 
Whether it is the act of fracturing itself or the risk of contamination from related activities is somewhat beside the point, says Amy Mall, a senior policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has raised concerns about fracturing. "Ultimately it's semantics. Somebody's water got contaminated," she says. 
Still, for Exxon, the hearings this week presented an opportunity to highlight its investment in developing U.S. energy supplies and creating jobs. Most of its investments in recent years have been overseas. And Exxon executives usually face congressional grilling only when oil and gasoline prices skyrocket. 
"This should probably be a very pleasant change of pace for Exxon Mobil because it's not going to be an argument about high oil and gasoline prices," says William Hederman, an energy analyst with Washington research firm Concept Capital.

Abstract 
Simon Dyer, an engineer and oil-sands expert for the Pembina Institute, a nonprofit Canadian energy think tank, estimated that roughly one-tenth of a metric ton of carbon dioxide is emitted per barrel of oil produced from the oil sands, meaning the cost of oil sands CCS could add more than $20 to the cost of a barrel of oil, depending upon the project. 

Full Text 
Greenhouse-gas emissions from Canada's oil-sands industry are growing at near the same rapid pace as the flow of crude to the U.S., but experts say the only technology able to cut emissions directly is too costly. 
Canada's government wants keep a step ahead of regulations that could penalize high emission rates by promoting and funding carbon capture and storage technology as a way to expand the oil sands while also cutting emissions. But experts say oil sands CCS projects are far too expensive, and money would be better spent cutting emissions from other sectors of Canada's economy, such as from coal-fired electric generation and through more efficient transportation. 
CCS technology traps carbon emissions, which are believed to cause global warming, before they enter the atmosphere, and pumps them underground for long-term storage. It is seen as the only significant technology able to cut emissions from oil sands production, which is growing rapidly. Oil-sands production is expected to grow to two million barrels a day by 2020, an increase of about two-thirds, while its emissions are expected to keep pace. However, estimates by the energy industry and independent researchers have concluded that carbon capture in oil sands operations is, at least for the time being, too expensive for the industry to adopt without government funding. Capturing CO2 from the natural-gas-fired boilers used in underground oil sands production costs between C$225 and C$250 (US$216-US$240) per metric ton, according to an independent report commissioned by the provincial government of Alberta. Capturing emissions from technology used to upgrade oil sands into lighter products costs between C$125 and C$225 per metric ton, according to the report. 
Simon Dyer, an engineer and oil-sands expert for the Pembina Institute, a nonprofit Canadian energy think tank, estimated that roughly one-tenth of a metric ton of carbon dioxide is emitted per barrel of oil produced from the oil sands, meaning the cost of oil sands CCS could add more than $20 to the cost of a barrel of oil, depending upon the project. Those high costs are the main reason why there are only a few carbon-capture projects.

Investing in Funds: A Quarterly Analysis --- A Classic Dividend Play: Utilities funds, near the bottom of the performance charts in 2009, still have appeal for income-oriented investors

Abstract 
Most of the utilities funds that remained within hailing distance of the general market returns last year were those that branched out from U.S. electric utilities by adding more volatile stocks such as telecommunications providers and foreign utilities, a strategy that hurt them in 2008. 

Full Text 
Utility stocks didn't fully participate in last year's market rebound and may remain laggards for some time, given the likelihood of an anemic economic recovery and higher interest rates. Considering that, the biggest appeal of utility-stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds may continue to be what has been the sector's main drawing point historically: high dividend yields over the long haul. 
Last year, utility funds were the weakest performers among 21 U.S.-stock categories tracked by Morningstar Inc., returning 18% (including price change and dividends) in a year when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned over 26%. The only utility funds that greatly outperformed the sector average benefited from nontraditional holdings. 
"We've had the sector [rated] at underperform since May, and we believe that will continue for at least the next few months," says Brad Sorensen, director of sector and market research at Charles Schwab Corp. "They're not that exciting." 
Of course, utility stocks have never been considered that exciting. Deregulation and the shooting star of energy-trading utilities such as Enron Corp. added some spice to the sector. 
And utilities funds had some appeal as defensive positions in the market debacle of 2008, posting an average return of negative 34%, better than many other types of stock funds and the S&P 500, which plunged 38%, according to Morningstar. But in general, utility stocks remain most attractive to conservative investors seeking a reliable income stream from high dividend yields. 
As of late December, the median yield of the 26 utilities funds followed by Morningstar was 2.9%, outpacing the 1.2% yield for large-company "blend" funds and the 2.3% yield of the S&P 500. 
With many expecting the U.S. economy to remain mired in slow growth for years to come, such modest investment objectives are starting to look more attractive to some. Indeed, Bill Gross, founder and co-chief investment officer of Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co., last month recommended that investors take a fresh look at utility stocks. 
"Their growth in earnings should mimic the U.S. economy as they always have, and most importantly, they yield 5-6%," Mr. Gross wrote in his monthly Investment Outlook. "In a low-growth environment, it seems to me that a company's stock should yield more than its less-risky debt, and many utilities provide just that opportunity." 
Most of the utilities funds that remained within hailing distance of the general market returns last year were those that branched out from U.S. electric utilities by adding more volatile stocks such as telecommunications providers and foreign utilities, a strategy that hurt them in 2008. 
Brazilian utilities are in the portfolios of MFS Utilities, up 33% in 2009, and Jennison Utility, which returned 28%. Many investors "got very concerned about emerging markets" in 2008, but "we felt very comfortable with Brazil as a country," says Shaun Hong, utilities portfolio manager for Jennison Associates. 
"You've got a growing region and some of the most rational regulation in the world in Brazil," says Maura Shaughnessy, manager of MFS Utilities. Among her favorites there is AES Eletropaulo, which has nearly six million customers in metropolitan Sao Paulo. 
Gabelli Utilities, meanwhile, favors domestic utilities but mainly those with disproportionate opportunities to benefit from the cutting edge of energy development. They include National Fuel Gas Co., a natural-gas utility in western New York. 
"It seems like a solid, low-risk utility," says Tim Winter, Gabelli & Co. utilities analyst, "but the exciting piece is that they own about 600,000 acres of reserves in the Marcellus Shale Formation in Pennsylvania that has huge potential for natural-gas development." Not only are the reserves enormous, but the technology has advanced to the point where it is economically feasible to extract gas from shale formations, he says. The fund gained 16% in 2009. 
Still, utilities funds can't ignore U.S.-based electric, diversified and gas utilities, and these frumpy domestic players can't quite outrun their past. 
"The core of the utilities category is still regulated electric and gas utilities, which are stable because they're regulated, and that's the nature of the beast," says David Kathman, a fund analyst at Morningstar. 
Investing in regulated utilities, however, isn't without risk. Some analysts say the potential for higher interest rates and the looming prospect of cap-and-trade legislation aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions may hurt the sector over the next few years. 
"We're a little concerned" about utilities funds' exposure to the factors holding down regulated electrical utilities, says Tom Roseen, a research manager at Lipper Inc., which says U.S. electric utilities account for about 30% of the average U.S. utilities-fund portfolio. 
Higher interest rates are of particular concern, says Don Linzer, managing director of Schneider Downs Wealth Management Advisors. Utilities tend to have a lot of debt because of construction requirements, so a rise in interest rates would increase those borrowing costs. And if bond yields rise, that increases the appeal to investors of bonds versus utilities stocks. 
"If you look out even in the short term, a couple of years, we think interest rates will be going up," Mr. Linzer says, "and if they do, typically the utility sector would be in an adverse position vis-a-vis other sectors." Utilities are second only to banks in their dependence on corporate borrowing, according to Lipper. 
Meanwhile, if the Obama administration and Congress impose a cap-and-trade system on the U.S. electric-utility industry, there will be big losers -- especially Midwestern utilities that burn lots of coal -- in addition to big winners -- those utilities that emphasize nuclear power. 
"Global warming is an overwhelming public-policy concern, and utilities are the big culprits there, so they have to invest in the infrastructure to address carbon -- and in new sources of renewable power," says Gabelli's Mr. Winter. 
Despite the risks, some utilities-fund managers see appeal in the classic electric utilities. 
John Kohli, manager of Franklin Utilities, up 14% last year, remains focused on opportunities in largely regulated companies. "What they're good at is putting poles and wires into the ground here, not investing in unrelated businesses or internationally or looking for outrageous returns on investment," he says. 
Utilities-fund investors, Mr. Kohli says, are looking for total returns with an emphasis on income through a high dividend yield, and some earnings potential beyond that. Yields on utility stocks are averaging 5%, he says. "Add that to 4% to 5% earnings growth, and that gets us close to a 10% total-return opportunity, which is right up these investors' alley," he says. 
While Mr. Kohli acknowledges his sector's lagging results last year, he says utilities outperformed the general market in each of the five years before 2009. Indeed, Mr. Kohli's fund may end up looking good again, Morningstar's Mr. Kathman says. "It's the epitome of a fund that focuses on traditional utilities," he says. "It has done well in up markets and down markets, and it has a pretty good record over the long term."

Abstract 
[...] methane represents only about 15% of the projects under the Kyoto Protocol's emissions offset program. Methane also forms ozone, the smog that severely damages food crops and kills tens of thousands each year by worsening asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases Captured methane gas can be used as a clean energy source, contributing to energy security and diversification as well as reducing damaging black carbon (soot) and CO2 emissions. 

Full Text 
This month's Copenhagen talks focused on the leading climate change culprit: carbon dioxide. But reversing global temperature increases by reducing carbon emissions will take many decades, if not centuries. Even if the largest cuts in CO2 contemplated in Copenhagen are implemented, it simply will not reverse the melting of ice already occurring in the most sensitive areas, including the rapid disappearance of glaciers in Tibet, the Arctic and Latin America. 
So what can we do to effectively buffer global warming? The most obvious strategy is to make an all-out effort to reduce emissions of methane. 
Sometimes called the "other greenhouse gas," methane is responsible for 75% as much warming as carbon dioxide measured over any given 20 years. Unlike carbon dioxide, which remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, methane lasts only a decade but packs a powerful punch while it's there. 
Methane's short life makes it especially interesting in the short run, given the pace of climate change. If we need to suppress temperature quickly in order to preserve glaciers, reducing methane can make an immediate impact. Compared to the massive requirements necessary to reduce CO2, cutting methane requires only modest investment. Where we stop methane emissions, cooling follows within a decade, not centuries. That could make the difference for many fragile systems on the brink. 
Yet global discussions about climate and policies to date have not focused on methane. Methane is formally in the "basket" of six gases targeted by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. But its value is counted as if it has the same lifetime as carbon dioxide. 
This ignores its much larger, near-term potential. As a result, methane represents only about 15% of the projects under the Kyoto Protocol's emissions offset program. And it is not a major focus of climate protection programs in any nation. 
This is huge missed opportunity, and not just for the climate. Methane also forms ozone, the smog that severely damages food crops and kills tens of thousands each year by worsening asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases 
Captured methane gas can be used as a clean energy source, contributing to energy security and diversification as well as reducing damaging black carbon (soot) and CO2 emissions. Solving the methane problem will lead to a higher quality of life by cleaning up city and agricultural wastes and odors, and curbing air pollution from dirty stoves and local industries. It will also create local jobs in construction and operation of methane-abating equipment. 
Methane comes from a variety of sources: landfills, sewage streams, coal mines, oil and gas drilling operations, agricultural wastes, and cattle farms. For most of these sources, relatively cheap "end of pipe" technologies are available to collect methane and convert it to useful energy rather than venting it to the atmosphere. 
These technologies include drilling into coal seams before mining to release and collect methane (this also reduces the risk of mine explosions, which kill hundreds of miners per year); depositing manure into "biogas" digesting tanks where pipes collect methane produced from decomposition; and covering and lining open landfills, shunting methane into a collection pipe. 
In most cases, the collected methane can be used to run a village- or city-scale power plant. The Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimate that as much as 40% of the world's projected methane could be reduced at less than $60 dollars per ton of carbon equivalent. Some methane projects even have "negative" cost, as the value of the captured gas exceeds the investment. 
Experience has shown that even with modest incentives, methane projects, which are typically small scale, can move fast. Timberline Energy, a U.S. company, reports an expected construction time of six to eight months for landfill gas projects once financing is secured. And the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism estimates that setting up biogas projects can take as little as five months. Hundreds of shovel-ready projects around the world are ready to go, but are stalled because of uncertainty over future carbon rules. 
This is why on Dec. 11, along with a distinguished group of colleagues from the scientific and financial communities, we proposed the creation of a Global Methane Fund to address the specific measures needed to get methane projects off the ground now. This includes a guaranteed price floor for methane projects to allay uncertainty over future carbon prices. 
Funded by governments and private foundations, a Global Methane Fund with only $100 million to $200 million could leverage tens of billions of dollars for other projects, which will have a quick and measurable cooling effect in the Arctic and elsewhere. Scientific studies, such as the EPA's June 2006 report, "Global Mitigation of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases," conservatively indicate that we could eliminate 1.3 gigatons of annual CO2 equivalent emissions -- that's half the U.S. power industry's emissions -- just by targeting landfills, coal mines, and oil and gas leaks. 
Such a fund would benefit melting glaciers in the Arctic, and in the Andean and Himalayan mountains. And it would demonstrate to the world that we can do something to quickly slow climate change. 
We need to get moving to cool the planet's temperature. Methane is the most effective place for us to start.

Abstract 
The amendment will force powerful state-owned electric grid companies, responsible for distributing electricity from power plants, to buy all the electricity generated from renewable sources even when it is more expensive and more complicated to use than electricity from coal-fired plants. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- China announced new regulations to increase the use of renewable energy such as wind and hydropower by forcing electricity-grid operators to prioritize their use, in a bid by the world's top greenhouse-gas emitter to reduce its reliance on coal. 
The new measures were passed Saturday by the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, as an amendment to the 2006 renewable-energy law, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The amendment will force powerful state-owned electric grid companies, responsible for distributing electricity from power plants, to buy all the electricity generated from renewable sources even when it is more expensive and more complicated to use than electricity from coal-fired plants. 
The new legislation "contributes to the global fight on climate change," said Wang Zhongying, director of the renewable-energy center under a think tank affiliated with China's National Development and Reform Commission, according to Xinhua. 
Coal currently accounts for 70% of China's total energy use. China wants to increase use of renewable-energy sources to 15% of its total by 2020, up from 9% last year. The goal is related to a separate target announced by top leader Hu Jintao last month ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit to reduce China's carbon emissions relative to economic output by 40% to 45% from 2005 levels by 2020. The absolute levels of emissions will continue to grow, however, as China's economy expands. 
The government's efforts have encouraged a boom in renewable-energy development in China that has added more generation capacity than China's electricity grid has been using. That has left between a quarter and a third of China's wind farms stranded. 
Other countries that are promoting renewable energy have similar laws in place. Still, China faces difficulties implementing it. China's electricity-grid operators need to develop a smarter network to handle how to dispatch electricity generated by wind or solar energy, which fluctuates widely depending on weather patterns, and to relate it to demand for power, which swings in different cycles. 
The new rules come as China continues to trade barbs over its role at the Copenhagen summit, which ended Dec. 18 with an accord widely labeled a disappointment. Some foreign officials, including Britain's climate-change secretary Ed Miliband, have charged that Beijing's intransigence was responsible for the meeting's failure to reach a global deal to strongly cut emissions. 
China has fired back, with state media running articles trumpeting the contributions of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who attended the summit. Chinese consular officials in the U.S., reflecting the Chinese government's increasingly assertive public-relations tactics, last week forwarded some of that coverage to U.S. journalists. 
The Xinhua article they forwarded portrays Mr. Wen as a hero at Copenhagen, struggling to protect the interests of poor nations and shocked by the rudeness of others toward China as he tried to reach a last-minute consensus.

Corrections & Amplifications 
The first name of Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was misspelled as Rob in a front-page article Thursday about tea and politics. 
(WSJ December 26, 2009) 
LEXINGTON, Ky. -- There are two tea-party movements in America. One favors low taxes, small government and patriotic feeling. The other favors fine china, orange pekoe and 

cordial chitchat. 

The two have coexisted uneasily since Dec. 16, 1773, when antitax demonstrators dumped 342 chests of quite drinkable tea into Boston Harbor. Lately, tea dumpers have 
touched off a raucous revival. But tea sippers, enjoying a genteel revival of their own, aren't showing the dumpers much sympathy. 
"I'm promoting tea parties -- just not that kind of tea party," says Bruce Richardson, who lives in Perryville, a village 45 miles southwest of here. For a living, he imports tea, 

publishes books about tea and teaches tea-brewing and tea-party proprieties. 
Mr. Richardson wishes that tea-party politics were more polite, and also that tea could shake its rebellious associations. 
"Tea is the communal cup of the world," Mr. Richardson says. Yet he has just brought out a book called "Tea & Etiquette" in which tea-expert James Norwood Pratt suggests that 

the incident in Boston 236 years ago gave Americans "a prenatal disinclination for tea." 

Chic as it now may be, tea connoisseurship has been slow to charm the masses. The market for the kind of tea that sells for $4 an ounce has quadrupled in the past decade. 
Average Americans, though, still put away nine pounds of coffee a year, against seven ounces of tea -- most of it iced, bottled, bagged or instant. 
Traveling the country for fine-tea seminars, Mr. Richardson carries his own loose tea, pot and electric kettle. In restaurants, he is rarely served tea the way he likes it, and rarely 

misses a chance to offer a brewing lesson. 

Nothing ruffles him more than lukewarm water served in a cup with a tea bag on the side. That's how Mica Sims usually serves hot tea at Bar None, a place she and her 
husband run here in Lexington. 
When she hears of Mr. Richardson's criticism, she says, "Bring him up here. Tell him to bring some of his tea." Ms. Sims is a tea-party promoter herself -- the other kind of tea 

party. 

"People are talking, hey, no more taxes, no more spending, pay attention, let's do something," she was saying one Tuesday evening, as a few dozen tea-party veterans pushed 
tables into a row in her dining area for a political get-together. 
She was holding a plastic bottle labeled "Talking Rain Twist Organic Mandarin White Tea." "I thought it was water," said Ms. Sims. 
She is 25 years old, and a Kentucky tea-party luminary. Last January, "watching politics" while caring for her year-old daughter at home, she started a blog. 
On tax day in April, she organized two tea-party protests and has since been offered her own radio talk show. Meanwhile, she opened the sports bar. It has all the usual 

attractions -- videogames, framed basketball shirts -- but no alcohol. 
Seated across from Ms. Sims, David Adams was fiddling with a BlackBerry and drinking water. Mr. Adams manages the U.S. Senate campaign of Republican conservative Rand 

Paul, the son of Rep. Rob Paul (R., Texas), and has no taste for tea. "I'm out there throwing it overboard," he said. "We Americans are different from the English," said Paul 
Hunt, drinking coffee. "It all started in 1773. Us against Earl Grey." 
A waiter did set a mug of hot black tea in front of Gatewood Galbraith, Kentucky's well-known contrarian libertarian. Asked how it was prepared, the waiter said, "Out of a 

bottle." 
Tea-party activists do imbibe the stuff. They also dump it on politicians. A local radio host, Leland Conway, collected 14,000 tea bags from listeners and delivered them in July to 
Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat. "That's a lot of tea," he says. "That stimulated the tea economy." 

At home in Perryville, Mr. Richardson was shocked. "I don't think their hearts are in it," he said. "If they were serious, they wouldn't be using cheap tea bags. They'd be using loose tea. Anybody can buy cheap tea bags for a protest." 
He and his wife, Shelley, who are both 56, were studying music at a Baptist seminary when they met. Mr. Richardson was a choirmaster for 22 years until he came to feel that his church had moved too far right for his taste. The couple bought an old, porticoed mansion, fastidiously restored it, and opened it to the public as a temple of afternoon tea. 
"The message is serenity," Mr. Richardson said as water in a kettle came to a boil in his kitchen. He spooned Tippy Assam into a pot, brought pot to kettle (not kettle to pot) and let the tea steep. 
"Coffee is grab and go," Mrs. Richardson said, holding out a cup as her husband poured. "Tea takes time." Pouring for himself, he said, "A lot of Americans have no idea how to even start making tea. You need to calm down. Think. Tea makes you less dogmatic." 
It was a rainy Wednesday, and Mr. Richardson had to drive to Lexington to sign copies of his etiquette book at a mall. Taking up the invitation from Ms. Sims for some instruction in the art of brewing, he stopped in at Bar None for a tea party. 
"I'm on board with you," she said, greeting him. "People want something warm and comforting." All smiles, she led him to a table and said, "I'll get what we have," when he asked to see her tea selection. She returned with a few bottles and a basket of bags: Sweet Dreams, Mint Medley. . . . 
Mr. Richardson took out a container of green Hyson that he packages under the label, "Tea Thrown Into Boston Harbor." Ms. Sims said she knew it wasn't the "exact" tea, and asked how to brew it. 
"In a pot," said Mr. Richardson. She had none. A waiter brought water in cups. Mr. Richardson filled "roll-your-own" tea bags and showed Ms. Sims his steeping technique. Jiggling was unwise, he told her, and squeezing forbidden. "I understand," she said. "Not elegant." 
They raised their cups, and the chat drifted from babies and jobs to tea-party politics. "I wish we could be more inclusive," Ms. Sims said. Mr. Richardson acknowledged that Mr. Obama may have breached diplomatic protocol when he shook hands and bowed to the emperor of Japan at the same time. He added: "You and I can both agree that we can sit down over a cup of tea and walk away appreciating each other's passions." 
Escorting him to the door, the tea party over, Ms. Sims said something about the importance of Kentucky's coal industry, and Mr. Richardson said something about his fear of global warming. Ms. Sims stopped and said, "Oh! You just lost me!" 
"What? You think there's a conspiracy?" he said. 
"Global warming's a farce," said Ms. Sims. She folded her arms and said goodbye to Mr. Richardson with a strained smile. 
Late for his book signing, he hurried across the street to his car. "This tea-party thing isn't doing tea any good," Mr. Richardson said before driving away. "It's a conspiracy of the coffee people. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it."

Abstract 
Without a carbon cost, coal-fired generators selling into wholesale markets where natural gas-fired plants set the marginal price of electricity tend to earn good profit margins per megawatt-hour. 

Full Text 
[Financial Analysis and Commentary] 
In Copenhagen, world leaders debated climate change they didn't quite believe in enough to overcome political obstacles. What does their lack of agreement portend for the 
U.S. electricity sector? 
In short: more uncertainty. When and how America handles carbon emissions affects every power company's investment decisions and valuation. 
Selling even a multilateral settlement looked challenging. Legislation ahead of 2010 midterm elections now seems all but impossible. Having the Environmental Protection Agency regulate carbon emissions as pollutants instead would provoke legal challenges. 
The big losers are nuclear generators like Exelon and Entergy. Nuclear plants emit no carbon. If carbon was embedded in electricity prices, as generators using fossil fuels factored it into costs, nuclear profits would benefit. 
Conversely, unregulated power producers burning coal benefit from a delay. How much, depends on their regional market. Without a carbon cost, coal-fired generators selling into wholesale markets where natural gas-fired plants set the marginal price of electricity tend to earn good profit margins per megawatt-hour. 
Carbon pricing would savage such margins -- that's the idea, after all. But in its absence, it might be time to reappraise Allegheny Energy, the worst-performing S&P Utilities constituent this year. As Morgan Stanley points out, its unregulated generation portfolio is mainly coal-fired, operating where gas-fired competitors set prices. At 11 times 2009 earnings versus a sector average of 13.4 times, Allegheny appears priced for change that Copenhagen didn't deliver.

Abstract 
Ms. Jiang said China urged developed countries to "fulfill their obligations to developing countries in an earnest way, and stay away from activities that hinder the international community's cooperation in coping with climate change." Because the U.S., China and other major economies didn't agree to binding emissions cuts, European countries didn't increase their own pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. 

Full text 
The failure of the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen to produce a strong, binding agreement to cut carbon-dioxide emissions sowed gloom in European carbon markets Monday, with prices for carbon-emissions permits falling more than 8%. 
There were also political echoes to the Copenhagen summit's acrimonious conclusion. Some senior officials, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and British climate-change secretary Ed Miliband, criticized the current U.N. framework for addressing climate change, which requires consensus among more than 190 countries. 
"Never again should we face the deadlock that threatened to pull down those talks," Mr. Brown said Monday. "Never again should we let a global deal to move towards a greener future be held to ransom by only a handful of countries." 
The slumping price for carbon reflected disappointment among traders and businesses that the nonbinding Copenhagen Accord didn't stipulate how much big countries such as the U.S. or China have to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. The deal also left unresolved most of the big issues of how to curb emissions linked to climate change. On Tuesday, China's Xinhua news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu, taking issue with British complaints about the summit and China's role. 
Ms. Jiang said China urged developed countries to "fulfill their obligations to developing countries in an earnest way, and stay away from activities that hinder the international community's cooperation in coping with climate change." 
Because the U.S., China and other major economies didn't agree to binding emissions cuts, European countries didn't increase their own pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. European officials, who had considered curbing emissions by 30% from 1990 levels, instead maintained their target of a 20% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020. 
That helped push prices for carbon permits to 12.41 euros ($17.73) per metric ton Monday, down from 13.58 euros Friday. Carbon-permit prices have fallen 14% since the beginning of the Copenhagen conference, a reflection of how expectations steadily fell as countries bickered over how much they would cut emissions and who would pay for it. 
The European Union's emissions-trading plan caps the amount of greenhouse gases that power companies and the like can emit. They can purchase carbon permits on the market in order to comply with emissions limits. 
Investors in low-carbon or no-carbon energy technology, such as solar panels, wind turbines and nuclear power, say the prices for carbon permits must be much higher than current levels -- in some cases, as much as <euro>60 a ton -- to make their systems cost-competitive with coal, oil or natural gas. 
The two-week Copenhagen conference appeared set to end with no agreement at all, until last-minute bargaining among leaders from the U.S., China, Brazil, India and South Africa produced a final statement. A handful of countries, including Sudan, Venezuela and Bolivia, declined to endorse the 11th-hour deal. 
Many analysts said the problems evidenced in Copenhagen could spell the decline of the U.N. approach to tackling climate change, which has been in operation since 1992 and has prioritized global accord. Instead, they expect the rise of international climate negotiations among smaller groups of countries. 
"The end game in Copenhagen was symbolic of the conference's broader procedural failings," says Michael Levi, director of energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Time for a Climate Change Plan B

Abstract 
The overriding priority for the developing world has to be the fastest feasible rate of economic development, which means, inter alia, using the cheapest available source of energy: carbon energy. 

Full Text 
The world's political leaders, not least President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, are in a state of severe, almost clinical, denial. While acknowledging that the outcome of the United Nations climate-change conference in Copenhagen fell short of their demand for a legally binding, enforceable and verifiable global agreement on emissions reductions by developed and developing countries alike, they insist that what has been achieved is a breakthrough and a decisive step forward. 
Just one more heave, just one more venue for the great climate-change traveling circus -- Mexico City next year -- and the job will be done. 
Or so we are told. It is, of course, the purest nonsense. The only breakthrough was the political coup for China and India in concluding the anodyne communique with the United States behind closed doors, with Brazil and South Africa allowed in the room and Europe left to languish in the cold outside. 
Far from achieving a major step forward, Copenhagen -- predictably -- achieved precisely nothing. The nearest thing to a commitment was the promise by the developed world to pay the developing world $30 billion of "climate aid" over the next three years, rising to $100 billion a year from 2020. Not only is that (perhaps fortunately) not legally binding, but there is no agreement whatsoever about which countries it will go to, in which amounts, and on what conditions. 
The reasons for the complete and utter failure of Copenhagen are both fundamental and irresolvable. The first is that the economic cost of decarbonizing the world's economies is massive, and of at least the same order of magnitude as any benefits it may conceivably bring in terms of a cooler world in the next century. 
The reason we use carbon-based energy is not the political power of the oil lobby or the coal industry. It is because it is far and away the cheapest source of energy at the present time and is likely to remain so, not forever, but for the foreseeable future. 
Switching to much more expensive energy may be acceptable to us in the developed world (although I see no present evidence of this). But in the developing world, including the rapidly developing nations such as China and India, there are still tens if not hundreds of millions of people suffering from acute poverty, and from the consequences of such poverty, in the shape of malnutrition, preventable disease and premature death. 
The overriding priority for the developing world has to be the fastest feasible rate of economic development, which means, inter alia, using the cheapest available source of energy: carbon energy. 
Moreover, the argument that they should make this economic and human sacrifice to benefit future generations 100 years and more hence is all the less compelling, given that these future generations will, despite any problems caused by warming, be many times better off than the people of the developing world are today. 
Or, at least, that is the assumption on which the climate scientists' warming projections are based. It is projected economic growth that determines projected carbon emissions, and projected carbon emissions that (according to the somewhat conjectural computer models on which they rely) determine projected warming (according to the same models). 
All this overlaps with the second of the two fundamental reasons why Copenhagen failed, and why Mexico City (if our leaders insist on continuing this futile charade) will fail, too. That is the problem of burden-sharing, and in particular how much of the economic cost of decarbonization should be borne by the developed world, which accounts for the bulk of past emissions, and how much by the faster-growing developing world, which will account for the bulk of future emissions. 
The 2006 Stern Review, quite the shoddiest pseudo-scientific and pseudo-economic document any British Government has ever produced, claims the overall burden is very small. If that were so, the problem of how to share the burden would be readily overcome -- as indeed occurred with the phasing out of chorofluorocarbons (CFCs) under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. But the true cost of decarbonization is massive, and the distribution of the burden an insoluble problem. 
Moreover, any assessment of the impact of any future warming that may occur is inevitably highly conjectural, depending as it does not only on the uncertainties of climate science but also on the uncertainties of future technological development. So what we are talking about is risk. 
Not that the risk is all one way. The risk of a 1930s-style outbreak of protectionism -- if the developed world were to abjure cheap energy and faced enhanced competition from China and other rapidly industrializing countries that declined to do so -- is probably greater than any risk from warming. 
But even without that, there is not even a theoretical (let alone a practical) basis for a global agreement on burden-sharing, since, so far as the risk of global warming is concerned (and probably in other areas too) risk aversion is not uniform throughout the world. Not only do different cultures embody very different degrees of risk aversion, but in general the richer countries will tend to be more risk-averse than the poorer countries, if only because we have more to lose. 
The time has come to abandon the Kyoto-style folly that reached its apotheosis in Copenhagen last week, and move to plan B. 
And the outlines of a credible plan B are clear. First and foremost, we must do what mankind has always done, and adapt to whatever changes in temperature may in the future arise. 
This enables us to pocket the benefits of any warming (and there are many) while reducing the costs. None of the projected costs are new phenomena, but the possible exacerbation of problems our climate already throws at us. Addressing these problems directly is many times more cost-effective than anything discussed at Copenhagen. And adaptation does not require a global agreement, although we may well need to help the very poorest countries (not China) to adapt. 
Beyond adaptation, plan B should involve a relatively modest, increased government investment in technological research and development -- in energy, in adaptation and in geoengineering. 
Despite the overwhelming evidence of the Copenhagen debacle, it is not going to be easy to get our leaders to move to plan B. There is no doubt that calling a halt to the high-profile climate-change traveling circus risks causing a severe conference-deprivation trauma among the participants. If there has to be a small public investment in counseling, it would be money well spent.

Abstract 
"If we'd had bankable emissions reduction targets for 2020, it would have given a stronger price signal for carbon," said Joan McNaughton, senior vice president, Power and Environment Policies, at Alstom Power SA, an engineering company which is a leader in clean coal. 

Full Text 
The agreement achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit leaves business leaders around the world close to where they began, facing uncertainty about how environmental policy will affect their costs and decisions about investments. 
Companies around the world had hoped the United Nations-sponsored talks would bring clarity on the new rules of the game in a new low-carbon world. They have had to think again. 
"It's very frustrating at this stage that we haven't got a more-comprehensive agreement," said Richard Gledhill, head of carbon markets at PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Much of the business elite in rich countries has already resigned itself to tighter restrictions on greenhouse gases. Companies in energy-intensive industries are already mapping out plans to drive down their emissions. Utility executives in the U.S. have been pouring money into lower-carbon technologies. 
A legally-binding treaty on emission cuts would have created a level playing field for clean energy, allowing it to compete on an equal footing with fossil fuels. No such deal emerged from the summit. 
"If we'd had bankable emissions reduction targets for 2020, it would have given a stronger price signal for carbon," said Joan McNaughton, senior vice president, Power and Environment Policies, at Alstom Power SA, an engineering company which is a leader in clean coal. "That would have kick-started a lot of the needed investment in clean technology." 
Advocates of cap-and-trade -- which lies at the heart of climate legislation now stuck in the U.S. Senate -- dream of a global network of emissions-trading systems that could one day link up. In their view that would give industry what it needs to make decisions about long-term investments -- a robust and stable price of carbon. But Copenhagen has set back those hopes. 
Carbon trading is in its infancy. Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme is the world's largest market. If the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter after China, sets up its own system, that could help boost the global carbon market to $1.9 trillion by 2020, says New Carbon Finance, a London-based research firm. 
But regulatory uncertainty in sectors like power generation has driven down the carbon price on Europe market, and it had its biggest fall in six months on Thursday -- nearly 5% -- and stayed at that level Friday. 
"We were hoping that a deal in Copenhagen would open up new opportunities for emssions trading," said Patrick Birley, head of the European Climate Exchange, one of Europe's main carbon marketplaces. That expectation has now faded, he says. 
Some analysts think Friday's events could still stimulate carbon trading. Friday's deal "has somewhat of a market-stabilizing element," said Ben Feldman, an executive director in J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s environmental markets group. He said it indicates a commitment to the concept of emission reductions. 
In recent months, utilities, oil and gas companies in North America have become more active in carbon offsets, even on a voluntary basis. In the third quarter, U.S. carbon-trading volume increased 8% from the second quarter in spite of falling prices, New Carbon Finance says. 
"Even with Copenhagen not really coming up with any major, ground-breaking decisions, everyone realizes that some sort of climate action is coming, and they are trying to learn the market," said Anthony D'Agostino, director of emissions markets at Royal Bank of Canada. 
In the clean-technology industry, executives said they weren't counting on a deal at Copenhagen. They said companies have been making investments in low-carbon technologies on their own, driven by factors like the rising cost of traditional power and increased subsidies for alternative energy at the state and local level. 
"Copenhagen is important to help drive awareness of the issues, but the private sector has not been waiting for governments for solutions," said Dallas Kachan, managing director of the Cleantech Group, a market research firm in San Francisco. "They have been putting money into this for a long time." 
With or without a strong Copenhagen agreement, many U.S. states will continue to shift toward lower-carbon fuels, said Michael Peevey, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates investor-owned electric, gas and water utilities in the state. 
"California will continue on the path it's on, regardless," Mr. Peevey said.

Abstract 
[...] a big chunk of the U.K.'s electricity-generation capacity will disappear over the next decade, as high-emitting coal-fired power stations and older nuclear reactors are shut. 

Full Text 
As nations debate sweeping carbon-emission cuts in Copenhagen, one country has become a model of ambitious targets -- the U.K. Whether it has the right system in place to achieve those goals is another matter. 
Britain has one of the most open, competitive energy markets in Europe. Its system has delivered real benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices for electricity and gas. But there is growing skepticism that the U.K. will be able to hit its target of a 34% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020 -- and 80% by 2050 -- with the kind of deregulated, liberalized energy system it currently has in place. 
The problem: It's still cheaper for U.K. power providers to entice consumers with inexpensive energy generated by dirtier technologies such as gas-fired power plants than through cleaner means such as nuclear or wind power. Critics of the government say Britain hasn't yet come up with a financial framework that adequately encourages construction of cleaner plants. 
Many Western governments have championed energy deregulation, even as they face doubts about whether decarbonizing an economy can be left to the market. A recent report by the U.K.'s Committee on Climate Change, or CCC, an independent body advising the government, said it was unsure the market in its current form "will deliver required investments in low-carbon [power] generation" through the 2020s. 
"You can't be confident that arrangements designed to deliver the efficient dispatch of a fossil-fuel fired plant can deliver a totally different objective" of big investment in nuclear and renewables, says David Kennedy, the CCC's chief executive. 
The U.K.'s record in reducing emissions leaves room for improvement. The CCC says they fell at less than 1% annually from 2003 to 2007, and will need to fall at 2% a year for the U.K. to meet its targets. The government says Britain's greenhouse gases have come down by more than 20% from 1990 levels and that it is on track to meet its goal of a 34% reduction by 2020. 
The U.K. broke up and privatized its electricity monopoly in the 1980s and 1990s, and removed controls on prices. But a big chunk of the U.K.'s electricity-generation capacity will disappear over the next decade, as high-emitting coal-fired power stations and older nuclear reactors are shut. What replaces them will have huge implications for the U.K.'s ability to keep to its carbon targets. 
In theory, the price of carbon should dictate decisions on such investments. The European Union's emissions-trading plan sets an overall cap on the output of greenhouse gases. The price of permits to emit CO2 then creates incentives to cut emissions and invest in low-carbon technology. 
But the recession triggered a steep fall in the price of carbon in the EU trading system, and it has languished at about 13 euros ($18.90) a ton for months, down from around 30 euros in the summer of 2008. The result: the economics of capital-intensive projects like offshore wind farms still don't add up. 
Instead, companies tend to opt for gas-fired power stations, which are cheap, quick and easy to build. But burning more of the fossil fuel means the U.K. may miss its emissions target. 
Sam Laidlaw, head of utility Centrica PLC, has called for a support mechanism to be activated if the price of carbon in the emission-trading system fell below a certain floor. This would provide the certainty companies need to make investment decisions, he says. 
Others advocate tougher state intervention. Even the opposition Conservatives say they are looking at ways of supporting the carbon price. From the party that drove through the privatization of the U.K.'s energy sector, that is a big change.

Abstract 
The FutureGen project would use coal gasification, whereby heat and pressure are applied to coal instead of burning it, creating a synthetic gas that fuels turbines to generate electricity. 

Full Text 
The global race to take a lead in the development of "clean coal" technology is wide open as prospects for the U.S. government's erstwhile flagship project in Illinois remain murky. 
"It's going to be interesting to see which country gets under way first," said John Novak, the executive director for federal and industrial activities at the Electric Power Research Institute, at an international climate summit last week. 
Developing a commercially viable means of capturing and storing the greenhouse-gas emissions from burning coal is seen by many as a vital -- and politically expedient -- way to limit climate change, a giant task under discussion at the United Nations summit in Copenhagen. The Obama administration has promised to decide in coming months whether to subsidize the first-of-its-kind "clean coal" power plant called FutureGen. 
The decision on the project, which was already brought back from the dead once before, will signal the size of the U.S. government's ambitions in the global race to develop low-emissions use of coal, a fuel on which the world's top emitters, the U.S. and China, are heavily reliant. Companies developing the technology are ambivalent about government involvement. 
"On the one hand you badly want and need the stimulus and endorsing effect that only the government can bring," said Albert Lin, a director with Future Fuels LLC, a privately held company that is pursuing its own U.S. project based on technology licensed from China. "The problem is political conflict and changes in administration priorities could make a project that looks like it was going along fine grind to a halt." 
The Bush administration pulled the plug on the FutureGen Alliance project in early 2008, citing a surge in construction costs following an economic boom. The Obama administration promised to revive the Mattoon, Ill., project with just over $1 billion in funding, as long as enough new members agreed to additional contributions. So far, the new members have yet to sign on, while the nation's biggest coal-burning utilities dropped out of the alliance. American Electric Power Co. and Southern Co. left this year. Duke Energy Co., which was a member in an earlier incarnation, is pursuing its own plans for a project similar to FutureGen. The on-again, off-again U.S. government commitment comes as a handful of competitors in China, Australia and from within the U.S. has emerged. FutureGen now faces a deadline of early 2010 to sign up enough new members to secure the funding needed to lock in the Energy Department grant. 
The FutureGen project would use coal gasification, whereby heat and pressure are applied to coal instead of burning it, creating a synthetic gas that fuels turbines to generate electricity. The process produces less carbon dioxide than conventional coal-burning power plants. 
"Nobody has done it where they have paired gasification with carbon capture and then storage," said an Energy Department spokesman. 
The Obama administration has been hedging its "clean coal" bet. The Department of Energy recently handed out almost $1 billion, with two-thirds going to American Electric Power and Southern, to retrofit older coal-fired power plants with devices to capture and sequester carbon dioxide. The DOE decided against giving money to Future Fuels or Duke for more ambitious projects that would combine newer coal gasification with carbon-capture technology. 
The $334 million that went to American Electric Power to expand a carbon capture and storage project at its Mountaineer plant in West Virginia may add incentives for the company to focus on retrofits.

Abstract 
China's vast market and economies of scale are bringing down the cost of solar and wind energy, as well as other environmentally friendly technologies such as electric car batteries. According to U.S. government projections, world coal use could increase nearly 50% by 2030. 

Full Text 
Corrections & Amplifications 
BP PLC's solar unit has partially closed a Maryland plant. A Dec. 15 front-page article about alternative energy in China incorrectly said BP Solar was stopping all output at its Maryland facility. 
(WSJ Jan. 6, 2010) 
BEIJING -- Xu Shisen put down the phone and smiled. That was Canada calling, explained the chief engineer at a coal-fired power plant set among knockoff antique and art shops in a Beijing suburb. A Canadian company is interested in Mr. Xu's advances in bringing down the cost of stripping out greenhouse-gas emissions from burning coal. 
Engineers led by Mr. Xu are working to unlock one of climate change's thorniest problems: how to burn coal without releasing carbon into the atmosphere. 
Mr. Xu is part of a broader effort by China to introduce green technology to the world's fastest-growing industrial economy -- a mission so ambitious it could eventually reshape the business, just as China has done for everything from construction cranes to computers. 
China looms large over the global climate summit in Copenhagen, where Chinese officials are pressing the U.S. and other rich nations to accept new curbs on their emissions and to continue to subsidize poor nations' efforts to adopt clean-energy technology. China is the world's biggest source of carbon emissions. Less understood is the way China is now becoming a source of some of the solutions. 
China's vast market and economies of scale are bringing down the cost of solar and wind energy, as well as other environmentally friendly technologies such as electric car batteries. That could help address a major impediment to wide adoption of such technologies: They need heavy subsidies to be economical. 
The so-called China price -- the combination of cheap labor and capital that rewrote the rulebook on manufacturing -- is spreading to green technology. "The China price will move into the renewable-energy space, specifically for energy that relies on capital-intensive projects," says Jonathan Woetzel, a director in McKinsey & Co.'s China office. 
China's government is backing the trend. It wants to replicate the success of the special economic zones that transformed cities such as Shenzhen from a fishing village near Hong Kong into one of the biggest manufacturing export centers in the world. Set up when China began its economic reforms in the 1980s, the zones were designed to attract foreign investment into light manufacturing to kick-start exports. They became engines of China's economic boom. 
Regulators will announce several low carbon centers next year that will have preferential policies to promote low carbon manufacturing and exports. 
China's goals face big challenges. China could end up becoming simply a low-cost manufacturing base, not a source of innovation. Worse, its drive to cut costs could stifle innovation overseas. 
And Beijing has a long way to go to reducing China's carbon footprint. For each out-of-date power plant it shut down in a two-year cleanup campaign, it added the capacity of roughly two more. Even some of the better power plants are run poorly because company bosses don't want to pay to clean up their emissions. 
In the fight against global warming, some of the biggest gains are to be made in scrubbing carbon from coal-burning power plants. China and the U.S. together have 44% of the world's coal reserves, and aren't about to give up on the cheap and reliable source of power. According to U.S. government projections, world coal use could increase nearly 50% by 2030. 
"If emissions aren't reduced from power plants, global warming cannot be avoided," says Jonathan Lewis, a climate specialist at the U.S.-based Clean Air Task Force, which has sought to pair U.S. utilities with Chinese companies. "The solution can be led by the U.S. and China." 
Capture technology traps carbon dioxide gasses released by coal plants. The gas can be pumped deep underground, typically into salt caverns or aging oil fields. The carbon can be stripped either before or after the coal is burned. Post-combustion capture is simpler and can be retrofitted on existing power plants. Current versions cut energy output by a fifth or more. 
Far more complicated is precombustion carbon capture, which involves completely redesigning plants. Coal is turned into a gas, the carbon is stripped out and the rest is burned. Called "integrated gasification combined cycle" plants, these cost billions of dollars and haven't been developed on a commercial scale yet. 
China has a technological lead in turning coal into gas. It has been using the technology widely to make petrochemicals and fertilizers as a substitute for pricier natural gas. Houston-based Future Fuels LLC has licensed gasification technology from China to use in a plant in Pennsylvania. 
Critics say current carbon capture technologies are merely a Band-Aid for global warming. That's because they're so inefficient that even more coal has to be burned to produce the same amount of electricity. Also, the technology uses a lot of water and sequestering carbon underground isn't proven. 
Still, some analysts estimate carbon capture could account for between 15% to 55% of the world's cumulative carbon emissions reduction by 2100. 
Among those leading the ramp-up is Mr. Xu. These days, he is busy with three clean coal projects. One is on the outskirts of Beijing, underneath looming cooling towers of the 
Gaobeidian Huaneng power plant. 

Mr. Xu and colleagues work at a state-run research institute partly owned by China Huaneng Group, China's biggest utility. The state-owned giant produces about 10% of 

China's electricity, nearly all from coal. 
The Beijing project, started before the 2008 Summer Olympics, traps a fraction of the carbon dioxide emitted by the plant, purifying and selling it for use in food packaging and 
for the fizz in sodas. Using what he's learned in Beijing, Mr. Xu is building another capture facility in Shanghai that will be 30 times bigger. 

If Mr. Xu's team can figure out how to bring the costs down -- mostly by recycling energy lost in the process of scrubbing out the carbon -- these units could be retrofitted to 

coal-fired power plants around the world. 
Mr. Xu is also involved in the GreenGen project, a $1 billion power plant led by Huaneng that will turn coal into a gas before burning it. The project is scheduled to go online by 
2011. Burning gas is more efficient than burning coal -- meaning less coal is required to make the same amount of electricity. The less coal burned, the less carbon released. 

Though carbon capture has moved into the mainstream, it is still at least five to 10 years away from becoming a widespread technology, analysts say. 
In the meantime, China is reshaping two of the biggest green technologies in use already -- wind and solar power. 
In 2004, foreign firms owned 80% of China's wind-turbine market, according to energy consulting firm IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Now, Chinese companies 

own three-quarters of the country's market, thanks to companies which make turbines a third cheaper than European competitors. 

Chinese wind-turbine makers are starting to export. In October, Shenyang Power Group struck a deal to supply 240 turbines to one of the largest wind-farm projects in the U.S., 
a 36,000-acre development in Texas. 
China already has a 30% share of the global market for photovoltaic solar panels used to generate electricity. Solar-power panel makers, including Suntech Power Holdings Co., 

Yingli Green Energy and Trina Solar Ltd., export most of their product to Europe and the U.S., contributing to a 30% drop in world solar-power prices. 

Chinese competition is forcing rivals to shift production. U.S. Evergreen Solar Inc. said it will move its assembly line from Massachusetts to China. General Electric Co. said it will 
shut a facility in Delaware. BP PLC's solar unit said this spring it would stop output in Maryland and rely on Chinese suppliers instead. 
Yet, despite China's armies of fresh engineering graduates, foreign companies still create and own most of the key technologies. "China lags about 10 years behind in 

technology," says Bernice Lee, a research director at Chatham House, a London-based think tank that analyzed patent holders on renewable and low-carbon technology. 

As in other industries, China's cheap manufacturing may spark protectionism. In one hint of battles to come, Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to the U.S. energy 
secretary protesting the use of federal stimulus money to support the $1.5 billion wind project in Texas unless it relies on U.S.-built turbines. 
Critics in rich countries accuse China of unfairly subsidizing companies via cheap loans from state-controlled banks and dumping excess supply overseas. 
Others say China's missteps could hurt the market for all. "China is making prices cheaper in renewables today, by lunging into oversupply, as it does in most industries," says 

Daniel Rosen, principal of consulting firm Rhodium Group. "The question -- and danger -- is whether by oversupplying the market today China is damaging longer-term 

innovation and competition in the sector for the future." 
In green technology, China has figured out ways to turn excess capacity to its advantage. Until this year, China's solar-panel makers exported nearly all their output to countries 
such as Germany and Spain, where government supported growth in the sector. 

That changed this year when solar-panel prices fell as dozens of new Chinese polysilicon-makers started operating. The sudden glut in the raw material to make solar panels 
coincided with a drop in orders from European companies hit by the recession. The result: Polysilicon prices fell by half from January peaks. HSBC estimates they could drop 
20% more by the end of 2010. 

Softening prices created an opportunity for Chinese regulators. Officials are now talking about raising solar power capacity targets five- or tenfold, so that by 2020 China could 

have more than double current global solar-power capacity. 
Executives at Trina and Yingli say increased economies of scale from making more panels for China will push costs even lower. "We could go to $1 a watt by the end of 2010," 
which would be a landmark in bringing solar power in parity with conventionally produced electricity, says Yingli's Chief Executive, Miao Liansheng, a veteran of the People's 
Liberation Army who sold cosmetics before turning to solar panels. 

"The Chinese manufacturers can now make [solar panels] a lot cheaper than Europe, the United States and Japan because the whole supply chain is now available in China," 
says Martin Green, who runs the photovoltaic center at the University of South Wales in Australia, a training ground for many scientists working in China's solar industry. "The 
Chinese are making it more affordable, and they're more adventurous in introducing new technology as well." 

The ability to manufacture cheaply is attracting the notice of U.S. utilities. Huaneng says it can make gasification equipment cheaper than foreign rivals. 

Duke Energy Corp., of Charlotte, N.C., signed a pact with Huaneng in August to share information on clean-coal technology. Duke says it would take eight years to build an IGCC 
plant in the U.S. -- versus three in China.

Abstract 
When Mr. Obama journeys to the Danish capital Dec. 18, he will be hard-pressed to satisfy the desires of other nations for the U.S. to commit to deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, or for a long-term deal to subsidize developing nations' efforts to install low-carbon energy technology and to preserve forests. 

Full Text 
On the same day that President Barack Obama decided to commit 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he reached out to global leaders in a series of phone calls and a White House meeting. When he finished talking about his military decision, he pivoted to another issue: the world's climate. 
In a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a videoconference with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and phone calls to the leaders of France, Russia, China, Germany, India and Poland, Mr. Obama pointed to his administration's efforts to use regulatory power to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and made a pitch for action at the global summit in Copenhagen. After the calls, the White House declared that the president expected something meaningful could come from the summit. 
When Mr. Obama journeys to the Danish capital Dec. 18, he will be hard-pressed to satisfy the desires of other nations for the U.S. to commit to deep cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, or for a long-term deal to subsidize developing nations' efforts to install low-carbon energy technology and to preserve forests. Mr. Obama may offer precise numbers and pledges, but he doesn't have the votes for legislation to put them into effect. 
The president's immediate challenge is persuading 60 senators to support a proposal to require sharp cuts in U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, and institute a system that requires businesses to pay for the right to emit such gases. Most Republicans oppose the cap-and-trade bill, as do some members of Mr. Obama's own party. 
Sen. James Webb, a Virginia Democrat whose state depends on coal for 45% of its electricity, says legislation backed by Mr. Obama to require companies to pay for their greenhouse-gas emissions would lead to a "huge bureaucracy." Mr. Webb drove home his concerns about the Copenhagen summit in a public letter warning Mr. Obama not to commit the U.S. to a nationwide emission-reduction program. "As you well know from your time in the Senate, only specific legislation agreed upon in the Congress, or a treaty ratified by the Senate, could actually create such a commitment on behalf of our country," Mr. Webb wrote. 
Climate politics are both national and global. Mr. Obama faces challenges in both arenas. At the same time, he is juggling rivalries among other major nations in an effort to forge a climate deal that doesn't put the U.S. economy at risk. 
China will be the key to any world-wide climate deal. In private meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Nov. 17, Mr. Obama won some promises, especially on a key issue for the U.S.: China's willingness to allow verification of its claims to curbing greenhouse-gas emissions. A joint statement that day by the two presidents included language on the issue that Mr. Obama wanted. 
A little-noticed tete-a-tete with Premier Wen Jiabao the next day may have been more crucial, a senior administration official said. Mr. Wen wanted Mr. Obama to outline his proposed commitments to cutting emissions before China put forward a proposal. The U.S. president assured the Chinese premier that he would lay his cards on the table soon. 
On Nov. 24, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived in Washington for the first official state visit of the Obama presidency. Mr. Obama told Mr. Singh that China and the 
U.S. would put firm climate targets on the table. But if India stood on the sidelines, no progress would be made. 
Messrs. Obama and Singh signed a joint statement committing to cooperation on climate change. The next day, Mr. Obama announced specific emissions targets he would personally take to Copenhagen. The Chinese put their targets on the table the following day, and a week later, India followed suit. 
China and India aren't offering to cut emissions, as Mr. Obama has done. They are proposing to make their economies more energy-efficient -- which could mean their total emissions grow as their economies grow. That could further complicate the task of winning over skeptics in Congress.

Abstract 
Temperature will be at the mercy of the newly powerful economies. [...] an expensive effort to reduce Western emissions sets a worthless example. 

Full Text 
Imagine a "dream" agreement emerging from Copenhagen next week: The U.S. agrees to cut greenhouse emissions 80% by 2050, as President Barack Obama has been promising. The other developed countries promise to cut emissions by 60%. China promises to reduce its CO2 intensity by 70% in 2040. Emerging economies promise that in 2040, when their wealth per capita has grown to half that of the U.S., they will cut emissions by 80% over the following 40 years. And all parties make good on their pledges. 
Environmental success, right? Wrong. Even if the goals are all met, emissions will continue rising to nearly four times the current level. Total atmospheric CO2 will rise to near 700 parts per milion by 2080 (the current level is 385), and -- if the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models are right -- global temperature will rise about six degrees Fahrenheit at mid latitudes. 
The reason is that most future carbon emissions will not come from the currently industrialized world, but from the emerging economies, especially China. And China, which currently emits 30% more CO2 per year than the U.S., has not promised to cut actual emissions. It and other developing nations have promised only to cut their carbon "intensity," a technical term meaning emissions per unit of GDP. 
China claims it is already cutting CO2 intensity by 4% a year as part of its five-year plan. President Hu Jintao has hinted that at Copenhagen China will offer to continue such reductions. By 2040, that will add up to a 70% reduction in intensity. 
Sounds good, but here's the catch: With 10% annual growth in China's economy, a 4% cut in intensity is actually a 6% annual increase in emissions. India and other developing countries have similar CO2 growth. That 6% yearly increase is what is shown in the nearby chart. 
True, China's CO2 per capita is only a quarter of the U.S. emissions rate. But warming doesn't come from emissions per capita, it comes from total emissions. 
China's carbon intensity is now five times that of the U.S.; it is extremely carbon inefficient. By the time the Chinese cut emissions intensity by 45%, its yearly total will be over twice that of the U.S. And in the proposed Copenhagen dream scenario, by 2025 China's emissions will actually surpass those of the U.S. per capita. 
If the issue is rising emissions in the next several decades, the bottom line is simple: The developed world is rapidly becoming irrelevant. 
Every 10% cut in the U.S. is negated by one year of China's growth. By 2040 China could be the most economically dominant nation on earth. The West might be able to cajole it, but won't be able to impose sanctions on China. Temperature will be at the mercy of the newly powerful economies. 
Moreover, an expensive effort to reduce Western emissions sets a worthless example. Only emissions cuts that provide measurable economic benefit to the developing nations will be adopted by them. If the 80% U.S. emissions cut winds up hurting the U.S. economy, it guarantees China will never follow our example. 
Cheap green energy is not going to be easy. Coal is dirt cheap, and China has been installing a new gigawatt coal plant each week -- enough to supply five completely new cities the size of New York every year. 
Technological change can help a great deal. For now carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from coal combustion is unproven, but so is cheap solar. I expect we can make CCS work. Perhaps the West can subsidize CCS in China or pay to make its plants CCS ready. A dollar spent in China can reduce CO2 much more than a dollar spent in the U.S. 
There is another alternative: luck. Here's how it could help. Scientists are aware of a phenomenon that would counter the greenhouse effect: warmth evaporates water; water creates clouds; clouds reflect sunlight. A small cloud increase would significantly reduce predicted warming. The IPCC gives such cloud feedback only a 10% chance. My estimate is 30%. Clouds may already be kicking in, responsible for the negligible global warming of the past 12 years. Maybe, but we don't know. That's why we need luck. 
Perhaps we could geoengineer a solution: Squirt a few million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight, emulating the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. We'll certainly get pretty sunsets. Or we could foam up the oceans to increase reflectivity. Many people find such ideas scarier than warming because of the threat of unintended consequences. 
Another option is that we could learn to live with global warming. Despite claims to the contrary, storms aren't increasing. The rate of hurricanes hitting the U.S. coast has been constant for a century, and the number of damaging tornadoes has been going down. Will Happer, a former director of research for the Department of Energy, argues that additional CO2 may have helped the agricultural revolution. And chilly Berkeley might be nicer with a few degrees warming. 
But the bottom line is that 80% cuts in U.S. emissions will have only a tiny benefit. The bulk of our effort is best directed at helping the emerging economies conserve energy and move rapidly toward efficient solar, wind and nuclear power. Developing cheap carbon capture and sequestration is also a priority. Above all, we need to recognize that make-the-West-bear-the-burden Copenhagen proposals are meaningless.

Abstract 
Mr. Soros suggested that rich nations finance climate subsidies for developing nations by tapping into some of the $283 billion in special drawing rights that the IMF issued to respond to the global financial crisis earlier this year. 

Full Text 
COPENHAGEN -- Financier George Soros proposed that rich nations tap into special currency reserves issued by the International Monetary Fund to finance developing nations' efforts to combat climate change. 
Making the proposal, Mr. Soros waded into the key dispute between rich and poor nations at the United Nations climate summit here. 
Mr. Soros suggested that rich nations finance climate subsidies for developing nations by tapping into some of the $283 billion in special drawing rights that the IMF issued to respond to the global financial crisis earlier this year. More than $150 billion of those rights went to the 15 biggest developed economies, he said. Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are a form of composite currency issued by the IMF to its members. 
"Rich countries could double available funding to combat climate change by donating recently issued special drawing rights to a new green fund," Mr. Soros said. "This fund would jump-start investment in low-carbon energy sources, reforestation efforts, rainforest protection, land-use reform, and adaptation programs." 
Developing countries expressed support for the idea, while European Union negotiators responded with skepticism. The IMF declined to comment. 
Mr. Soros is among a cadre of business and political figures in Copenhagen hoping to sway the bargaining among 190 nations over what should be done to cut the emissions linked to a trend of rising temperatures, and who should pay the price. The conference is scheduled to end Dec. 18 with a gathering of world leaders. 
The U.N.'s chief climate negotiator said "some progress" is being made toward deals that leaders can consider next week. "There is real seriousness now to negotiate, good progress is being made in a number of areas, especially in the area of technology," said Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Countries agreed that a new executive body should be set up and would be responsible "for accelerating action on technology development and transfer." 
The transfer of technology to developing countries to help them limit their greenhouse-gas emissions is a delicate matter in the talks because of issues such as intellectual-property rights and patents. Technology transfer could be a profit opportunity for investors and companies with solar panels, wind turbines, carbon scrubbers and other technology. 
Mr. Soros said in October he would invest up to $1 billion in clean-energy technology, and announced the formation of a policy initiative to address global warming, which he would fund with $10 million a year over 10 years. 
Without action to put limits on consumption of fossil fuels, however, some clean-energy bets may not pay out, because fuels such as coal and oil are cheap, abundant, and don't require expensive new technology. 
Poor countries are calling on the U.S. and the European Union to subsidize investments in clean-energy technology. 
Developing countries, backed by some nongovernmental organizations, embraced Mr. Soros's idea. "As we are sitting now, the IMF is sitting with more than $200 billion of SDRs that are not being used," said Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, Sudan's ambassador to the U.N. and chairman of the Group of 77 developing nations, in a news conference Thursday. Issuing that money wouldn't create inflation, just "effective demand," he said. 
EU representatives were cautious. "We have to be very careful in the way we use the special drawing rights. It is an instrument that can be used in very specific situations," said Artur Runge-Metzger, a lead EU negotiator. "There is no way we can just print money in order to make sure there is sufficient finance on the table."

U.S. News: Big Utility Turns Bullish on Carbon Capture

Abstract 
Mike Morris, chief executive of Ohio-based AEP, said his company's early experience with a carbon capture and storage project at its Mountaineer power plant in West Virginia had exceeded expectations. 

Full Text 
The head of American Electric Power Co., the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the U.S., said advances in technology would allow the company to eliminate the emissions from its coal-fired power plants by 2025. 
Mike Morris, chief executive of Ohio-based AEP, said his company's early experience with a carbon capture and storage project at its Mountaineer power plant in West Virginia had exceeded expectations. As a result, he believes AEP will be able to retire 25% of its coal-burning power plants and install advanced carbon-capture equipment on the remaining 75%. 
That optimism represents a significant change for an influential executive who in the past has been skeptical about the industry's ability to capture and store carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas, in a cost-effective manner. 
"This still is an extremely expensive undertaking, but the answer is near at hand," said Mr. Morris in an interview Tuesday. 
Mr. Morris's comments came one day after the Environmental Protection Agency said it would move to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation and industrial sources. 
Mr. Morris says it now looks like it will be possible to cover all the costs of carbon capture and storage by roughly doubling the cost of electricity from plants like Mountaineer, to 8 cents a kilowatt hour from 4 cents, before subtracting for subsidies that may be available. He believes that still will be cheaper than electricity from the next generation of nuclear plants. As such, it could be more affordable to keep retrofitted coal-fired plants operating than to replace them. 
Technical problems could arise that would change forecasts, and many of Mr. Morris's calculations rest on the assumption that Congress will set emission limits and approve subsidies to help pay for the technology. Such climate-change legislation still faces hurdles, and the changes would mean higher electricity costs for consumers. 
If AEP, which generates power in 11 states from Ohio to Texas, can find a way to incur the added costs for carbon capture and remain competitive, that could blaze a trail for smaller utilities to do the same. 
The coal industry and the Obama administration insist that carbon capture and storage technology is an essential component of finding a way for the U.S. to significantly cut its greenhouse-gas emissions. The U.S. relies on coal for roughly half its electricity. Critics say the technology currently available is neither affordable nor reliable. 
AEP's Mountaineer project is one of the first attempts to put the technology to the test in the U.S. The utility is capturing less than 2% of the carbon dioxide produced by the 1,330-megawatt power plant. But, with the help of $335 million in Department of Energy funding, it plans to capture about 18% in the next few years. The gas is being injected nearly two miles underground "where it's staying put," Mr. Morris said. 
AEP has found it is able to run the carbon capture and storage equipment with only about half as much energy as it initially believed would be required, a significant cost savings. 
Mr. Morris said his firm would be an "aggressive" pursuer of federal incentives to capture and permanently store carbon dioxide. 
Legislation passed earlier this year by the House would allow AEP to collect payments as high as $90 a ton by sequestering carbon dioxide from its plants. But there is no certainty that the subsidies Mr. Morris is counting on will be approved. 
AEP is sharing $979 million in federal stimulus funds, awarded last week by the Department of Energy, with two other big carbon-capture projects. 
Southern Co. plans to use a different process to capture carbon dioxide at a plant in Alabama. It is receiving $295 million in federal money for the $650 million project. 
Summit Energy Co., the third successful applicant for Energy Department money, intends to build a plant that will convert coal into a flammable gas near Odessa, Texas. The 400-megawatt plant will get about a third of its revenue from power sales, a third from the sale of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery and a third from the sale of other gasses, such as urea, which is used to make fertilizer. The $2 billion project got $350 million in Energy Department funding and is expected to be operational by 2014.

Full Text 
Industry groups vowed to fight an Obama administration proposal to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, even as some companies prepared to comply with restrictions they regard as inevitable. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday declared emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, to be a danger to human health. That clears the way for the EPA to limit emissions, initially from power plants, refineries, cement plants and other big factories. 
Several utilities are planning to shut smaller coal-burning power plants that don't warrant upgrades. Progress Energy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. in recent weeks said they likely will retire nearly 30 smaller coal-fired plants in the next decade. 
Other executives say they don't know whether they would be affected by the EPA rules, because they haven't measured their carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Fletcher Steele, president of Pine Hall Brick Co., said he plans to measure how much carbon dioxide his company might release when it is running full tilt. The Winston-Salem, N.C., company uses natural gas and sawdust to fire kilns that bake bricks; it is running at about 40% of capacity because of the building-industry collapse. 
Mr. Steele said controls on carbon dioxide would be costly and technically complex. But he believes his business is somewhat insulated from such expenses because bricks are too heavy and low value to be globally traded. 
Mr. Steele noted that the EPA three years ago forced Pine Hall and other brick makers to study carbon-monoxide emissions. The company found it could significantly reduce those emissions with subtle adjustments in how gases are burned and other technical tweaks. 
"I don't know that we can do the same with CO2," he said. "It's a natural byproduct of combustion, so I just don't know how you get around it." 
Critics questioned the timing of the announcement, on the same day as the start of an international climate conference in Copenhagen. 
"It is hardly the time to risk the remainder of the U.S. industrial sector in an attempt to achieve a short-term international public-relations victory," said Charles T. Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association. 
"American consumers and businesses alike will be dramatically affected" if the agency forces refiners to make costly changes to their facilities, Mr. Drevna said in a statement. The refiners group contends the EPA has failed to consider science that contradicts its conclusions. 
Others questioned the impact of limiting greenhouse gases in one country, when airborne emissions easily cross borders and the threat of climate change is global. "We don't fly just within the 50 states," said Elizabeth Merida, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, a Washington-based industry group for U.S. airlines. 
Like other trade groups, ATA said its members had already cut emissions significantly, by increasing fuel efficiency of commercial airplanes by 110% between 1978 and 2008. ATA joined global airlines earlier this year in an industry plan that would raise fuel efficiency another 1.5% annually through 2020 and limit carbon-dioxide emissions after that date. 
Monday's action makes it more likely EPA will limit emissions from power plants -- which produce about 40% of U.S. industrial greenhouse gases -- and other facilities that emit more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases each a year. The EPA on Sept. 30 said it would require these plants to limit emissions of carbon dioxide in new or expanded facilities, by requiring them to install the best emission-control equipment, beginning as soon as next spring. 
Utility executives have said they prefer that Congress, rather than the EPA, regulate greenhouse emissions. That is because Congress has more freedom than the EPA to set up a system using incentives and, possibly, a trading mechanism, to gradually reduce emissions. By contrast, the EPA is limited to technology-based approaches, and admits there aren't currently affordable, reliable methods to capture and store carbon dioxide. 
"A carbon bill would give more clarity to what you need to do and when," said David Ratcliffe, chief executive of Southern Co., a big utility based in Atlanta, in a recent interview. 
An executive of DuPont Co. agreed. "Only Congress can enact the kind of comprehensive program needed to ensure we achieve emissions reductions in the most cost-effective manner," Michael Parr, the chemical maker's manager of government affairs, said in an e-mailed statement. The EPA, Mr. Parr said, can't regulate greenhouse-gas emissions "in a flexible and economically efficient way." 
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has said the administration also prefers that Congress act, but that EPA is required to move ahead if Congress doesn't. 
Emissions of energy-related carbon dioxide dropped 2.9% in 2008, after growing an average of 1% per year from 1990 to 2007, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration reported Friday. 
"The recession has given everyone a chance to stand still" and take stock, Southern Co.'s Mr. Ratcliffe said. 
Most small businesses wouldn't be affected by the rule. Rasma Zvaners, policy director of the American Bakers Association, said most of its members emit fewer than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. But she worries that bakers may be affected by higher natural-gas prices.

Abstract 
Made under the Clean Air Act, it also opens up large emitters such as power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and metal smelters to regulations that limit their output of carbon dioxide and other gases. According to the EPA, many states have a 100-ton-threshold level for operating permits and 250-ton level for construction permits. 

Full Text 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as expected, on Monday declared greenhouse gases a danger to public health, a decision that could soon lead to new emissions 

regulations for businesses across the economy. 
The "endangerment finding" announced by EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson is necessary to move ahead on new emissions standards for cars due out in March 2010. Made under 
the Clean Air Act, it also opens up large emitters such as power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and metal smelters to regulations that limit their output of carbon dioxide 
and other gases. 

"These long overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the U.S. government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the 

opportunity of clean-energy reform," Ms. Jackson said. 
The controversial decision, proposed by the administration earlier this year, comes as a global climate summit opens in Copenhagen. It gives the administration leverage in its 
negotiations and puts pressure on Congress to pass a bill that cuts greenhouse gases in a more economically efficient way. 

Though the House has passed such a bill, the Senate has faced a number of political hurdles. 

Environmentalists celebrated the announcement. "This is the most significant step the federal government has taken on global warming," said Emily Figdor, director for 
Environment America's federal global-warming program. "The stage is now set for [the] EPA to hold the biggest global-warming polluters accountable." 
Some lawmakers and groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers warned the decision could bring the entire economy to a 

halt, not only regulating large emitters within months, but also opening other mobile sources and smaller emitters to regulation. 

"With double-digit unemployment and over 3.5 million jobs already lost this year, the administration inexplicably continues to push for a job-killing national energy tax -- either 
through legislation or regulation," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said. 
However, Ms. Jackson maintains "there are ways to sensibly move forward on regulations," and she said the agency has insured that small and medium-sized businesses "will 

not be regulated." 
Without any cost analyses of new greenhouse-gas regulations, it is difficult to estimate what the actual impact could be on the economy. Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the 

utility industry group Edison Electric Institute, pointed to cost predictions for federal legislation as a guide to the cost. Estimates for legislation vary between $100 a year to 
$1,000 a year extra for families, and such legislation is specially designed to moderate costs. 
"The only certainty is that EPA regulation would be far more expensive than congressional-designed legislation," Mr. Riedinger contends. 
Although industry officials say no economic study of the impacts of greenhouse-gas regulations under the Clean Air Act has been published, the EPA strongly challenges dire 

economic assertions. 

Ms. Jackson indicated the agency would soon finalize a new "tailoring rule" that will set a greenhouse-gas-emissions threshold for regulators at 25,000 tons a year. This is 
designed to target the largest emitters in the country. 
The EPA says that would mean around 13,600 coal-burning power stations, crude refineries, metal smelters and other industrial facilities would come under existing regulations. 
Specifically, for any new construction or modification that would affect greenhouse-gas emissions, companies would be required to apply for permits that include the "best 

available technology." The EPA is seen finalizing what is considered the best available technology in 2011. 
Asked when the agency would draft new regulations for existing large emitting facilities, Ms. Jackson declined to give a timeline. 
Industry lawyers say if the EPA finalizes its auto-emissions rule by March 31, as expected, regulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide would automatically start 60 

days later. 
Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air administrator under the George W. Bush administration and now head of the Bracewell & Giuliani Environmental Strategies Group, said this is 
the first time the agency has ever made a standalone endangerment finding. He thinks it was a political decision. 

"It's clearly designed to set the stage for the Copenhagen conference," Mr. Holmstead said. 
Previously, the EPA had synchronized endangerment determinations with its rule-makings. 
But provisions in the EPA's tailoring rule may mean the 25,000-tons-a-year threshold won't apply in many states. 
Peter Glaser, a lawyer representing utilities at the firm Troutman Sanders LLP in Washington, said the EPA tailoring proposal explicitly says that federal law doesn't preempt state laws on the major pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. According to the EPA, many states have a 100-ton-threshold level for operating permits and 250-ton level for construction permits. If those levels apply, they would affect one million to four million facilities across the country, the EPA said. 
"This is certainly not an ending," Ms. Jackson said. "We will continue to work under the Clean Air Act."

Abstract 
Climate scientists failed to anticipate the absence of warming in the last decade, a point that Kevin Trenberth, head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, privately conceded in one of the disclosed emails was a "travesty." 

Full Text 
For months, the U.N. climate change summit that began yesterday in Copenhagen has been billed as the world's last best hope to match the scientific consensus on global warming with a policy consensus. But now it turns out there is little of either, and Copenhagen looks like it will go down as one of the more remarkable cases of political hubris in recent memory. 
That's no bad outcome, given the ambitions of Copenhagen's organizers to impose heavy new carbon taxes on top of a struggling world economy. The Australian Senate last week defeated Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's cap-and-trade legislation, largely due to its job-killing potential in the coal-producing continent. Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister, said Thursday "there is no question of India accepting a legally binding emission reduction cut." China has promised to cut the rate of growth in its carbon emissions, which would nevertheless double over the next decade even on the most optimistic scenario. 
As for the U.S., it has become clear even to liberals that it was not the Bush Administration alone that was standing in the way of a global climate deal. Last Thursday, nine Senators sent a letter outlining the terms of their support for cap-and-trade legislation, including that every other country enact and enforce carbon legislation of their own. And those were Democrats. 
President Obama has promised an 83% cut in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (from their 2005 level) by 2050. But such extravagant pledges are only possible when everyone knows they won't happen. Yesterday's announcement by the Environmental Protection Agency that it will regulate carbon as a dangerous pollutant is an attempt to run around Congress in order to impress Copenhagen's conferees, but it is also deeply undemocratic and betrays the lack of broader public support. 
So what exactly is the point of Copenhagen? The question needs to be asked all the more insistently in the wake of last month's disclosure of thousands of documents and emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU), long considered an authoritative center of temperature data, modeling and forecasts. 
At a minimum, the emails demonstrate the lengths some of the world's leading climate scientists were prepared to go to manufacture the "consensus" they used to demand drastic steps against global warming. The emails are replete with talk of blacklisting dissenting scientists and journals, manipulating peer review and avoiding freedom of information requests. 
Nor can the emails be dismissed as a handful of scientists showing their petulant streak. Scientific research must be subject to testing, verification and, if necessary, disproof. Otherwise, its conclusions are worthless. That's especially true if the basic data on which the climate records are based are deleted, as seems to have been the case with the CRU, or if the elaborate computer models used to forecast climate turn out to be poorly designed, as also seems to be the case. 
The core question raised by the emails is why their authors would behave this way if they are as privately convinced of the strength of their case as they claim in public. The Earth's climate is a profoundly complex system, sensitive, dynamic and subject to a dizzying range of variables interacting in ways that remain poorly understood. Carbon dioxide is only one of those variables. Climate scientists failed to anticipate the absence of warming in the last decade, a point that Kevin Trenberth, head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, privately conceded in one of the disclosed emails was a "travesty." 
Given this, the public is entitled to wonder how exactly climate scientists can state with such certainty that temperatures have never been higher, or that they are sure to rise in the coming decade, to say nothing of the rest of the century. The public is also entitled to know how the climatologists can suggest the precise degrees by which the Earth will warm, or why a warmer Earth is, on balance, worse than a colder one. Is there a "correct" global average temperature? 
The public also has a right to wonder whether the bulk of the scarce financial resources available to mitigate ecological risks ought to be devoted primarily to climate change rather than to other threats to the environment and public health. For several years, Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg has been convening meetings in Copenhagen of some of the world's leading economists to consider that very question. Overwhelmingly they have concluded that the world's dollars, euros and yen are better spent on tackling diseases such as AIDS or malaria or problems such as malnutrition and run-of-the-mill pollution than on hugely expensive (and dubiously effective) carbon-mitigation schemes. 
This conclusion is only common sense: Given the choice between spending $100 to feed a hungry child in the present or combat a notional climate problem that might or might not have real consequences a century hence, most of us would surely choose the former. We would do so, moreover, with the confidence that the technologies of the future will be better suited to deal with whatever climate problems might then exist. 
A typical retort is that "we can't afford to wait until it's too late," but one may as well ask whether the child in our example should go hungry while the developed world spends its money on global warming mitigation in the Third World. Yet that is exactly what the conferees at Copenhagen seem prepared to do, to the tune of billions of dollars per year. 
Even if the Earth does warm by a degree or two this century, the world will be better able to cope with any consequences the more prosperous it is. The worst policy would be to impose higher energy and other costs that reduce global growth for decades. The proponents of cap and trade point to this or that study claiming that a tax on the world's main current energy supplies (oil, natural gas, coal) is cost free. But this also defies common sense. The Chinese and Indians don't believe it, and neither do middle-class Americans who can't easily afford hundreds of dollars a year in extra electricity or transportation costs. 
Meanwhile, none of the "green" energy sources -- wind, solar or biofuels -- has so far proved even remotely efficient or scalable, while often entailing serious environmental consequences of their own. These industries exist mainly because governments have thrown tens of billions in subsidies at them, and still they can't compete with carbon sources. 
Much of the momentum for Copenhagen is now driven by the alternative fuels industry and its investors, who stand to lose vast sums unless governments artificially raise the price of carbon. These include our friends at Kleiner Perkins, the ecoventure capital fund that includes Al Gore as a partner. And of course that part of the political class congenitally eager to redistribute taxpayer monies also wants to dispense "carbon credits" to friends and political donors. 
By now, the idea that global warming represents the gravest threat to humanity has become totemic in much of the world, a belief invested with religious fervor and barely susceptible to rational discussion, let alone debate. Yet it remains telling how quickly a sense of reality has reasserted its cold grip in light of the choices Copenhagen now brings starkly into view. 
Mr. Obama has delayed his trip to the conference until its final day, when he thinks he might salvage some kind of deal. Perhaps he will. Then again, Copenhagen is more likely to prove that it takes more than environmental faith and political opportunism to forge a genuine global consensus.

Abstract 
The federal government recently handed out 17 grants totaling $40 million, as part of its stimulus package, to research equipment for drilling into the earth's hot rocks. Tapping geothermal energy requires drilling into the earth and using its natural pockets of water or steam to run generators that make electricity, much like coal is burned to make steam and produce power. 

Full text 
Baker Hughes Inc. has been developing technology to drill for crude oil ever since the discovery of the Spindletop gusher set off Texas's black-gold bonanza a century ago. 
Now the oil-services company wants to build a better drill to tap the earth's geothermal energy. 
The Houston-based company is trying to create drills and measurement equipment that can function at nearly 600 degrees Fahrenheit, if not more; a geothermal well in northern Japan in the mid 1990s topped 930 degrees. A typical oil well doesn't get much hotter than 400 degrees. 
At very high temperatures, typically dependable drills seize up. Sophisticated measurement equipment and state-of-the-art steering technology can get cooked. 
"Imagine taking your home stereo and throwing it in the oven," says Doug Patterson, a manager at Baker Hughes's Houston Technology Center. "The materials change form." 
Baker Hughes isn't alone in trying to develop new technology for the emerging geothermal market. The federal government recently handed out 17 grants totaling $40 million, as part of its stimulus package, to research equipment for drilling into the earth's hot rocks. 
Honeywell International Inc., General Electric Co. and Schlumberger Ltd., the world's largest oil-field services firm by revenue and a major Baker Hughes competitor, are working on instruments and electronics that work reliably at 600 degrees. Baker Hughes's rivals declined to discuss their projects. 
While Baker Hughes doesn't break out its spending on geothermal research, the company spent $263 million last year on developing new products out of a total research-and­development budget of $426 million. 
Developing the new drilling tools could prove lucrative. The geothermal industry still is small compared with oil or natural gas but is expected to grow quickly in coming years as demand for clean electricity soars. 
Tapping geothermal energy requires drilling into the earth and using its natural pockets of water or steam to run generators that make electricity, much like coal is burned to make steam and produce power. Unlike wind and solar power, geothermal can run around the clock. In the eyes of utilities, it is a dependable source of power, similar to nuclear, coal or natural gas. It doesn't emit carbon or contribute to climate change. 
In some places, geothermal resources are plentiful. By some estimates, half of Nevada's electrical power could come from geothermal plants. About 20% of the Philippines' electricity already does. Even if better drills are developed, geothermal isn't a panacea, however. Getting the steam to the surface is tricky and in many areas, transmission lines must be built to deliver electricity to cities. 
But governments and some companies want to expand the potential of geothermal power by making its use possible even in places without underground pockets of steam. "Enhanced" geothermal projects involve finding superhot, but dry, rocks and adding water, creating man-made geothermal reservoirs. 
Finding a drill that can function reliably in such hot conditions deep under the earth's crust has been a problem throughout the industry. And failing drill bits eat up time and waste money. 
Virgil Welch, vice president of drilling at Vulcan Power Co., a geothermal company based in Bend, Ore., says he has seen drill bits break down because of ball bearings that can't handle the heat. "When you are 8,000 feet deep, it takes 24 hours to pull and change a bit," he says. 
Baker Hughes had tested drills and technology in pottery kilns but then switched to even hotter ovens. It is using metal-to-metal, rather than polymer seals. This year it introduced the Vanguard rotary drill, priced about 15% higher than regular drills, which it began developing two years ago. The company recommends the Vanguard for wells where the temperature gets above 550 degrees. The company eliminated plastic components that can melt and cause equipment to break down. 
But the geothermal industry isn't just interested in reliability. It also wants the same kind of technology that has helped the oil industry lower its costs, and that's more complicated. For example, the oil industry uses drills with technology that allows them to be steered precisely, which allows wells to be placed accurately. That's important for geothermal, too, because any unintended deviations can cause a well to lose some of its ability to produce steam. 
Baker Hughes's steerable-bit technology now works up to about 400 degrees -- not enough for the 600-degree geothermal wells. "We found some materials that alone stand up to the heat fine, but you put them together and they have a chemical reaction," Mr. Patterson says. 
Bakers Hughes is testing a tool in the western U.S. that can measure temperature, pressure and location during drilling. The prototype can operate at close to 400 degrees, about 100 degrees above the current limit, and Baker Hughes hopes to make the device more heat resistant in the future. 
Baker Hughes thinks the new equipment will also be useful outside the geothermal industry. Some new oil and natural-gas exploration areas are quite hot. 
"We think the geothermal market is promising," says David "Nic" Nickels, head of global geothermal operations for Baker Hughes. "But if we can develop something that works 
in geothermal it would definitely benefit the high-temperature oil and gas markets also."

Abstract 
An "endangerment" finding by the Environmental Protection Agency could pave the way for the government to require businesses that emit carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases to make costly changes in machinery to reduce emissions -- even if Congress doesn't pass pending climate-change legislation. 

Full text 
Officials gather in Copenhagen this week for an international climate summit, but business leaders are focusing even more on Washington, where the Obama administration is expected as early as Monday to formally declare carbon dioxide a dangerous pollutant. 
An "endangerment" finding by the Environmental Protection Agency could pave the way for the government to require businesses that emit carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases to make costly changes in machinery to reduce emissions -- even if Congress doesn't pass pending climate-change legislation. EPA action to regulate emissions could affect the U.S. economy more directly, and more quickly, than any global deal inked in the Danish capital, where no binding agreement is expected. 
Many business groups are opposed to EPA efforts to curb a gas as ubiquitous as carbon dioxide. 
An EPA endangerment finding "could result in a top-down command-and-control regime that will choke off growth by adding new mandates to virtually every major construction and renovation project," U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said in a statement. "The devil will be in the details, and we look forward to working with the government to ensure we don't stifle our economic recovery," he said, noting that the group supports federal legislation. 
EPA action won't do much to combat climate change, and "is certain to come at a huge cost to the economy," said the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group that stands as a proxy for U.S. industry. 
Dan Riedinger, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a power-industry trade group, said the EPA would be less likely than Congress to come up with an "economywide approach" to regulating emissions. The power industry prefers such an approach because it would spread the burden of emission cuts to other industries as well. 
Electricity generation, transportation and industry represent the three largest sources of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 
An EPA spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday on when the agency might finalize its proposed endangerment finding. Congressional Republicans have called on the EPA to withdraw it, saying recently disclosed emails written by scientists at the Climatic Research Unit of the U.K.'s University of East Anglia and their peers call into question the scientific rationale for regulation. 
The spokeswoman said that the EPA is confident the basis for its decision will be "very strong," and that when it is published, "we invite the public to review the extensive scientific analysis informing" the decision. 
EPA action would give President Barack Obama something to show leaders from other nations when he attends the Copenhagen conference on Dec. 18 and tries to persuade them that the U.S. is serious about cutting its contribution to global greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The vast majority of increased greenhouse-gas emissions is expected to come from developing countries such as China and India, not from rich countries like the U.S. But developing countries have made it clear that their willingness to reduce growth in emissions will depend on what rich countries do first. That puts a geopolitical spotlight on the 
U.S. 
At the heart of the fight over whether U.S. emission constraints should come from the EPA or Congress is a high-stakes issue: which industries will have to foot the bill for a climate cleanup. A similar theme will play out in Copenhagen as rich countries wrangle over how much they should have to pay to help the developing world shift to cleaner technologies. 
"There is no agreement without money," says Rosario Bento Pais, a top climate negotiator for the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm. "That is clear." 
An endangerment finding would allow the EPA to use the federal Clean Air Act to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions, which are produced whenever fossil fuel is burned. Under that law, the EPA could require emitters of as little as 250 tons of carbon dioxide per year to install new technology to curb their emissions starting as soon as 2012. 
The EPA has said it will only require permits from big emitters -- facilities that put out 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. But that effort to tailor the regulations to avoid slamming small businesses with new costs is expected to be challenged in court. 
Legislators are aware that polls show the public appetite for action that would raise energy prices to protect the environment has fallen precipitously amid the recession. 
Congressional legislation also faces plenty of U.S. industry opposition. Under the legislation, which has been passed by the House but is now stuck in the Senate, the federal government would set a cap on the amount of greenhouse gas the economy could emit every year. The government would distribute a set number of emission permits to various industries. Companies that wanted to be able to emit more than their quota could buy extra permits from those that had figured out how to emit less. 
Proponents of the cap-and-trade approach say emission-permit trading will encourage industries to find the least-expensive ways to curb greenhouse-gas output. But opponents say it will saddle key industries with high costs not borne by rivals in China or India, and potentially cost the U.S. jobs. 
The oil industry has warned that climate legislation could force some U.S. refineries to shut down, because importing gasoline from countries without emission caps could be cheaper than making the gasoline on domestic soil. 
Legislators "have decided that coal and electric users don't bear the burden" of emissions constraints for many years, said John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group. "Early in the program, oil users are the ones who are hammered." 
The Iron and Steel Institute, which represents more than 75% of steel made in the U.S., said that successful climate policy -- whether through the EPA or Congress -- must "reduce emissions without altering the competitiveness of American steelmakers." 
The issue of how curbing emissions would affect jobs in developed countries is likely to erupt in Copenhagen in the battle over how much rich countries should pony up for cleaner technologies in developing nations. 
Estimates of the cost for reducing emissions in developing countries vary widely, but the European Commission said in September that the bill could reach $150 billion annually by 2020. Leaders of the EU's 27 nations have said only that the EU would pay its "fair share" of the total, without committing to an amount. 
Yet EU industry lobbies are weighing in against that proposal. It is "not realistic," said Axel Eggert, spokesman for Eurofer, the trade group for European steelmakers. Steelmakers want to "make sure that the financing is not a subsidy for our competitors," he said.

Full Text 
Everybody talks about the environment these days, and a lot of people are even trying to do something about it. But amid all the discussion, it can be hard to keep the facts straight. Do you know how much electricity is wasted in the U.S. every year by appliances and electric gadgets in standby mode? Or what the most prevalent greenhouse gas is? And who started all this talk about the effect of greenhouse gases on climate, anyway? Try our quiz to see how familiar you are with your environment. 
1. The debate over how to power the U.S. has been raging since the Nixon years, and was given extra impetus during last year's presidential campaign. Just how does the U.S. keep the lights on? Match the share of electricity generated this year to the fuel source: 
A. Coal 1. 3.4% B. Nuclear power 2. 22% C. Natural gas 3. 45% D. Hydroelectric 4. 21% E. Other renewables 5. 7.4% 
ANSWER: A-3, B-4, C-2, D-5, E-1. Coal is still king, but it's the one source of power whose share of the electricity mix has fallen this year, to 45% from 49% last year. 

2. Speaking of power sources, what country gets the largest share of its electricity from renewable sources? 

A. Denmark 

B. Norway 

C. New Zealand 

D. Austria 

E. Iceland 

ANSWER: E. Iceland's power is about 75% hydroelectric and 25% geothermal. Geothermal power, or tapping the earth's underground heat, provides a rare double whammy for clean energy: It's cheap and always available. Just not everywhere. Norway, a close second in renewable sourcing, gets 99% of its electricity from hydroelectric power. 
3. Lots of countries rely on large hydroelectric projects, but in richer countries hydro has just about reached the limits of its capacity for one reason or another, shifting the focus to other possible power sources. What country gets the most juice from renewable energy other than hydro? 
A. Denmark 
B. Portugal 
C. Spain 
D. New Zealand 
E. Iceland 
ANSWER: A. Denmark gets 30% of its power from nonhydro renewable sources, mainly wind and biomass -- more than Iceland gets from geothermal power, or Portugal and Spain get from their extensive wind farms. 
4. Household appliances and electric gadgets suck up lots of energy in standby mode just to keep the clock on and the machine ready to go at a moment's notice. In rough terms, the amount of electricity wasted that way in the U.S. each year is equivalent to the output of: 
A. 0.8 nuclear power plants 
B. 1.8 nuclear power plants 
C. 8 nuclear power plants 
D. 18 nuclear power plants ANSWER: D. Scientists at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimate as much as 10% of U.S. residential electricity use is lost in "standby power." That's about one-sixth of all the power produced by the 104-strong fleet of nuclear reactors in the U.S. 
5. Worries about how to curb man-made greenhouse-gas emissions are now a driving force behind economic and foreign policy world-wide, as the current Copenhagen climate-change summit demonstrates, but how did it all get started? Who first described a link between man-made emissions, a greenhouse effect and rising global temperatures? 
A. Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) 
B. John Tyndall (1820-1893) 
C. Lord Kelvin (1824-1907) 
D. Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) 
E. Al Gore (1948- ) 
ANSWER: D. Fourier first proposed the idea of a "greenhouse effect." Tyndall first proved it was real, and the prestigious Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the U.K. is named after him. But Arrhenius was the first to link industrial activity, especially burning coal, to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- and to rising temperatures, though he initially expected that effect would take a few thousand years. 
6. When it comes to emissions of greenhouse gases, most people know the biggest culprits: China and the U.S. Which three countries round out the top five? 
A. Brazil 
B. Mexico 
C. South Korea 
D. India 
E. South Africa 
F. Russia 
G. Indonesia 
H. Japan 
ANSWER: G, A and D. Indonesia and Brazil have zoomed up the rankings due to the inclusion of tropical deforestation -- not just industrial activity -- in the tally. That's one reason people from investment bankers to think-tank types are becoming tree huggers: Preventing deforestation is seen as a relatively easy and cheap way to tackle a huge chunk of global emissions, though questions loom on enforcing forest-protection plans in remote places. 
7. Speaking of emissions, what's the most prevalent greenhouse gas in the earth's atmosphere? 
A. Methane 
B. Carbon dioxide 
C. Water vapor 
D. Tropospheric ozone 
E. Hot air from politicians 
ANSWER: C. Water vapor makes up by far the largest share of the gases in the atmosphere that interact with sunlight and contribute to global warming. However, water vapor also condenses into clouds, which help reflect sunlight, so most of the focus in limiting climate change is on longer-lived greenhouse gases that more effectively trap heat, such as carbon dioxide and methane. 
8. Overfishing is one of the big environmental problems affecting nearly every country. What is by far the most caught fish in the world by commercial fishermen? 
A. Cod 
B. Tuna 
C. Anchoveta 
D. Halibut 
E. Alaskan pollack 
ANSWER: C. Anchoveta, a relative of the anchovy that thrives all along the Pacific coast of South America, is used primarily for animal feed. The No. 2 catch, Alaskan pollack, makes up the vast majority of fish sticks and fast-food fish. 
9. Bottle recycling has never been more popular in the U.S. On average, how many pounds of plastic bottles did each American recycle last year? 
A. 1.6 pounds 
B. 8 pounds 
C. 16 pounds 
D. 24 pounds ANSWER: B. Some 2.4 billion pounds of plastic bottles were recycled in the U.S. in 2008, according to a joint report by the American Chemistry Council and the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers. That's a record, as is the percentage of bottles being recycled in the U.S. About 27% of all the milk jugs and soda bottles on store shelves eventually end up being recycled; those containers account for 99% of all plastic-bottle recycling. 
10. Water, water everywhere, but not so much to drink. About 70% of the Earth is covered by water, and there's more beneath the surface. But seawater is too salty to drink, and water at the poles and in glaciers is frozen. What percentage of the world's water is fresh and liquid? And what percentage is also found above ground, in lakes and rivers? 
A. 10% and 2% 
B. 5% and 1% 
C. 3% and 0.5% 
D. 1% and 0.3% 
ANSWER: D. Only 1% of the world's water is fresh and unfrozen -- and most of that is found in underground aquifers. Only 0.3% of the world's water is fresh surface water, including huge concentrations like the Great Lakes, the Amazon and Lake Baikal. That's one reason scientists, environmentalists, ecologists and military planners all worry that water shortages could become a source of conflict in coming decades.

Abstract 
Estimates of the climate sensitivity from recent observations, climate models, changes in the last millennium and periods further back in time, such as the last ice age, all support the assessment that a sustained doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is likely to lead to a warming between 2 and 4.5 degrees Celsius (approximately 4 to 8 degrees Farenheit); associated risks include sea level rise and rainfall changes.

Regarding: Richard S. Lindzen's "The Climate Science Isn't Settled," (op-ed, Dec. 1): While many important research questions remain in climate science, our fundamental understanding of the dominant cause of global warming over the past half-century is not one of them. 
Contrary to Mr. Lindzen's suggestions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment that "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] concentrations" is firmly based on multiple and strong lines of scientific evidence, including direct records of temperature change at the Earth's surface, in the atmosphere and of the ocean. Studies of the last millennium also demonstrate that external forcings contributed to past climate variability, but that warming into the 20th century cannot be attributed to a recovery from the Little Ice Age. The pattern and time evolution of warming can in fact only be explained if greenhouse gas forcing is included. In contrast with the suggestions made in the piece, the global temperature evolution of the past decade is consistent with the effects of natural variability superimposed on an evolving greenhouse gas signal. Studies attributing causes to observed changes account for climate variability fully and robustly. 
Mr. Lindzen also greatly misrepresents what we know about the climate system's sensitivity to greenhouse gas increases. Estimates of the climate sensitivity from recent observations, climate models, changes in the last millennium and periods further back in time, such as the last ice age, all support the assessment that a sustained doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is likely to lead to a warming between 2 and 4.5 degrees Celsius (approximately 4 to 8 degrees Farenheit); associated risks include sea level rise and rainfall changes. 
A great deal remains to be learned, but evidence demonstrates that greenhouse gas emissions have already caused substantial warming, and that they will continue to do so in the future.

Ms. Hergl and Mr. Zweirs are two of the authors of the attributions section of the 2007 IPCC report. 
Over the past 20 years I've noticed that I mow the grass a little later into the fall season than I did long ago. I also know when I visit the beach, the high-rise hotels are not yet under water. My skepticism regarding the "climate changers" does not mean I want to breathe polluted air. The problem is that, with abundant natural gas, the technology to gasify coal, develop nuclear energy, etc., we can have both a cleaner environment and efficient, clean abundant energy which will help drive economic growth and prosperity.

To have skeptics dismissed as Neanderthals is to discourage their participation in the peer review process, which, absent skeptics, is a sham. There can be no more unscientific statement than to say, "The science is settled." In science, nothing is ever over. This fact is the very engine of scientific progress. It is Einstein is revered for having stood Newtonian physics on its head, the reason why Einstein's model will someday, in turn, be stood on its head. 
The truth is that climate-change skeptics have been the true scientists all along and global-warming zealots have been reminders of an unenlightened era -- they are the real Neanderthals. 
Donald G. Gumprecht

If a respected MIT scientist like Mr. Lindzen argues that "the science isn't settled," and other scientists disagree, then doesn't the very dispute itself prove that the science isn't settled? 
Paul Hsieh 
Sedalia, Colo. 
Mr. Lindzen's reference to climate models reminds me of the many other articles printed on these pages in recent months regarding models of a different kind: economic ones. Many economists relied on models that failed to predict the recent crises. 
Certainly, structural changes and pattern shifts affecting our climate are less understood than those in our economy. However, climate models, with clear mathematical limitations, are the foundation of policy recommendations that will fundamentally change the way we live and govern. Climate scientists should realize the inherent limitation of models and include a bit of common sense in their analysis.

Abstract 
Poland also wants to be able to continue selling certain carbon credits after the Kyoto protocol expires in 2012. Because Poland has reduced CO2 emissions by 30% over the past 20 years, it can sell credits worth billions of euros. 

Full Text 
This week, officials from 192 countries will meet in Copenhagen to tackle global climate change, seeking a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Even if they can't negotiate a binding agreement, many countries hope at least to work out commitments to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions and provide assistance to poorer countries likely to be hardest hit by the effects of global warming. 
Each country, of course, has its own particular priorites and concerns, which is why an agreement is so difficult to reach. Here's a look at some of their agendas for Copenhagen. 
U.S. 
The U.S.'s failure to pass climate-change legislation has meant a delay in a deal at Copenhagen. But pending bills in Congress and the Obama administration's authority to regulate emissions give the country credibility -- and negotiating leverage toward an eventual agreement. The U.S. may still pledge to cut emissions about 17% by 2020, while offering funding of low-carbon initiatives for poorer countries to draw them to an agreement. The U.S. also wants other countries, mainly China and India, to commit on when their greenhouse-gas emissions will peak, and will demand stringent standards for reporting, monitoring and verification of emissions and reductions. 
China 
China has pledged to curb carbon emissions as a percentage of gross domestic product by 40% to 45% by 2020. These would be voluntary cuts and therefore unlikely to be part of a binding climate-change pact. But it signals China's interest in an agreement at Copenhagen. Such a deal could bring the country benefits: more funding and technology transfers from developed nations, and as an exporter of solar-power and wind-power equipment, increased demand for its products. What China dreads most is the end of Kyoto provisions that grant tradable credits for reducing emissions; China has been the top receiver for the credits, getting 59% of the total. 
India 
India, which has long resisted the imposition of carbon-emission caps, says it is ready to cut emissions intensity 20% to 25% by 2020, but won't accept legally binding targets. It argues that it needs development and economic growth before it should consider fixed emission caps and that the developed world has a historic responsibility to take more restrictive measures because it caused decades of atmospheric damage. India also favors financing and technology transfer to boost green energy solutions. 
Russia 
Climate change isn't high on Russia's agenda; its attention is on the massive investments it needs to make its aging Soviet-era industrial infrastructure more energy-efficient -­with a goal of a 40% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. Diplomats say the country is willing to reduce emissions between 20% and 25% from 1990 levels. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says Russia will join a post-Kyoto agreement only if other countries sign up for it and if Russian forests' contribution to reducing global carbon dioxide is taken into account. 
Brazil 
Brazil's government will aim to cut greenhouse-gas emissions between 36% and 39% by reducing deforestation in the Amazon rain forest and increasing the use of fuel-efficient cars and trucks that use biofuels as well as gasoline. But the emissions target is voluntary and depends on the government obtaining financing for the aggressive goals, indicating that Brazil isn't willing to stifle industrial output in Latin America's largest economy. And efforts to reduce deforestation in the Amazon could be stymied by lawlessness in the poverty-stricken region. 
European Union 
The 27-member European Union aims to speak with one voice in Copenhagen. Its goal: taking action that would limit global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The EU intends to cut CO2 emissions 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels and is willing to raise that target to 30% if other countries commit to do their part. It is also ready to help developing countries financially, but it hasn't committed to specific figures. Some Western European countries advocate generosity, but some newer members from Eastern Europe are much less willing to pay. 
Poland 
Poland and other Eastern European nations want a deal that isn't too economically burdensome. The issue is how financial support for developing countries should be shared by EU members. Wealthy members propose making contributions proportional to a country's emissions. But because Eastern members' energy sectors rely heavily on coal, they would pay disproportionately more than if shares were based on their economic output. Poland also wants to be able to continue selling certain carbon credits after the Kyoto protocol expires in 2012. Because Poland has reduced CO2 emissions by 30% over the past 20 years, it can sell credits worth billions of euros. 
Africa 
African countries blame developed countries for greenhouse-gas emissions and want to be compensated for the impact of global warming. But they disagree on priorities. The African Union wants billions of dollars (leaders won't say exactly how much) to adapt to climate change, which is blamed for record droughts in East Africa and flooding in other regions. Oil-producing nations, such as Nigeria, want compensation for the lost revenues that could result from expected declines in oil consumption by industrialized nations. 
Indonesia 
In Indonesia, the world's No. 3 carbon-dioxide emitter (after China and the U.S.), much of the emissions result from deforestation. It probably will ask for international technology and funds for forest conservation. Also, it favors self-monitoring in future programs that give credits for reducing emissions from deforestation, and hints it will oppose efforts to create an international monitoring body. The nation pledges to cut emissions 26% by 2020 from "business-as-usual" levels, but officials say Indonesia will raise its target to 41% if it receives the international funding and technology support it needs. 
Ecuador 
Ecuador, an oil producer, will come to Copenhagen with a novel idea: get rich countries to pay $3.5 billion to keep 850 million barrels of its crude in the ground. The oil is located in a natural reserve of the Amazonian forest whose protection will be a cornerstone of the talks. A delegation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Ecuador gets the group's presidency next year) has visited to look at the project. The government, which has renamed its oil ministry the "ministry of non-renewable resources," has pitched the idea to some European governments.

MUMBAI -- India is ready to cut emissions intensity 20%-25% by 2020, but won't accept legally binding targets, raising chances next week's global summit on climate change 
won't yield definitive results. 
India also won't accept an agreement that stipulates the setting of a "peaking year" for emissions, Forests and Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said while outlining India's 
strategy ahead of the United Nations climate-change conference in Copenhagen. 

A peaking year implies the setting of a date beyond which a nation must begin reducing emissions. 
"There is no question of compromising on these two nonnegotiables," the minister told lawmakers, adding these issues were "complete dark, red lines." 
Mr. Ramesh's statements come on the heels of pledges made by China and the U.S. last month to reduce emissions. China and the U.S. are the world's largest emitters of 

greenhouse gases; India is fourth. 

India opposes binding carbon-emissions cuts at the cost of slowing economic growth. Mr. Ramesh said the emissions-reduction targets were voluntary and unilateral, and don't 
depend on the outcome of the summit. 
"India, of all the 192 countries in the world, owes a responsibility not to the world but to itself to take climate change seriously," he said. 
The minister outlined a series of measures by which India proposes to meet its target on reducing emissions intensity, or the amount of carbon-dioxide emissions per unit of 

gross domestic product. 

Mr. Ramesh said proposals will be made to legislate mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for all vehicles by December 2011, and mandatory green building codes will be 
recommended to states and municipal administrations. 
India will also make amendments to the Energy Conservation Act to enable emissions-intensity reductions and report regularly on the state of the country's forests, he said. 
"We will ensure 50% of all new [power-plant] capacity will be based on clean-coal technology that will substantially reduce CO2 emissions from our power plants," Mr. Ramesh 

said. 
"This target puts pressure squarely back on industrialized country leaders," said Martin Kaiser, climate-policy director at Greenpeace International. 
More than 100 nations are set to gather in Copenhagen from Dec. 7-18 to attempt to draft a new accord to tackle global warming beyond 2012. The participation of countries 

such as India, China and the U.S. is seen as being vital to any successful talks, but leaders of several nations have conceded negotiations proceeded too slowly to produce a legally binding accord in Copenhagen. Credit: By Eric Yep

Abstract 
[...] the U.S. must reduce the share of fossil fuels -- currently 85% -- in the energy supply system, which includes everything from electricity generation and transportation to industrial uses. First start with the key measure of energy efficiency: energy use per unit of economic output. 

Full Text 
When President Obama goes to the Copenhagen climate change summit next week, he is expected to once again declare that the U.S. will reduce its carbon emissions 83% by 2050. Even though no legally binding agreement is expected, what Mr. Obama says in Denmark will define the U.S. position in subsequent international negotiations. He will not say how the cuts will be accomplished. For Americans, the details are worth knowing. 
Annual U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions currently average about 5.5 tons per person. Achieving Mr. Obama's goal would mean reducing this to 0.63 tons per person by midcentury, taking expected population growth of just under 1% per year into account. If the rest of the world were to do likewise, global carbon dioxide emissions would be 25% lower than today. 
Many climate scientists think this would put the world on track to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Of course, other countries may well have a different view of global equity. This includes China, which in the president's version would have to reduce its rapidly increasing per capita emissions to half the current level by 2050. 
Most anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from fossil fuels, so there are two main routes to achieving the president's goal. First, the U.S. must reduce the share of fossil fuels -­currently 85% -- in the energy supply system, which includes everything from electricity generation and transportation to industrial uses. And second, Americans must use energy more efficiently. 
The more we do of one, the less we'll need of the other. But ultimately what's required will depend on America's future economic growth. 
Uncompromising environmental advocates argue that the dangers of climate change are so great that carbon emissions must be eliminated regardless of economic impact. Politicians, who must answer to voters, are unlikely to agree. A look at the underlying numbers helps explain. 
Assume for now an annual economic growth target of 2% per capita for the next four decades. This would be higher than the disappointing 1.4% of the past decade, but roughly what the U.S. economy has achieved overall since 1970. With this target, the implications of the president's emission reduction goal become clearer. 
First start with the key measure of energy efficiency: energy use per unit of economic output. Recently this has been falling by about 2% each year. Suppose that, through more aggressive policies like rewriting building codes to ensure greater energy efficiency, it was accelerated to 3%. In effect, this would mean bringing the rate of progress in every state in the country up to the level of the best state performer. It is not at all clear how this would be possible, but even if it is, meeting the 83% goal would still require extraordinary decarbonization measures on the supply side. 
Here is a recipe that would work: Add 30,000 megawatts of new wind turbines every year between now and 2050 (this is nearly four times what was added in 2008, a record year). Add another 35,000 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity annually (more than 100 times what was added last year -- a record year for solar, too). 
That's just the beginning. Now multiply the nuclear reactor fleet fivefold by midcentury. Retrofit all existing coal-fired power plants with carbon capture and storage technology. And build twice as many new plants, also with carbon capture. Natural gas could substitute for coal, but only with carbon capture too. By 2050, the electric power system would be four times bigger than today. Two-thirds of the car and truck fleet would be powered by electricity, and the rest would run on advanced biofuels. 
All of this would indeed reduce carbon emissions by 83%. It would also practically eliminate America's dependence on oil imports. But could it be done? 
Perhaps, though not without enormous effort. Operating a power grid reliably and economically with intermittent solar and wind resources generating 40% of the electricity cannot be done today. Carbon capture and storage has yet to be demonstrated on a large scale. Meanwhile, a still vocal group of environmentalists remains adamantly opposed to nuclear energy -- even though it is the only low-carbon energy source that is both scaleable and already generating large amounts of electricity. 
Yet falling short on any of these decarbonization measures would require even more of the others, or even greater energy efficiency gains. Failing that, the only way to reach the 83% reduction goal would be through slower or even negative economic growth, i.e., lower living standards. This is a matter of arithmetic; it cannot be wished away. 
The president's expected announcement at Copenhagen is probably the minimum needed to keep international climate negotiations alive. But the implications for U.S. energy are radical in scale and scope. The American public, sensing that the new climate policy will bring higher energy costs and a massive new government presence in energy production, remains unconvinced, to judge by recent poll numbers. 
A steady stream of cost-reducing innovations in many different fields of energy technology -- if sustained over decades -- could bring the nation's climate and energy security goals within reach. But there are profound doubts about the government's ability to engineer this. When Mr. Obama returns from Europe, he will face an even tougher audience at home. Unless he can begin to dispel its doubts, his declaration of intent in Copenhagen will ring increasingly hollow.

Abstract 
Domestic producers have seen their Chinese market share hit nearly 60%, largely at the expense of foreign players such as Vestas Wind Systems, Gamesa and General Electric, which were dominant there just five years ago. 

Full Text 
[Financial Analysis and Commentary] 
Beijing has big plans for wind power as a renewable energy, but China may already have too much of a good thing. 
At home, China's power-transmission infrastructure can't handle the intermittent electricity supply already being generated from wind. It is estimated 30% of last year's wind-

power supply went unused. 

Yet Beijing wants more, hoping for 100 gigawatts of wind-power capacity to be built by 2020, making wind China's third-most-important power source behind coal and 
hydroelectric. By next year, the wind-power equipment being made will be twice what the nation can install, according to the central government. 
Foreign rivals are raising concerns Chinese producers will export excess capacity at cheap prices. The European Chamber of Commerce last week cited wind power as likely to 

stir trade tensions. 

Chinese companies have already proven formidable competitors. Domestic producers have seen their Chinese market share hit nearly 60%, largely at the expense of foreign 
players such as Vestas Wind Systems, Gamesa and General Electric, which were dominant there just five years ago. 
Critics suggest an implicit "Buy China" policy has helped domestic players, but they have competed strongly on price. Data from analysts IHS CERA show Chinese equipment 

suppliers sell turbines for about two-thirds the price of foreign competitors. 

The number of competitors has mushroomed, drawn by talk of greater reliance on renewable energy. Four companies accounted for more than 90% of the wind-turbine market 
in 2004. Now, 12 leaders account for about the same proportion, IHS CERA says. 
As local players duke it out, consolidation is likely, benefitting domestic leaders: Sinovel Wind, Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology and Dongfang Electric. 
Meanwhile, there is uncertainty as governments debate climate-change initiatives. The world may want China to commit to a greener future, but it is rapidly finding out that the 

push can come with some unwanted side effects.

China, U.S. Square Off On Climate Proposals

Abstract 
Left unanswered were a host of questions, most notably how both nations will achieve their cuts at a time when industries across the world are reeling from the recession and in no mood to sacrifice further economic growth in the name of the environment. 

Full text 
The world's top two greenhouse-gas-producing countries for the first time offered specific targets for controlling their emissions, but their broad promises ahead of a United Nations climate summit merely set the terms for a high-stakes struggle over money and future economic growth. 
China kicked off the latest round of global climate poker Thursday when it announced the country would aim to cut its "carbon intensity" -- or the amount of greenhouse gas it emits per unit of gross domestic product -- by 40% to 45% below 2005 levels by 2020. The plan is fundamentally different from those offered by the U.S. and the European Union in that it doesn't pledge to reduce emissions, but rather to slow the rate at which emissions grow. 
The move came a day after President Barack Obama announced he would travel to the U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen on Dec. 9 to deliver a pledge that the U.S. will cut greenhouse-gas emissions 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% by 2050. 
Left unanswered were a host of questions, most notably how both nations will achieve their cuts at a time when industries across the world are reeling from the recession and in no mood to sacrifice further economic growth in the name of the environment. 
The proposals by the U.S. and China -- which together account for 40% of the world's total emissions -- don't address one of the most contentious issues in the climate-change debate: Which countries and industries in the West will pay, and how much they'll pay, to help finance a clean-energy revolution in the developing world, home to many of their toughest competitors. 
China and other developing countries say they want the U.S. and other industrialized nations to pay 1% of their yearly gross domestic products to help the developing world finance emissions reductions. 
China notes that the U.S. and Europe developed in an era without constraints on greenhouse-gas emissions, which are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas are burned. Per capita incomes in China are less than a tenth of those in the U.S., despite the dramatic surge in wealth in the country's coastal cities. 
If the rest of the world wants China to shift its economy toward a cleaner path, China says, the rest of the world is going to have to help China pay for that transformation. India and other developing countries make a similar argument. 
U.S. officials have said they expect to offer some financial assistance to developing countries, but have not specified how much. U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has said the request for 1% of GDP, which would translate to more than $140 billion for the U.S. alone, is "untethered from reality." 
Many U.S. lawmakers and leaders of major U.S. industries are concerned that if the U.S. agrees to hard caps on emissions, and China agrees to become more energy efficient without a cap on growth, U.S. industries will be saddled with higher costs and become less competitive. 
The National Association of Manufacturers said Thursday in a statement that it wants additional details on the Obama administration's pledge: "As we evaluate this proposal, we will do so with an eye toward its impact on American jobs, our economic recovery and long-term growth." 
Beneath the green rhetoric, the actual promises from the U.S. and China don't appear to go far beyond near-term environmental improvements that the two economies already are on track to achieve, several analysts said. The recession has crimped industrial activity, and both countries have been improving their energy efficiency, because that cuts energy costs. 
Enthusiasm for tough climate action has also waned in the U.S. as the economy has soured. The U.S. House passed a climate bill with limits similar to those Mr. Obama will propose in Copenhagen. But the Senate has put off action until spring. 
The White House said Thursday that it welcomes "China's intention to cut the growth of their emissions," adding that the "international community will be closely analyzing this proposal." 
Neither the Chinese nor the U.S. proposals may satisfy the EU, which has been well ahead of the U.S. in pledging cuts. The bloc's 27 nations have agreed to lower greenhouse-gas emissions 20% below their 1990 levels by 2020, or the equivalent of a 14% cut from 2005 levels. They have also agreed to a larger reduction, equivalent to a 24% cut from 2005 levels by 2020, if other nations outside the bloc make substantial cuts. 
Some European leaders suggested that both the U.S. and Chinese pledges were insufficient. Connie Hedegaard, Denmark's climate and energy minister, said leaders "must analyze more carefully" how significant China's pledge is. As for the U.S., said Ms. Hedegaard, the bulk of the promised cleanup appears likely to come many years out. 
Both the general idea of capping U.S. emissions and the details of how that cap might be structured remain hugely contentious in the U.S., pitting different regions of the country, and different industries, against each other. 
The White House said its target reductions are conditional on Congressional approval. But that wasn't enough for some lawmakers. Sen. James Webb (D., Va.) sent a letter Wednesday to the White House expressing "concern" that U.S. officials "may be intending to commit" the U.S. to an emissions cap at the Copenhagen conference before Congress agrees to anything. Sen. Webb is one of several Democrats from states with significant coal-mining or heavy-industry interests who have expressed opposition to the climate proposals backed by Democrats from coastal states. 
Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate envoy, said his country now expects "real action" by the West before the Copenhagen conference on funding and technical support to slow the growth in Chinese emissions. So far, he said, such support hasn't materialized. 
China said the West also has failed to live up to its own emission-cutting promises so far. Europe imposed rules capping emissions from much of its industry in 2005, but to date its reductions haven't matched its promises, Chinese officials said. 
Emissions through 2008 of the EU nations are down more than 10% since 1990, more than halfway to the target of a 20% cut by 2020. 
The pledges by the U.S. and China followed a development in recent days that many analysts said could erode public support for expensive policies to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Hacked emails from an influential U.K. climate-science lab suggest that researchers there tried to squelch scientific challenges to what has become scientific consensus: that human beings are largely responsible for climate change. 
The emails were hacked from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. They suggest that many scientists around the world were concerned about the policy implications of a recent decline in average global temperatures. Although global temperatures remain among the hottest on record, they have declined since 2005, according to various measurements. 
Opponents of significant curbs on greenhouse-gas emissions have pointed to the disclosed emails as reason to pause before implementing any broad policies.

Abstract 
Following weeks of discussions between the government and opposition Liberal-National coalition negotiators, Mr. Rudd and Climate Change Minister Penny Wong offered seven billion Australian dollars (US$6.48 billion) in compensation, including loan guarantees and other assistance for coal miners, electricity generators, liquefied natural-gas projects and others. 

Full text 
CANBERRA -- Australia's opposition leader said he will rally support to pass a government plan to cap the country's greenhouse-gas emissions after Prime Minister Kevin Rudd agreed to key compromises aimed at placating critics of the effort. 
If Australia's Parliament passes the carbon plan into law -- which now appears likely -- in a vote scheduled this week, Mr. Rudd will have achieved a significant political victory as other nations struggle to contain carbon emissions world-wide. 
A similar plan has moved slowly in the U.S. Senate, and talks between world leaders to carve out a new global pact to replace the Kyoto Protocol in Copenhagen next month appear unlikely to yield a binding deal. 
Australia is the biggest per-capita polluter in the developed world because it uses fossil fuels, chiefly coal, for around 90% of its electricity generation. Like the U.S., it is a heavily industrialized economy that has previously resisted capping emissions for fear it could crimp economic growth. 
Australia accounts for only about 1.5% of global emissions, so any such program would be largely symbolic in terms of the broader global picture. But it would put further pressure on countries such as the U.S. to accelerate their plans to approve carbon-reduction schemes. One of Mr. Rudd's first acts in office in 2007 was to add Australia to the signatories of the Kyoto Protocol, isolating the U.S. as the only major developed economy not bound by mandatory caps. 
Following weeks of discussions between the government and opposition Liberal-National coalition negotiators, Mr. Rudd and Climate Change Minister Penny Wong offered seven billion Australian dollars (US$6.48 billion) in compensation, including loan guarantees and other assistance for coal miners, electricity generators, liquefied natural-gas projects and others. They also offered to permanently exclude agriculture from the program. 
Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull said the government made the offers on the condition that its carbon program would pass this year. The opposition leader said the plan is "good for the environment, it is good for farmers, and it offers us one of the best near-term opportunities for carbon-dioxide abatement." 
The plan still faces some opposition, including from mining companies and some environmentalists who believe the latest compromises weaken the plan. But Mr. Turnbull's support increases the odds a plan will be approved. Although the governing Labor Party won a majority in Australia's lower house of representatives at the last election, it needs the support of at least seven opposition senators in the country's upper house to pass any new laws -- a number Mr. Turnbull is expected to deliver. 
If passed, the government plan will see Australia introduce in July 2011 a market-based carbon-trading program similar to one operating in Europe since 2005, forcing the nation's biggest polluters to pay for their greenhouse-gas emissions. The aim, by 2020, is to reduce Australia's emissions by at least 5% from levels at the turn of the century. 
Environment groups and industry were united in their skepticism toward Tuesday's deal. Sen. Bob Brown, whose environmentalist Greens Party holds five seats in the upper house Senate, described it as a "black day for the environment," adding that Mr. Rudd has "caved in to the big polluters" at the expense of households. The Greens are expected to vote against the plan. 
Meanwhile, the coal industry continued to hold out for a better deal. Queensland Resources Council Chief Executive Michael Roche said the latest compensation package for coal -- which saw government support doubled to A$1.5 billion over five years, mainly in the form of free permits for carbon emissions -- represents less than 10% of the A$14.5 billion cost the coal industry faces over the next decade if the carbon program is established. Concessions to miners also is a large part of the U.S. debate. 
"Every ton of coal not produced in Australia as a result of this tax will simply be produced by our competitors, who are not being penalized in the same way by their governments," Mr. Roche said. 
Opposition lawmakers rejected an earlier version of the legislation in August. Key changes since then include making 75% more free permits for carbon emissions available to electricity generators, and extending the compensation period for the sector to 10 years from five years in a package now valued at A$7.3 billion, up from around A$3.9 billion.

Federal renewable-energy legislation may create headaches for coal-heavy electric companies like Southern Co., but the power producer hopes its pursuit of biomass energy projects will help to ease the pain. 
As Congress debates an energy law that could require electric companies to derive a portion of the power they produce from renewable sources, Atlanta-based Southern is taking steps to reduce its emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for climate change. 
The company has committed to reducing its carbon emissions 80% by 2050. One way it aims to reduce carbon-dioxide output is by converting some of its coal-fired plants to biomass plants that run on wood shavings, sawdust or other wood waste. 
"The renewable-energy legislation being debated over the past few years has certainly elevated renewables, including biomass, to a higher priority in our research department," said Tom Johnson, Southern's manager of renewable-energy technology. 
Southern plans to switch the 96-megawatt Plant Mitchell in Georgia, owned by Southern subsidiary Georgia Power, to biomass. The company is also considering converting five additional coal plants to biomass. One megawatt typically powers about 1,000 homes, although the number varies regionally. 
Although the six plants would represent only a small portion of the 77 fossil-fuel plants operated by Southern's power-generation unit, converting coal to biomass can bring about meaningful reductions in carbon emissions and is often more cost-effective than adding environmental controls to aging coal units, said Mark Barnett, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. The carbon dioxide emitted from a biomass plant roughly equals the amount of CO2 absorbed during the growth of the trees or crops that the plant burns for fuel, which means biomass plants produce almost no net carbon emissions. 
Southern is also building new wood-fired plants, breaking ground on the 100-megawatt Nacogdoches biomass plant in Texas earlier this month. Southern estimates the plant will cost $475 million to $500 million. 
A handful of other large power companies, including FirstEnergy Corp. and Xcel Energy Inc., are converting coal plants to biomass, but Southern is among the first to do so. 
Renewable-energy requirements, whether mandated by state or federal government, would increase Southern's cost of producing power by forcing the company to build more renewable-energy projects or buy renewable power from other electricity generators. Southern's earnings wouldn't be directly affected because, as a regulated utility, it can recover such costs by charging ratepayers. 
If a renewable-energy mandate results in a dramatic increase in Southern's electric rates, the company's relationship with regulators could deteriorate, making it more difficult for Southern to recover costs in the future. 
"Southern's rates are very low compared to the rest of the nation, but any rate increase is a very politically sensitive issue," said Morningstar's Barnett. 
Biomass is a viable renewable-energy option for Southern's service territory in the U.S. Southeast, which doesn't have the wind and solar energy resources that other regions possess, Mr. Johnson of Southern said.

Abstract 
[...] to that point, is that the vast majority of global energy comes from fossil fuels, and is predicted to continue to stay that way for several decades. Today, we know that we don't have any system allowing you to store energy, which means that when you invest in capacity, you invest in function of the peak consumption. Because if you don't invest in function of the peak consumption, you're going to create a situation of blackouts, which are very damaging.\n 

Full Text 
After decades of drifting, the U.S. is moving toward a more-coherent energy policy. For the energy industry, that is both a boon and a threat. The broad goals of any new legislation and regulation are clear enough: to cushion the volatility of energy prices and curb greenhouse-gas emissions. But the details are fuzzy, and those details will determine whom the energy transformation helps and hurts. Figuring that federal limits on greenhouse-gas emissions are inevitable, for instance, the industry wants the rules to come from Congress rather than from the Environmental Protection Agency. The reason: It thinks it can lobby Congress to cushion the blow more easily than it can lobby the EPA. 
Jeffrey Ball, the Journal's environment editor, moderated the task-force discussion on energy and the environment. Here are edited excerpts of the presentation of their priorities to the CEO Council. 
JEFFREY BALL: There were a couple of broad pieces that I think are important to reflect -- areas that the group thought were underappreciated. One is that people tend not to understand the scales that are the reality in the energy industry, that different areas of energy supply get thrown around without an appreciation of what really powers this world of ours. 
Second to that point, is that the vast majority of global energy comes from fossil fuels, and is predicted to continue to stay that way for several decades. And third, in terms of using energy more efficiently, it's probably not prudent to suggest that people are going to change their behavior of their own volition. And so there are going to have to be more structural reforms in the economic setup of the energy industry. 
Let me just ask Lynn Elsenhans to talk about the first priority, which has to do with domestic energy supply. 
LYNN ELSENHANS: To put this in context, the EIA [Energy Information Administration] forecasts that energy demand globally of all types will grow more than 50% in 20 years, and that in the U.S. it will grow as much as 30%. And further, petroleum will be 60% of total demand, and, if you put all fossil fuels in there, it's probably over 80% of the demand. 
So anything that doesn't address that is really going to ignore some fundamental problems if we're going to keep energy both secure and affordable, along with clean. 
The key concepts that were put forward on this point were, one, the concept of diversification. We need it all. We have a lot of demand out there. To keep it secure, affordable, we need to develop it all. The second point is more of an emphasis on domestic resources and the development of domestic resources. Most countries in the world do take the resources they have and make the most of them, and the U.S. should do the same. 
We have vast resources of coal. We now have, through new technologies, vast resources of natural gas. If we had more access, we could have additional oil and gas from both conventional and unconventional sources. And yes, if we're going to have clean energy and zero emissions, we have to vastly expand the amount of nuclear energy in this country, and we should embrace all forms of renewable energy. 
MR. BALL: The second priority had to do with efficiency broadly defined. 
LOUIS CHENEVERT: We had a discussion that suggests that at all levels in the supply chain, as well as in the consumer end, there's opportunities to substantially improve efficiency, as well as emissions. 
We had discussions on what can be done with coal power plants or traditional plants to improve their emissions. Technology is available today. It's a question, sometimes, of return on investment and having a level playing field and knowing that you can get return for the investments that you'll put in. 
The same is true, whether it's residential or commercial buildings. 
There's a lot of technology available today that could reduce energy consumption substantially, and there's a need for labeling, for regulation that would force, basically, the adoption of some of these technologies that would have substantial impact on energy and the environment. In the discussion, I noted the fact that for large buildings, the recipe is there today to reduce consumption by 70%. Thirty percent is available easily -- it's probably got less than a five-year payback. 
CARLOS GHOSN: If I can add one point to what has been said about energy efficiency, the ability to store energy is absolutely important. 
Today, we know that we don't have any system allowing you to store energy, which means that when you invest in capacity, you invest in function of the peak consumption. Because if you don't invest in function of the peak consumption, you're going to create a situation of blackouts, which are very damaging. 
So I think focusing and developing capacity to store energy for individuals, for facilities, for public services, for plants is absolutely fundamental to have a much higher efficiency in terms of use of energy. 
MR. BALL: There was an interesting discussion about what policies would be necessary to induce moves toward efficiency. And one of the discussions was whether there ought to be a call for higher energy prices -- that is, a direct call as opposed to a sort of less-direct call in the form of a cap-and-trade policy. There was a feeling that this group did not want to call for higher energy taxes, but that cap-and-trade was going to do that. 
So why don't we move into that -- the third priority. There were those in the group who didn't want to recommend anything on carbon regulation, and indeed, who thought that the best policy would be no government action to restrict carbon emissions. 
There was a larger group that felt it didn't really matter what the group wanted in that regard, because carbon regulations are coming, and so the group ought to make some suggestion as to what is the lesser of two evils. 
There were a few points of agreement here. 
First of all, that the EPA should not be regulating carbon emissions -- that this ought to be up to Congress to act. 
Second, that remembering in the design of any cap-and-trade system that fossil fuels provide about 80% of global energy today, and are likely to continue to do that. And so to the degree that a cap-and-trade program incentivizes a diversity of energy resources, it needs to keep that reality in mind. 
And third and really important, the point of global competitiveness -- that the U.S. should not do anything on carbon regulations in the absence of action by other countries, particularly countries in the developing world. 
MR. CHENEVERT: With regard to upgrading the electrical grid, there are so many roadblocks to overcome that eventually, it gets frustrating and it's always sub-optimized. If we're going to really succeed at energy efficiency, and the introduction of renewables, without an efficient grid it's not going to happen. So this is something that's a very high priority for the group and it's something that needs to be addressed fairly quickly if we're going to make substantial changes in the efficiency of the whole system. 
MR. BALL: This was one area in which there was really no disagreement on the desire for increased federal control. It was very interesting that if the government is going to essentially demand that energy resources be diversified, it has to give business the tools to make that happen. 
MR. GHOSN: On the fifth recommendation, the main point about transportation is the fact that today in the U.S, and in practically all the developed or developing countries, we're all net importers of oil. 
Second, it is the only fuel for transportation. That means that if there is a problem with oil, the whole transportation system is paralyzed. And we came to the conclusion that oil is not the enemy, but too much dependence on oil becomes something that is very precarious. 
So by saying diversify the transport system, we're saying, because it's a strategic consideration and also an economic consideration, a lot of effort should be made -­partnerships between governments, states, municipalities, companies, car companies, utility companies -- in order to find the best system adapted to the country or adapted to a specific city to bring electricity as a diversification from oil for transportation. 
MR. BALL: There was a sense in the group that this was a particularly interesting area for actual business-government cooperation. 
MR. GHOSN: Exactly. This is something that cannot happen because one company wants it or because one municipality or one government wants it. You need the technology, so you need the technology of the battery, you need technology from car makers, you need utilities to step in. 
In fact, you know, we're signing a lot of agreements with the utility companies across the globe who are saying, well, this is an opportunity for us to increase our market share or increase our presence. 
You need governments to be interested in putting their acts behind their will of being less dependent on oil or creating an environment where you have less emissions. And in fact, we're seeing today very clearly which are the governments and the municipalities standing up and saying OK, what do you need for this to become a reality? What kind of infrastructure, what kind of partner do you need? Without partnership, it can't work. 
ALAN MURRAY: Ed Markey is the chairman of the special select committee that the House of Representatives established to deal with climate-change issues. You've had a chance to look over the recommendations; you've heard some of what they had to say. 
EDWARD MARKEY: I agree with your plan. I think that the priorities that you have selected are the most important ones, which is why each one of them is included inside of the Waxman-Markey legislation. 
We have a broad array of incentives for all energy sources. On promoting energy, we include the largest single increase in funding for energy efficiency in any legislation in the history of our country. 
We include a requirement that all new buildings have to be 50% more efficient in their energy consumption by the year 2016 -- dramatic increases in appliance efficiency. We give $10 billion each year to the states to incentivize efficiency within their states. 
We have passed a cap-and-trade bill. I think many of the executives who are represented here feel comfortable with that because they're already doing business in Europe, which has a system in place. 
I think there's a higher comfort level, the larger the company, in terms of moving in this cap-and-trade direction. 
We built billions of dollars of funding into Waxman-Markey for the smart grid, as we did into the stimulus package in February to telescope the time frame it will take for our nation to lay this out. 
And finally, diversifying the transportation system: We moved, with incentives as well, more toward using natural gas as a source of energy, especially in the bus and the large truck fleet. 
MS. ELSENHANS: Congressman, I'm a refiner and one of the principles that was put forward is what the task force said was a level playing field and not picking winners and losers. 
There are many very good features about the bill, and I applaud those, but you've clearly picked refiners as a loser. 
And you talk about Europe and being like Europe -- well, it's not like Europe at all, because the Europeans got all the allowances for nothing and the European refiners were not responsible for the emissions of their customers. They were only responsible for their stationary emissions. 
I fear that what we're doing is, we're basically going to disadvantage all U.S. refiners, all U.S. heavy industry -- energy-intensive industries -- and force those industries overseas. And so what we're going to do is end up trading off importing oil for importing products, and in the meantime, transporting jobs -- good-paying jobs -- from the U.S., overseas. 
I will only speak for my company. I'm very willing to have my stationary emissions be part of cap-and-trade and learn how to be more energy efficient. 
But asking us to also handle the emissions of our customers puts us in great peril. And basically, our ability to cap-and-trade is going to be more important than our ability to 
transform crude oil into products and deliver those products to our customers. 
REP. MARKEY: We put about $2.5 billion per year in the deal with the additional cost for the refining industry, but that's still subject to negotiation as the bill moves through the 

Senate. 

In addition, we actually put in a border tariff that is triggered in 2020 that will protect energy-intensive, trade-vulnerable industries from exploitation by China or India or other 
countries who are not engaging in the same kind of reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions that we are, so that there's a real signal being sent to the rest of the world. 
We're not going to stand by and watch our steel, aluminum, cement and other energy-intensive industries get exploited by us moving along with the Europeans. 
I think we have to be realistic here as we're going forward so that we are building in the protections for those energy-intensive industries. 
MR. CHENEVERT: Congressman, how do you see overcoming some of the challenges on this electrical grid, because there are municipalities involved, there are people who don't 

like to see a hydro tower in the back of their homes, and you've got the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that's involved? 

That was the debate that we were having this morning on the difficulty of actually siting and implementing the electrical grid, and do you see anything that can be done to 
accelerate that process and, therefore, welcome the renewables, for example, into the communities? 
REP. MARKEY: The Obama administration has put together an interagency task force for the first time so that there's coordination in the siting of these energy facilities. They 

clearly are intending on unleashing this renewable energy agenda.

The Top Five Recommendations These related articles from MIT Sloan Management Review can be accessed online at sloanreview.mit.edu/wsj 
1.
 DIVERSIFY U.S. ENERGY 

The U.S. should encourage all domestic energy supplies, including coal, expanded access to oil and gas coming from both conventional and unconventional sources, nuclear power and all renewables. Government shouldn't pick winners; let the markets decide. 

2.
 PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY 

Establish a holistic approach, supported by business, that produces energy efficiencies, from production to consumption. Policies should include tax credits, accelerated depreciation, altered building codes and performance standards. Change utility regulatory structure so utilities can recover cost of investments. Educate consumers about energy-efficiency methods. 

3.
 CAP-AND-TRADE BILL 

Instead of the EPA regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, Congress should set a cap on carbon emissions that protects the U.S. economy. The cap should recognize that most energy will continue to come from fossil fuels. The U.S. should not act alone on global warming. There should be a trigger requiring a global framework. 

4.
 FEDERAL PLAN FOR ELECTRIC GRID 

Congress should enact federal authority to deploy a more efficient electric grid that enables the diversification of U.S. energy supplies, gives the federal government more authority to site transmission lines through eminent domain and gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the power to allocate costs. 

5.
 DIVERSIFY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 


In its tax, regulatory, and investment policies, the government should stimulate transportation systems consistent with the broad goals of diversifying energy sources and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

Abstract 
SUSTAINABLE JOB CREATION Government should focus on policies that stimulate sustainable job growth by identifying national competitive strengths, encouraging innovation, reforming tax policy and avoiding regulatory disincentives. 

Full Text 
The CEOs divided into four task forces and debated priorities in the areas of health care, energy and the environment, finance and the U.S. economy, and education. Using an electronic ranking system devised by the Journal, they chose five top priorities in each subject area. 
Each task force then reported its priorities back to the full council. At the end of the conference, the chief executives revised and then ranked all the priorities from the four task forces, in order of their relative urgency and importance. 
The CEOs who attended the session were from a diverse range of industries; as a group, they employ more than six million people and represent roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization. That should give their views on these issues some added weight in the months ahead. 
Here's a look at their top five priorities. 
1.
 SUSTAINABLE JOB CREATION 

Government should focus on policies that stimulate sustainable job growth by identifying national competitive strengths, encouraging innovation, reforming tax policy and avoiding regulatory disincentives. Policies should emphasize small and medium-sized enterprises and ensure the flow of credit to business. Government should avoid short-term efforts to create jobs that are unsustainable. 

2.
 EDUCATION IS A TOP NATIONAL PRIORITY 

Education is an urgent national priority -- well ahead of health care, climate change and financial regulatory reform -- and government and business policies need to reflect that. If we don't address this, we endanger our children, economy, businesses and national security. 

3.
 TAX REFORM 
Change the tax code, in revenue-neutral fashion, to encourage savings and investment and discourage consumption and debt over the long term. 


4.
 DIVERSIFY U.S. ENERGY SUPPLY 


The U.S. should encourage all domestic energy supplies, including coal, expanded access to oil and gas from both conventional and unconventional sources, nuclear power and all renewables. Government shouldn't pick winners; let the markets decide. 

5.
 REFORM MEDICAL MALPRACTICE 
Cap awards and legal fees, and create health courts.

U.S. News: Senate to Put Off Climate Bill Until Spring

Abstract 
Legislation on health care, overhauling financial markets and job creation will be considered before the Senate takes up a measure to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to climate change, Senate Democratic leaders said Tuesday. 

Full Text 
Senate Democratic leaders said Tuesday they would put off debate on a big climate-change bill until spring, in a sign of weakening political will to tackle a long-term 
environmental issue at a time of high unemployment and economic uncertainty. 
Legislation on health care, overhauling financial markets and job creation will be considered before the Senate takes up a measure to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
gases linked to climate change, Senate Democratic leaders said Tuesday. 

Climate legislation will be taken up "some time in the spring," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Tuesday after a Democratic caucus meeting. 

The delay was "just a matter of reality, they can't get anything done at this time," said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who has previously supported climate legislation. He has 
said he wouldn't support the current Senate proposal because of disagreements over its handling of nuclear energy. 
The climate-bill delay sidetracks one of President Barack Obama's top domestic priorities. Mr. Obama has said action to curb greenhouse gases would unleash investment in 

clean-energy technology and create jobs. 
White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said Tuesday Mr. Obama was working with lawmakers to move the legislation as quickly as possible. 
"This is an economic opportunity for the nation that will create millions of clean energy jobs while reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and it's an opportunity that 

other countries like China and India are racing to take advantage of," Mr. LaBolt said in an email. 

Momentum for a climate bill has been undermined by fears that capping carbon-dioxide emissions -- the inevitable product of burning oil and coal -- would slow economic 
growth, raise energy costs and compel changes in the way Americans live. 
"It's really big, really, really hard, and is going to make a lot of people mad," said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.). 
Democrats looking ahead to the 2010 midterm elections are concerned about a backlash from voters in industrial and heartland states dependent on coal. Republicans are 

portraying Democrats'"cap and trade" proposals, which call for capping overall U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions and allowing companies to buy and trade permits to emit those 

gases, as a "cap and tax" scheme. 
Meanwhile, the administration is moving ahead with a plan to have the Environmental Protection Agency declare greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, a danger to public 
health. That would trigger potential regulations that could affect a wide swath of the economy. 

Earlier this week, Mr. Obama and other world leaders scaled back ambitions for a global climate summit next month in Copenhagen. 
United Nations leaders had called for a new, binding global agreement in Copenhagen to set caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. But at a meeting in Asia, leaders including Mr. 

Obama said they would try instead to use the Copenhagen gathering to forge an agreement that is "politically binding," with specific commitments by countries to reduce emissions and help poor countries fight climate change. A legally binding deal would come later; diplomats point to mid-to-late-2010. The Senate Finance Committee likely won't begin deliberations on the climate bill until January, according to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), one of its sponsors. The bill was 
passed by the environment panel earlier this month. 
The Commerce Committee may also weigh in on some of the bill's provisions. The panel's chairman, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.V.), is opposed to strong emissions limits. 
"By the time we turn around, it's March," Ms. Boxer said of the likely timetable. 
The House of Representatives narrowly passed its version of a climate bill in June, with dozens of Democratic lawmakers from industrial and coal-dependent states voting no.

Abstract 
Since August, Duke Energy has signed deals with two Chinese companies that focus on solar-power development in the U.S. and methods to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants. 

Full Text 
Some of the biggest names in the U.S. power industry are teaming up with Chinese partners, seeking access to the cash, equipment and technology offered by China's fast-growing energy sector. 
The alliances, made by such heavyweights as Duke Energy Corp., AES Corp. and Progress Energy Inc., could open the U.S. market to Chinese companies in ways that otherwise wouldn't be possible. That's because utilities still operate as monopolies in much of the U.S., controlling the local market for equipment and technology. 
Since August, Duke Energy has signed deals with two Chinese companies that focus on solar-power development in the U.S. and methods to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants. 
Duke Chief Executive Jim Rogers said these deals are just the beginning, and that he may solicit Chinese financing for the $25 billion in capital Duke needs to raise in the next five years to build new plants and upgrade other facilities. 
As President Barack Obama meets with Chinese officials this week, tamping down carbon-dioxide emissions is on the agenda. The U.S. and China together account for 40% of the world's output of the gas, the leading culprit in global warming. The two nations' talks are expected to explore ways they can cooperate to solve common problems, such as making coal a cleaner-burning fuel. 
Some U.S. power companies have already reached out to their Chinese counterparts. Duke's Mr. Rogers said he thinks Chinese companies are more likely than their U.S. counterparts to build big factories and develop the new technologies needed to wring carbon out of the economy. 
They also have deep pockets. U.S. utilities will have to refinance about $100 billion of debt coming due in 2011 and 2012, and Moody's Investor's Service said last week they will need to consider alternatives to "traditional bank credit" which could remain "constrained." 
In August, Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., signed a memorandum of understanding with China's biggest state-owned utility, China Huaneng, to share information about clean-coal technology. China gets 80% of its electricity from coal, and Duke gets about 70%, so both have incentive to act. 
Duke is building a coal-gasification power plant in Indiana and may try to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from the plant. China Huaneng is building a coal-gasification plant in Tianjin. Duke estimates it will have taken it eight years to get its Indiana plant built, but that Tianjin will build its plant in three years. "When they want to do something, they just get it done," said David Mohler, Duke's chief technology officer. 
Last month, Duke agreed to work with ENN Group, a Chinese gas-distribution and solar-power company in eastern China, to develop commercial solar projects in the U.S. Under the deal, ENN would furnish equipment and Duke would run the plants. 
President Obama's energy policy aims in part to invigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector by developing new energy technology. Mr. Rogers said he understands that using Chinese-made equipment may undermine that goal. But he said erosion of the U.S. manufacturing base "is irreversible. There's nothing I can do" since China's domestic market is so huge that it automatically guarantees economies of scale. 
Progress Energy, which is planning to build two new nuclear plants by 2019, recently agreed to share information with Shangdong Nuclear Power Co., a unit of China Power Investment Corp. Shangdong Nuclear has started construction of a Westinghouse AP1000 reaactor, the type Progress plans to build. Bill Johnson, CEO of Progress Energy, Raleigh, N.C., said his team wants to learn all it can from China's construction experience to avoid pitfalls. In return, Progress will share its expertise in safely operating nuclear plants. 
When it comes time to seek financing for its new reactors, Progress "would be interested in capital from anywhere," Mr. Johnson said. 
Earlier this month, AES agreed to sell a 15% equity stake to China Investment Corp., China's sovereign wealth fund, for $1.58 billion. It also agreed to sell a 35% share of its wind-development business to CIC for $571 million. AES, based in Arlington, Va., said it is possible the arrangement will result in greater use of Chinese-made equipment in coming years. 
Not everyone is eager to find a Chinese partner. Mike Morris, chief executive of Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power Co., a company active in clean-coal research, said he is "skittish" about soliciting Chinese capital. 
Mr. Morris said Chinese companies can be nimble in part because China's people "have no voice" in resource planning, whereas public participation is a key part of U.S. utility and environmental proceedings.

Abstract 
According to official statistics, Texas produces more CO2 than any other state and even countries like Canada, but the report says the state posted the second-biggest drop in absolute emissions in the U.S. after New York over the period. 

Full Text 
Texas, the nation's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, is also leading the U.S. in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels due to lower industrial demand and the spread of renewable power. 
A recent report by environmental non-profit Environment Texas says the Lone Star state saw its CO2 output decline 2% between 2004 and 2007. 
According to official statistics, Texas produces more CO2 than any other state and even countries like Canada, but the report says the state posted the second-biggest drop in 
absolute emissions in the U.S. after New York over the period. 

The report says that most of the drop is from declining natural gas consumption in the industrial sector -- but a significant part of it is also because of lower emissions from the 
electrical sector. 
Texas saw its power generation emissions drop by 4% between 2004 and 2007 as providers switched from coal to natural gas-fired plants and wind farms. 

While the reductions are far from quelling worries about global warming, the findings underscore the state's paradoxical role in the world's energy landscape. 
Texas is the heart of America's petroleum industry, and its conservative political leadership is waging war against the Obama administration's plan to put a cap on carbon 
emissions that could crimp oil and gas industry jobs.But windy prairies and a laissez-faire approach toward business have also given clean technology a hefty boost. 

In less than a decade, Texas has become by far the foremost wind producer in the U.S. Credit: By Angel Gonzalez

Full Text 
NEW DELHI -- India plans to announce increased subsidies for solar-power generation, a senior government official said, as the country looks to boost production of renewable energy and show it is committed to mitigating climate change. 
India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is expected to release details of the latest solar-power policy in the next weeks. In an interview, Dr. B. Bhargava, a director in the agency, said the plans will significantly increase the number of solar projects that can receive government support. 
The hope, he said, is that the new policy will encourage manufacturers of solar panels such as Moser Baer India Ltd. and Tata BP Solar India Ltd. to ramp up production, thereby reducing per-unit costs and driving down the high price of solar power. 
It is now about five times as expensive to generate solar power than oil-based power. "If the costs aren't reduced, this [subsidy] policy can't be sustained on a long-term basis," Mr. Bhargava said. 
Climate change will be among the issues on the agenda when Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visits the White House next week. 
India generates a tiny fraction of its power from solar energy. Coal accounts for more than half of the country's power capacity, and wind makes the biggest contribution among renewable sources, which together provide about 7.5% of India's energy. 
Solar power is promising, because sunlight is abundant across the country, unlike wind and hydro power, which are better for only some regions. The government's new policy is aimed at increasing solar-power generation to 20,000 megawatts by 2020 from three megawatts. "The potential is infinite with solar," Mr. Bhargava said. 
India's existing policy supports a modest amount of solar-power capacity -- 50 megawatts -- with subsidies of up to 25 cents per kilowatt hour. Mr. Bhargava said that program is already "fully subscribed" and will be expanded substantially, though he declined to offer specifics. He said the new guidelines also will streamline the process for solar-power developers to collect subsidies and payments from state utilities. 
Beyond expanding solar power, India has pledged in a "national action plan" on climate change to pursue a range of other measures, from increased fuel-efficiency in automobiles to more-efficient consumer appliances.

Abstract 
Alternative producers need to see the right signals from policy makers before they will make decisions to invest billions of dollars in alternative-energy sources," said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which acts as an adviser to industrialized nations like the U.S. "Copenhagen is where those signals need to come from. 

Full Text 
An acknowledgment by the world's biggest governments that they won't reach a climate-change agreement by next month underscores the political challenges of negotiating such a deal -- and raises questions about when they might do so. 
Leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over the weekend conceded that the United Nations conference on climate change, to be held in Copenhagen in December, wasn't likely to reach a legal agreement imposing hard caps on countries' greenhouse-gas emissions. By doing so, the leaders tacitly acknowledged that neither the 
U.S. nor China -- the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases -- was ready to commit to such a deal. The two countries have been locked in a standoff for years over the issue, with each wanting the other to shoulder more of the burden of cutting emissions. 
World leaders now say they hope to use the Copenhagen meeting to forge a "politically binding" agreement, with specific commitments by countries to reduce emissions and to help poor countries fight climate change. The leaders would seek to reach a formal, legal agreement at a second conference, but the timing of that remains uncertain. 
Some longtime observers of climate negotiation expressed concern that by tamping down expectations for next month's summit, world leaders have eased pressure on concluding a deal anytime soon. They said a protracted delay would make it harder to reduce carbon emissions down the road, because wind and other alternative-energy producers want to see political and legal commitments in public policy before making additional investments. 
In the interim, energy companies are likely to continue relying on cheaper but dirtier fuel sources, such as coal-fired power plants, to meet rising energy needs. Newly built projects could operate for decades. 
"Alternative producers need to see the right signals from policy makers before they will make decisions to invest billions of dollars in alternative-energy sources," said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which acts as an adviser to industrialized nations like the U.S. "Copenhagen is where those signals need to come from." 
The Copenhagen announcement also illustrates the political difficulty of negotiating limits on industrial greenhouse-gas emissions, as countries grapple with a weak global economy and concerns that emission caps could drive up energy prices. 
During the U.S. presidential campaign, Barack Obama pledged to push for legislation capping U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, raising hopes among environmentalists that Copenhagen would produce an agreement. In Japan, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's election brought to power a new government that pledged to make deeper emissions cuts than its predecessor. And Chinese President Hu Jintao proposed in September to adopt "carbon-intensity targets," which would set the amount of carbon released per unit of economic output. 
But political opposition in the U.S. Senate to Mr. Obama's climate-change proposals and continuing resistance among developing countries to binding emissions-reduction targets have slowed consensus ahead of the Copenhagen summit. China's offer to set targets has failed to mollify some U.S. lawmakers, with Republicans arguing that China's emissions would to continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate. 
Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen over the weekend laid out new goals for the Copenhagen summit. He said leaders should produce a five- to eight-page text with "precise language" committing developed countries to reductions of emissions thought to be warming the planet; and with provisions on adapting to warmer temperatures, on financing such adaptation and combating climate change in poor countries. It would include pledges of immediate financing for early action. 
"We are not aiming to let anyone off the hook," Mr. Rasmussen told the leaders. "We are trying to create a framework that will allow everybody to commit." 
But the leaders didn't specify when a final summit would be convened to ratify such a treaty. 
Greenpeace International accused Denmark's government of "caving in" to the U.S. and complained that industrialized countries "continue to postpone important decisions into eternity." 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce applauded Mr. Rasmussen for making what it said was a smart, pragmatic move.

Abstract 
Pending climate-change legislation restricting emissions of greenhouse gases hangs over the whole industry, because coal-fired power plants are major emitters of carbon dioxide. 

Full text 
Montana could soon open substantial reserves to mining in the nation's largest coal basin, with top elected officials set to vote on a lease proposal on Monday. 
The state could lease rights to an estimated 616 million tons of recoverable reserves in the Otter Creek region in southeastern Montana. The state holdings are interspersed with an estimated 731 million tons of privately held reserves for which Arch Coal Inc. announced last week it has acquired leases. 
The Arch Coal deal and proposed state lease sale highlight new interest in a state whose production has traditionally been overshadowed by neighboring Wyoming. The two states share a massive coal formation known as the Powder River Basin, which accounts for more than 40% of U.S. coal output. 
Interest in the Montana coal comes even as U.S. producers face weak prices amid a supply glut. But coal companies and state officials expect steady demand in years to come for Montana's coal, which can be extracted from low-cost surface mines. Declining production at existing mines elsewhere in the country, new power-plant construction, technological advances at existing plants and possible exports to Asia all are expected to support demand. 
"I can't say how many bids we may have, but there has been interest," said Mary Sexton, director of Montana's Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. 
The Otter Creek reserves come with challenges. Montana coal tends to have a higher sodium content than Wyoming coal, traditionally limiting the number of power plants that can burn it. Ms. Sexton said the Otter Creek region also needs an estimated 90 miles of new railroad track to connect it with existing lines. Pending climate-change legislation restricting emissions of greenhouse gases hangs over the whole industry, because coal-fired power plants are major emitters of carbon dioxide. 
For Otter Creek, officials have been developing a process to lease the state reserves since the start of the decade, when Montana received the reserves from the federal government. Final approval could come Monday, when the State Board of Land Commissioners meets on the lease proposal. The board is made up of top state officials, including Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer. 
It isn't clear exactly what the board will do at this point as it weighs several issues, including whether it is a good time to sell reserves in a weak economy, said Mike Volesky, natural-resources policy adviser for Gov. Schweitzer. 
He said the state doesn't plan to stand in the way of Arch Coal's development of the new reserves it now has. Money from the state lease sale and production royalties that would follow primarily go toward funding education in the state. 
Arch Coal said last week that it reached a lease agreement covering an estimated 9,600 acres with privately held Great Northern Properties LP in a deal that includes a front-end bonus of 10 cent a ton, or $73.1 million, to be paid over five years. 
A spokeswoman for Arch Coal on Friday said the company won't need the state leases to develop its new reserves.

The International Energy Agency used its annual World Energy Outlook as a platform to argue the case for a major international agreement on stemming global warming, saying it is needed to avoid sharply higher oil and gas importing costs as well as climate change. 
The IEA suggested a strong agreement at a summit in Copenhagen next month could help make the difference between the Earth's temperatures rising as much as six degrees Celsius -- a figure at the high end of most experts' estimates -- and as little as two degrees. A deal on emissions could reduce world oil demand by 16 million barrels a day by 2030, the agency projects. 
Failure to reach such a deal could raise the U.S.'s cost to import oil and gas from 1% to 2% of its gross domestic product, it said. 
The IEA's energy-related forecasts generally carry weight with industrialized nations. But a grand agreement to slash global greenhouse-gas emissions to the extent the IEA is calling for appears unlikely. Countries from the U.S. to China are fighting over who should foot what share of the cleanup bill. 
In the report, the IEA also scaled back its near-term forecast for global oil consumption, predicting it would grow to just 88 million barrels a day over the next five years instead of the 94 million barrels it was forecasting a year ago. That partly reflects increased energy-efficiency measures as well as the effects of the global recession. 
IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol said the agency expects oil prices to climb to more than $100 a barrel by 2015 and to $190 a barrel by 2030 because of the challenges the oil industry faces in finding new resources to meet rising demand. 
The energy industry, responsible for two-thirds of all emissions, is divided over a climate-change pact. Some companies want to remove regulatory uncertainty that has slowed the shift to low-carbon technologies, while others say new mandates would prove too expensive. 
U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass), said Tuesday that Democrats are planning to send a climate-legislation framework to Copenhagen to assure negotiators of Washington's commitment to a treaty. 
The IEA's forecast on the effect of a deal depends on it limiting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent -- the "450 scenario." A number of climate-change activists say even that figure is too high -- because it is higher than the current level of about 380 parts per million. Countries including the U.S. back the 450 scenario on paper, but few analysts expect an agreement in Copenhagen to be that strict -- if agreement is reached at all. 
To achieve that standard, demand for fossil fuels would have to peak by 2020, and a "revolution" occur in electricity generation, with a shift away from coal to natural gas and renewables, the IEA said. It said the price of carbon in Western countries would also have to rise -- to $50 for the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide by 2020 and to $110 a ton by 2030, compared to less than $20 in the current European cap-and-trade market. 
Big change would also be needed in transportation: The number of electric or hybrid cars would have to rise to 60 of every 100 sold by 2030, from just one in 100 currently, the IEA said.

Abstract 
Mr. Obama's reference to France is highly relevant to the controversial issue of how to manage used reactor fuel rods. [...] very recently, the U.S. government and nuclear energy utilities had planned to place this material in deep storage at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 

Full Text 
As America climbs out of one of its worst recessions in decades, we must keep in mind that long-term economic growth requires an abundant, affordable supply of electricity. 
By 2030, electricity demand in the U.S. is expected to grow by 21% from its current level, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. To meet our needs we have several options. 
One is to increase our dependence on fossil energy sources. Unfortunately, this will only add to the environmental burden caused by burning carbon-based fuels. Another option, the Obama administration's goal, is to increase the supply of energy sources that reduce the country's carbon footprint. These sources include solar, wind, hydro, biofuels and geothermal energy, as well as new domestic sources of natural gas, which burns cleaner than oil or coal. 
Toward that end, the proposed Senate climate-change bill, sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) and John Kerry (D., Mass.), provides incentives to electric companies to use energy sources that reduce carbon emissions. The bill also expands federal loan guarantees to support the financing of new nuclear plant projects. 
These loan guarantees are crucial for providing the financial security that's needed to build advanced nuclear energy plants. These new plants will promote energy independence, improve our country's economic competitiveness, and help provide a cleaner environment for future generations. 
To be sure, the U.S needs to embrace all forms of renewable and sustainable energy technologies whenever possible. But the simple, unavoidable truth is that all renewable energy sources produce only a small percentage of our total electricity output. Wind and solar combined, for example, account for less than 5% of the total U.S. electricity supply. It is doubtful that they can be scaled up to a degree that would make a significant impact on rising electricity demand over the short or intermediate term. 
Greater energy efficiency and conservation also make good business and environmental sense. But a 21% growth in demand for electric power, compounded by the need to replace aging power plants, is too great to satisfy with energy efficiency and conservation alone. 
Nuclear energy, therefore, must play a larger role in our effort to become and remain energy independent, and to reduce carbon emissions. The growth of nuclear power will also have peripheral benefits, as it constitutes an economic stimulus package in and of itself. 
To date, the recent growth of the nuclear energy industry has created at least 15,000 jobs, with many more on the horizon. Westinghouse's work alone in the deployment of four new nuclear plants now under construction in China will create or sustain an additional 5,000 U.S. jobs in 20 states. These jobs are in fields such as engineering and design, and in the manufacturing of fuel rods and assemblies, pumps, motors, circuit breakers, etc. 
Beyond that, the American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness (a trade group) estimates the nuclear energy industry will create as many as 350,000 jobs over the next 20 years, many in traditional building trades (welders, pipe-fitters, construction workers) that have been hard hit by both global competition and the current economic downturn. 
These projections are grounded in reality. To date, 25 new nuclear power plants have been announced for the U.S., 14 of them by Westinghouse. We expect the first of these new plants to come online about 2016. 
Meanwhile, China and India have announced major nuclear power construction programs that will bring as many as 50 new plants online in each country over the next two decades. Nuclear power plants have proven to be the low-cost source of baseload electricity (electricity in large volume that is required all the time, and which is generated essentially only by coal and nuclear fuel). And as countries such as China and India increase the percentage of electricity generated by nuclear energy, American businesses and manufacturing companies will be at a distinct competitive disadvantage if they are forced to rely on electricity generated by comparatively more expensive energy sources. 
President Barack Obama has repeatedly stated his belief that nuclear energy must play an important part in America's energy future, and he supports the Senate climate-change bill. In a town-hall meeting in New Orleans on Oct. 15, the president said: "We need to increase domestic energy production, employ safe nuclear energy like France, but also develop new sources of energy efficiency." 
Mr. Obama's reference to France is highly relevant to the controversial issue of how to manage used reactor fuel rods. Until very recently, the U.S. government and nuclear energy utilities had planned to place this material in deep storage at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. However, because of political considerations, storage at Yucca Mountain will likely never happen. 
Instead, Westinghouse and others in the industry are exploring alternatives such as the recycling of used fuel. This technology, developed in the 1970s, is used in France, which is the world's most nuclear-dependent and energy-independent country. Used fuel rods contain upwards of 85% of their original energy. Tapping this energy through recycling is environmentally sound and consistent with the goal of energy independence. 
With huge new finds of domestic natural gas and a commitment to renewables, the U.S. has never been closer to realizing true energy independence. But to seize this opportunity, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources must be developed in harmony to provide the abundant clean energy that the American economy needs to grow. 
Dr. Candris is president and CEO of Westinghouse Electric Co.

[Billionaires, like little boys, have long liked to play with trains. With his latest purchase, Warren Buffett is on track to be today's Cornelius Vanderbilt.] 
The American railroad produced the nation's original corporate capitalists -- the ones we call tycoons, moguls, or robber barons. The first and greatest was "Commodore" Cornelius Vanderbilt, who amassed the New York Central system between New York and Chicago in the 1860s and '70s. This week's purchase of Burlington Northern by Warren Buffett seems to make Mr. Buffett a worthy successor. 
"It's an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States," Mr. Buffett said of his purchase. "I love these bets." So did Vanderbilt. And Mr. Buffett's wager is on a Vanderbiltian scale. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is paying $26.3 billion in cash and stock for 77.4% of the enormous railroad. (It already owned the rest.) In the Information Age, this is a startling endorsement of the oldest of the old economy. 
Nineteenth century railroads largely created the modern corporate economy. Led by Vanderbilt, they landscaped the playing field that Mr. Buffett now strides across. The tale of the two titans, then, is a tangled story rather than a mere contrast of then and now. 
On Nov. 8, 1833, the 39-year-old Vanderbilt boarded a train. Railroads were new enough that this was notable in itself. The locomotive resembled an oversize barrel thrown on its side, with wheels and a smokestack. The three cars that trailed behind were modeled on stagecoaches, and looked nothing like the rectangular boxes of decades to come. The train pulled out of South Amboy, N.J., and chugged down the Camden & Amboy Railroad. It soon reached the terrifying speed of 25 miles per hour. 
Then an axle broke, pitching the entire train down the embankment. Vanderbilt suffered a punctured lung, multiple fractures, and had the skin torn off his knees. He barely survived. But he did not let it color his feelings. Instead, he only grew more interested in this new business. 
But what kind of business was it -- public or private? The question shadows railroads to this day. The industry Mr. Buffett now enters endured a wave of government takeovers in the 20th century. Amtrak, a federal entity, monopolizes intercity passenger travel. This fraught meeting of public and private has been there from the beginning. 
Take the line that nearly killed Vanderbilt, the Camden & Amboy. It was a privately owned corporation, but New Jersey had granted it special privileges -- in particular, a state monopoly on railroads. At the time, the corporation was generally seen as a form of government intervention in the economy. In order to attract private investment in banks and transportation infrastructure, states chartered corporations with such benefits as limited liability and, as in this case, monopoly rights. That view of corporations had led Adam Smith to condemn them in "The Wealth of Nations" as a shackle on the invisible hand. Radical Jacksonians attacked them as an unjust grant of special privileges to already-wealthy investors. 
States constructed some early railroads, but heavy losses discredited such public investments. As a result, the railroads that sprouted in New England in the 1830s and '40s were privately owned, but lacked the monopoly rights that made the Camden & Amboy so controversial. They still took the corporate form, though, because that was the only practical way to structure such a capital-intensive enterprise. The New England lines helped transform corporations from semi-public works into a rational type of business organization. 
Young Vanderbilt embraced Jacksonian rhetoric. The Hudson River, he wrote in an ad for his steamboat line, "is the great highway of the people, and does not belong exclusively to the Monopolists." Yet he was pragmatic. When he built steamboats to run from New York to New England in the late 1830s, he didn't hesitate to work with railroad corporations. He had to. 
The early lines radiating from Boston lacked the capital to extend to New York. Rather, they laid tracks to Long Island Sound, where water met rail. The sight of sidewheel steamers rocking at the pier, disgorging passengers who raced between piles of trunks and crates to catch the waiting train, became a familiar one in the Northeast. It's no small irony that this reliance on more than one form of transport, such as shipping and rail (known as "intermodal transportation"), was a sign of the weakness of early railroads, but a sign of strength in Mr. Buffett's Burlington Northern, which carries containers from West Coast ports. 
Railroad shares soon dominated trading on the New York Stock Exchange -- which was so small that stocks and bonds were traded one at a time. (After lunch, they ran through the list once more.) Vanderbilt proved a master of emerging Wall Street. In 1847, after a brilliant campaign, he took control of the most admired New England line, the Stonington railroad. 
The California Gold Rush took Vanderbilt out of the Stonington and into steamships. But he never abandoned the railway industry. During the 1850s, he proved a powerful and gifted financier, rescuing both the Erie and the New York & Harlem railroads. Though he lacked the technical knowledge he brought to shipping (he designed his own steamers), he demonstrated a deep understanding of corporate governance and the industry's demands. 
In 1863, he shocked Wall Street by assuming control of the troubled New York & Harlem ("Harlem" for short). But he did so with a keen grasp of its hidden strengths. Mr. Buffett's takeover of Burlington Northern offers a parallel. This railroad was no darling of Wall Street, any more than the Harlem was in 1863. But, like Vanderbilt, Mr. Buffett already held a large stake, and had paid close attention to railroads for years. Now, as the economy struggles, he observes an opportunity to buy a company that will be at the center of the revival. 
Vanderbilt saw a company with a strategic advantage over competitors, as the only line to enter the center of Manhattan. Previously he had helped reduce the Harlem's heavy debt, positioning it to flourish under his own management. Similarly, Mr. Buffett perceives that Burlington Northern, and the railway industry, possess tremendous long-term strengths. Railroads, he noted, move goods "in a very cost efficient way and they do it in an extraordinarily environmentally friendly way." As both fuel prices and global-warming worries rise in the years to come, rail will only grow more attractive, compared to trucking or air. 
But Vanderbilt had to cope with two things Mr. Buffett does not: rampant government corruption, and the fragmentation of the railroad network. In 1863, New York's City Council granted the Harlem a potentially lucrative streetcar franchise on Broadway. The councilmen did so after buying Harlem stock, which skyrocketed on the exchange after their vote. 
They decided that another golden egg could be had, if they choked the goose. They sold Harlem short, then revoked the streetcar franchise. "Commodore Vanderbilt warned the members of the Council of the folly of their trick," reported the New York Herald, and predicted that they would lose more than they would make by it. 
Vanderbilt threw his fortune in the balance and cornered the market in Harlem stock. The councilmen, unable to find shares to cover their short sales, pleaded for mercy. He fixed a stiff price to let them off, and they thought better of betraying him again. In 1864, however, the state legislature attempted the same maneuver. Vanderbilt conducted another corner, on an even larger scale, and stripped Albany naked as he punished the corrupt senators and assemblymen. 
Wall Street had known corners before, but the size, speed, and skill of the Commodore's operations caught the public imagination. They marked the emergence of Wall Street as an iconic place in American culture, infused with both romance and dread. With the meltdown of 2008, the public's attitude switched from love to hate overnight, but that relationship, with all its ups and downs, began in Vanderbilt's day. 
It was the railroads that lifted Wall Street to prominence, for they were far larger than any other business in America. The biggest New York banks were capitalized at about $1 million each, compared to about $6 million for the Harlem (not a particularly large line). And yet, railroads were not large enough. 
Vanderbilt, it appears, had no plan for amassing the empire he eventually built. At the age of 70, he was about a decade younger than Mr. Buffett is today, yet well past life expectancy, and the Harlem seemed almost a hobby. But he was plagued by the railroad net's fragmentation. Short lines built for local needs now linked up in a continental system with 30,000 miles of track. A trip between Chicago and New York passed through numerous companies, each with its own schedules, rolling stock, and procedures. The inefficiency was bad enough, but connecting lines often clashed, with potentially dire consequences. 
After acquiring the Hudson River Railroad in 1864, Vanderbilt controlled the only lines that entered Manhattan. But he depended on the New York Central, which ran from Albany to Buffalo, for a connection with the West. The Central infuriated him by transferring passengers and freight to steamboats on the Hudson River during all but the winter months. Still, he spent three years patiently negotiating, and finally reached an agreement. Then, in December 1866, Henry Keep, an old enemy of Vanderbilt's, took over the Central and revoked it. 
Vanderbilt retaliated by closing his lines to the Central's traffic. It was January 1867. The Hudson was frozen, and no boats could reach Albany. Shut out of New York, his foes capitulated. Central shares fell on the exchange, and Vanderbilt bought control. 
Vanderbilt brought order to this chaotic industry by consolidating his core companies into the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad, and by purchasing still more lines. With his son William as operational manager, he wrung new efficiency and profits from his railways, making transportation cheaper and himself richer. He constructed new infrastructure, such as the original Grand Central, that strengthened his competitive advantages and reshaped New York. 
But controversy dogged him. His battles with Jay Gould, a railroad executive and stock-market operator, became notorious. 
Gould was exactly 42 years younger than Vanderbilt, and his opposite in everything but cunning. A small man with a great black beard, he publicly embarrassed the Commodore more than once. Infuriated by one of his maneuvers, Vanderbilt told a reporter, 'You have my authority for stating that I consider Mr. Jay Gould a damned villain.' 
The Erie War of 1868, their epic fight over Erie Railway stock, was considered an emblem of the dangers of ruthlessness and gigantism in business. The modern argument in favor of government regulation began to emerge, centered on the Commodore. 
Mr. Buffett's approach to investment often seems to parallel the Commodore's. Vanderbilt accepted no salary as an executive, but took only the dividends on his personal stock. (In his era, investors expected steady dividends, not rising share prices.) To prosper, he had to make his corporations profitable, year after year. He bought lines with permanent advantages -- those that ran through developed regions that provided local traffic, for example, and that had low grades, which reduced operating expenses. So, too, does Mr. Buffett look to the long term. As he explained his purchase of Burlington Northern, "I just basically believe this country will prosper, and you'll have more people moving more goods 10 and 20 and 30 years from now, and the rails should benefit." 
But the differences are more interesting. Mr. Buffett is betting on good old fashioned stuff -- such as grain, coal for power plants and consumer goods imported from Asia -- and the need to move it. Vanderbilt did the same, of course, but he also helped to create the world of finance. Many of the abstractions we take for granted today -- corporations, securities, financial markets and more -- emerged in modern form in the Commodore's time, amid fierce controversy. His career was an act of imagination, based on an understanding of the intangible devices of capitalism that many of his contemporaries lacked. Vanderbilt was attacked, for example, for splitting New York Central stock. Critics saw the new shares as fraud, believing that each one had to represent $100 of investment in physical capital. But Vanderbilt always grasped the power -- and dangers -- of markets and corporations better than anyone. 
The contrast between his time and ours highlights a weakness in Mr. Buffett's investment. By 1870, rail dominated transportation, carrying virtually everything (and everyone). By contrast, Burlington Northern faces competition from modes of transportation unheard-of in the 19th century -- though it benefits from prior consolidation in the industry. 
The Commodore also smoothed the way for his would-be successor. In Vanderbilt's day, nothing approached the size and importance of the railroads -- not mining, energy, or even manufacturing. But the efficiency and wealth produced by his lines fostered a far larger and more complex economy. We are no longer hostage to the fortunes of just one industry, at least not to the extent we were in 1873, when the railroad bubble popped and started a depression. There is a final irony here. Mr. Buffett could never match Vanderbilt's power and fortune because of the economy's diversity. Yet that same diversity should help it bounce back, and boost Burlington Northern. 
The railroad has been iconic since its inception. It represents the quintessentially American urge to conquer space and time. Still, I doubt we would want another Commodore today. He was uniquely matched to his tumultuous times, as America spread across the continent, fought a Civil War and erected a corporate economy. Personally violent, ruthless, brilliant, proud, honest and competitive to the core, he was just the man to battle to the top of our first great industry. Times have changed, and railroads are now among our oldest industries. The quieter Sage of Omaha might be the right man to make us proud of it again.

Divisions among Democrats were on display Thursday in a Senate committee vote approving a climate-change bill. 
Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) voted against his own party's climate-change bill, calling for a scaled-back measure that might win more bipartisan support. Mr. Baucus, a key player in the health-care overhaul debate, said the measure set too ambitious a target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020, and hadn't done enough to protect farmers. 
Republicans boycotted the 11-1 vote in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. They said more study needed to be done on the potential harm to the economy from the measure's cap on emissions, and its requirement that businesses buy permits, which could be traded, to emit carbon dioxide and other gases. 
The tensions among Democrats point to the wider debate within the party about how aggressively to push the leading issues on President Barack Obama's agenda after Tuesday's election setbacks. Moderates worry about moving too fast for voters, while liberals say swift action on issues like climate and health care will remotivate the party's base. 
One of the climate bill's co-sponsors, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), signaled Thursday he was well aware of the political challenges facing his more conservative colleagues. Mr. Kerry has launched discussions with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Connecticut independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman to fashion a compromise measure. 
Senate Democrats considered vulnerable in the 2010 election include Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and moderates Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
Doubts about cap-and-trade played a role in swinging some previously Democratic coal-mining areas of southwestern Virginia toward Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell, the winner Tuesday. He attacked his Democratic opponent, R. Creigh Deeds, as a supporter of Mr. Obama's cap-and-trade plans. Mr. Deeds argued he would oppose any tax increases related to energy, but lost by a 2-to-1 margin in coal country.

Abstract 
[...] most, if not all, complex systems -- such as the economy, the stock market and the climate -- can't be predicted with any useful precision. 

Full Text 
Your excellent article "The Earth Cools, and Fight Over Warming Heats Up" (Currents, Oct. 30) wittingly or unwittingly unveils the truth about global warming: Nobody knows and nobody can know what the climate will be like five minutes from now, much less in 100 years. While it doesn't directly say so, the article demonstrates that all attempts to understand and predict the climate are, and always will be, hopeless, and all climate models are worthless. 
Models, by definition, use a reduced data set and a number of simplifying assumptions to approximate the behavior of the system being modeled. Because of that, most, if not 
all, complex systems -- such as the economy, the stock market and the climate -- can't be predicted with any useful precision. 
With these facts in mind, one can only conclude that it is insane to base political "solutions" on the predictions made using climate models.

The purpose of the meeting in Copenhagen isn't to try to hash out an agreement to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Every physicist in America knows or should know that alternative renewable biofuel will emit more carbon dioxide than gasoline. The purpose of the Copenhagen meeting is to try to make oil and coal extinct in order to benefit certain special-interest groups. 
Models are chock full of assumptions. As Angelo Donghia so wisely said, "Assumption is the mother of the screw up." The Copenhagen crowd has thrown the scientific method 
under the bus.

Abstract 
For centuries, the Chinese have raised special breeds of dogs, like the black-tongued chow, for chow, and many European countries still have laws on the books regarding postmortem examination of dogs intended for human consumption. Rendering -- the conversion of animal protein unfit for human consumption into food for livestock and pets ­
- allows processing plants to transform useless dead dogs into productive members of the food chain. 

Full Text 
Despite the fact that it's perfectly legal in 44 states, eating "man's best friend" is as taboo as a man eating his best friend. Even the most enthusiastic carnivores won't eat dogs. TV guy and sometimes cooker Gordon Ramsay can get pretty macho with lambs and piglets when doing publicity for something he's selling, but you'll never see a puppy peeking out of one of his pots. And though he once said he'd electrocute his children if they became vegetarian, one can't help but wonder what his response would be if they poached the family pooch. 
Dogs are wonderful, and in many ways unique. But they are remarkably unremarkable in their intellectual and experiential capacities. Pigs are every bit as intelligent and feeling, by any sensible definition of the words. They can't hop into the back of a Volvo, but they can fetch, run and play, be mischievous and reciprocate affection. So why don't they get to curl up by the fire? Why can't they at least be spared being tossed on the fire? Our taboo against dog eating says something about dogs and a great deal about us. 
The French, who love their dogs, sometimes eat their horses. 
The Spanish, who love their horses, sometimes eat their cows. 
The Indians, who love their cows, sometimes eat their dogs. 
While written in a much different context, George Orwell's words (from "Animal Farm") apply here: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." 
So who's right? What might be the reasons to exclude canine from the menu? The selective carnivore suggests: 
Don't eat companion animals. But dogs aren't kept as companions in all of the places they are eaten. And what about our petless neighbors? Would we have any right to object if they had dog for dinner? 
OK, then: Don't eat animals with significant mental capacities. If by "significant mental capacities" we mean what a dog has, then good for the dog. But such a definition would also include the pig, cow and chicken. And it would exclude severely impaired humans. 
Then: It's for good reason that the eternal taboos -- don't fiddle with your crap, kiss your sister, or eat your companions -- are taboo. Evolutionarily speaking, those things are bad for us. But dog eating isn't a taboo in many places, and it isn't in any way bad for us. Properly cooked, dog meat poses no greater health risks than any other meat. 
Dog meat has been described as "gamey" "complex," "buttery" and "floral." And there is a proud pedigree of eating it. Fourth-century tombs contain depictions of dogs being slaughtered along with other food animals. It was a fundamental enough habit to have informed language itself: the Sino-Korean character for "fair and proper" (yeon) literally translates into "as cooked dog meat is delicious." Hippocrates praised dog meat as a source of strength. Dakota Indians enjoyed dog liver, and not so long ago Hawaiians ate dog brains and blood. Captain Cook ate dog. Roald Amundsen famously ate his sled dogs. (Granted, he was really hungry.) And dogs are still eaten to overcome bad luck in the Philippines; as medicine in China and Korea; to enhance libido in Nigeria and in numerous places, on every continent, because they taste good. For centuries, the Chinese have raised special breeds of dogs, like the black-tongued chow, for chow, and many European countries still have laws on the books regarding postmortem examination of dogs intended for human consumption. 
Of course, something having been done just about everywhere is no kind of justification for doing it now. But unlike all farmed meat, which requires the creation and maintenance of animals, dogs are practically begging to be eaten. Three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized annually. The simple disposal of these euthanized dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem. But eating those strays, those runaways, those not-quite-cute-enough-to-take and not-quite-well-behaved-enough-to-keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it, too. 
In a sense it's what we're doing already. Rendering -- the conversion of animal protein unfit for human consumption into food for livestock and pets -- allows processing plants to transform useless dead dogs into productive members of the food chain. In America, millions of dogs and cats euthanized in animal shelters every year become the food for our food. So let's just eliminate this inefficient and bizarre middle step. 
This need not challenge our civility. We won't make them suffer any more than necessary. While it's widely believed that adrenaline makes dog meat taste better -- hence the traditional methods of slaughter: hanging, boiling alive, beating to death -- we can all agree that if we're going to eat them, we should kill them quickly and painlessly, right? For example, the traditional Hawaiian means of holding the dog's nose shut -- in order to conserve blood -- must be regarded (socially if not legally) as a no-no. Perhaps we could include dogs under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. That doesn't say anything about how they're treated during their lives, and isn't subject to any meaningful oversight or enforcement, but surely we can rely on the industry to "self-regulate," as we do with other eaten animals. 
Few people sufficiently appreciate the colossal task of feeding a world of billions of omnivores who demand meat with their potatoes. The inefficient use of dogs -- conveniently already in areas of high human population (take note, local-food advocates) -- should make any good ecologist blush. One could argue that various "humane" groups are the worst hypocrites, spending enormous amounts of money and energy in a futile attempt to reduce the number of unwanted dogs while at the very same time propagating the irresponsible no-dog-for-dinner taboo. If we let dogs be dogs, and breed without interference, we would create a sustainable, local meat supply with low energy inputs that would put even the most efficient grass-based farming to shame. For the ecologically-minded it's time to admit that dog is realistic food for realistic environmentalists. 
For those already convinced, here's a classic Filipino recipe I recently came across. I haven't tried it myself, but sometimes you can read a recipe and just know. 
STEWED DOG, WEDDING STYLE 
First, kill a medium-sized dog, then burn off the fur over a hot fire. Carefully remove the skin while still warm and set aside for later (may be used in other recipes). Cut meat into 1" cubes. Marinate meat in mixture of vinegar, peppercorn, salt, and garlic for 2 hours. Fry meat in oil using a large wok over an open fire, then add onions and chopped pineapple and saute until tender. Pour in tomato sauce and boiling water, add green pepper, bay leaf, and Tabasco. Cover and simmer over warm coals until meat is tender. Blend in puree of dog's liver and cook for additional 5-7 minutes. 
There is an overabundance of rational reasons to say no to factory-farmed meat: It is the No. 1 cause of global warming, it systematically forces tens of billions of animals to suffer in ways that would be illegal if they were dogs, it is a decisive factor in the development of swine and avian flus, and so on. And yet even most people who know these things still aren't inspired to order something else on the menu. Why? 
Food is not rational. Food is culture, habit, craving and identity. Responding to factory farming calls for a capacity to care that dwells beyond information. We know what we see on undercover videos of factory farms and slaughterhouses is wrong. (There are those who will defend a system that allows for occasional animal cruelty, but no one defends the cruelty, itself.) And despite it being entirely reasonable, the case for eating dogs is likely repulsive to just about every reader of this paper. The instinct comes before our reason, and is more important. 
Jonathan Safran Foer is the author of the novels "Everything is Illuminated" and "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close." His new book, "Eating Animals," a work of nonfiction, comes out next week.

WASHINGTON -- With President Barack Obama bidding to overhaul the health-care system, tighten bank oversight and make industries pay for their emissions, some trade-association chiefs have decided to compromise with the party in power. 
Not Thomas Donohue. On many of Mr. Obama's priorities, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is working to defeat the administration -- delighting some members, causing some to quit and sparking a furious reaction from the White House and left-wing activists. In the process, he has made the Chamber one of Mr. Obama's most visible opponents. 
On climate change, Mr. Donohue's group says warmer temperatures could help by reducing deaths related to cold weather. 
On health care, a Chamber ad says Mr. Obama's approach will kill jobs and slow growth. 
On financial regulation, one ad says the administration's plan will hurt small businesses, "even the small butcher" -- a line that prompted Mr. Obama to denounce the Chamber from the presidential podium this month. 
Now, Mr. Donohue aims to spend $20 million annually for several years advocating free-market policies such as open trade and less regulation, taking aim at much of the Democrats' agenda. The public-relations campaign is the biggest undertaking in the Chamber's 100-year history. 
A question hanging over all this is whether Mr. Donohue's aggressive stance will work better than compromise. The Chamber, which says it has 300,000 dues-paying members, has become a political target in Washington's partisan atmosphere. Though Mr. Donohue has strong supporters, a vocal minority of companies, including Apple Inc. and Nike Inc., have recently quit the Chamber or its board. 
"They've put Main Street businesses in a precarious place by taking a position that's not credible and doesn't allow them to shape legislation to their members' benefit," says James Rogers, chief executive of electric utility Duke Energy Corp. 
Mr. Rogers said he has cut Duke's contributions to the Chamber over two years to protest its "over the top" stance on climate change. Duke is one of the biggest owners of nuclear reactors in the U.S. but also the country's third biggest emitter of carbon dioxide because of its reliance on coal. It has said it favors legislation putting a price on carbon partly out of a desire for regulatory certainty in making investment decisions. 
Through a spokesman, Mr. Donohue declined to be interviewed for this article. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations this month, the 71­year-old executive said "the great preponderance of our members believe in our position [on climate change] and support it." 
On the Chamber's general approach, he said: "We work very hard to be inclusive, to give people a fair hearing, to ask for their input, and go back and forth with them." In a response to written questions, Mr. Donohue said Duke's Mr. Rogers "remains a good strong member whose counsel we greatly value." 
Though it has attacked the leading proposals in Congress to make companies pay for their greenhouse-gas emissions, the Chamber accepts the idea that man-made emissions contribute to climate change and supports reducing them. 
Some supporters of Mr. Donohue say if anything, he has been too accommodating to companies that support Congress's climate-change legislation. "You can never herd all companies in the same direction. He's doing as good a job as anyone I've seen heading one of these organizations," said Don Blankenship, CEO of coal producer Massey Energy Co., and a Chamber board member. 
But, Mr. Blankenship added, "I don't like to see trade associations refer to global warming as 'an issue' because it supports the idea something needs to be done about it." He said he has pressed Mr. Donohue to take an even tougher stand against proposals in Congress to require companies to pay for their emissions. He said high emissions "mean you've got a better, more productive economy." 
Some other trade associations have moved to compromise with Democrats. Drug makers have offered $80 billion in savings to help fund a health-care overhaul. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers not only endorsed the administration's plan to raise national fuel-economy standards but helped it thwart a proposal by Senate Republicans to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate emissions. 
The Chamber is in the unusual position of quarreling publicly with major corporations. In recent weeks, Apple, PG&E Corp., PNM Resources Inc. and Exelon Corp. have quit the association, citing its position on climate change, while Nike quit its board. Exelon, a major generator of nuclear energy, says it expects an annual revenue boost of about $1.1 billion if climate legislation approved by the House in June is enacted. 
Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently called the resignations "wonderful." In response, the senior Republican on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, said it was "disingenuous" for Nike and Apple to criticize the Chamber "while manufacturing their products in countries that consistently refuse mandatory emission impacts." Representatives of both companies declined to comment. 
With environmentalists and activist shareholders pressuring some firms to quit the Chamber, it sent members a memo two weeks ago apologizing for "any annoyance and inconvenience these efforts against us might cause you." 
The Chamber recently disclosed it spent $34.7 million to lobby the government in the third quarter. That was up 68% from the same period last year. 
A former Postal Service executive and trucking lobbyist, Mr. Donohue has tripled the Chamber's revenue over 12 years, helped beat back tougher air-quality rules and helped pass legislation that makes it harder to bring class-action lawsuits. The Chamber's board has rewarded him with a chauffeured car, $3.1 million in annual pay and the use of corporate aircraft often stocked with oatmeal-raisin cookies, his favorite snack. 
Shortly after taking over in 1997, he pledged to dispel what he said was the Chamber's image as "a sleeping giant, missing in action from many important battles." He publicly expressed hope someone would punch the then-president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, "in the mouth." 
To bolster firepower, Mr. Donohue hired a new team, including William L. Kovacs as senior vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs. The Chamber then launched a series of attacks on climate-related legislative bills. 
Democrats in Congress would like to bring down emissions by requiring companies to have permits to emit the gases. Over time, the U.S. would issue fewer permits, with the aim of reducing emissions. 
In December 2007, the Chamber produced a TV and Internet ad depicting a family wearing coats indoors, cooking over candles and walking to work. Legislation in the Senate "could make it more expensive to heat our homes, power our lives and drive our cars," it said. "Is this really how Americans want to live?" 
The ads surprised officials at the U.S. unit of Germany's Siemens AG, which could see more demand for its wind-power and nuclear-services businesses if the U.S. adopts carbon caps. "We told [Mr. Donohue] we didn't agree with the ads and that we'd like a heads-up when a decision is made on how to represent the Chamber's position on climate change," a Siemens spokeswoman said at the time. 
The ads also got the attention of Gen. James L. Jones, a retired Marine Corps commandant and then president of the Institute for 21st Century Energy, a unit of the Chamber that makes recommendations to policy makers. According to a person familiar with the matter, Gen. Jones complained to Mr. Donohue that the ads put him in an awkward spot because the general was seeking a United Nations foundation's support for Chamber energy initiatives. 
Two months later, the Chamber released another Internet video, on the eve of a U.N. climate conference in Monaco, accusing U.N. diplomats of hypocrisy for staging summits in locations requiring jet travel. 
"Jones's concern was that it would make the Chamber look like bullies," said the person familiar with the matter. 
Gen. Jones, now Mr. Obama's national security adviser, didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Donohue, through a spokesman, declined to comment on his discussions with Gen. Jones except to say the two "have had literally thousands of conversations over a full range of topics." He said the general is a "great friend" and was "an absolutely superb president of our Institute for 21st Century Energy." 
Some Chamber members who support tougher regulation see it as just one of many important issues and praise other positions taken by the group. George Nolen, a retired CEO of Siemens's U.S. unit, cites the Chamber's support of free-trade policies. "They can't possibly have every member company in agreement on how to attack the problem in the same way," he says. 
But as a House panel prepared for hearings on emissions restrictions in April, Johnson & Johnson's vice president for government affairs, Clifford Holland, urged the Chamber to express its members'"full range of views" on the issue. He expressed hope "a consensus can be reached that reflects the views of the range of Chamber members." 
The next week, officials from dozens of corporations gathered at Chamber headquarters to hear presentations from the rival camps. A Dow Chemical Co. representative called for a gradually tightening cap on emissions. An Exxon Mobil Corp. executive argued that a carbon tax was more efficient. 
Fred Palmer, a senior vice president of coal producer Peabody Energy Corp., which has a seat on the Chamber board, advocated holding off on restricting emissions. The government should instead increase spending on emissions-reducing technology, he said. 
According to three people who attended, Mr. Palmer said God wanted the U.S. to use its coal reserves. Through a spokesman, Mr. Palmer said he didn't refer to God but said that "Nature has blessed us with an abundant low-cost energy resource that helps the world live far better than it would otherwise." 
Until this past summer, the Chamber's uneasy balance on climate change was holding. Then in June, the group petitioned the EPA to hold a hearing on the agency's declaration that greenhouse gases endanger public health -- the basis for regulating them under the Clean Air Act. 
The Chamber accused the EPA of ignoring analyses that "show that a warming of even 3 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years would, on balance, be beneficial to humans" because the reduction of wintertime deaths would be "several times larger than the increase in summertime heat stress-related" deaths. 
In interviews with reporters, Mr. Kovacs, the Chamber's environment chief, spoke of its desire for a hearing that would be the "Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century," referring to the 1925 trial that pitted evolutionism against creationism. 
Environmentalists and some Chamber members pounced. In a letter to Mr. Donohue dated Sept. 18, PG&E CEO Peter Darbee said his company would leave the Chamber as a result of "deep concern" over "extreme rhetoric and obstructionist tactics." 
Mr. Donohue has suggested some of the recent resignations were orchestrated to embarrass the Chamber. Calling global warming "an issue the world has to deal with," he expressed regret to reporters this month about Mr. Kovacs's invocation of the Scopes trial. 
Mr. Donohue didn't back down from the EPA petition, which he said is intended to force the agency to answer "the fundamental question of how are you going about this, what are the issues you're considering, and where are you going?" 
Mr. Donohue said the Chamber continues to support federal investments and incentives for power that can be produced without emitting carbon dioxide, while "standing firm" in its opposition to the legislation passed by the House. "If people want to attack us, bring 'em on," Mr. Donohue told reporters. 
They are. Last week, a group claiming to represent the Chamber staged a phony press conference in Washington to announce the Chamber would suspend all lobbying against climate legislation. A real Chamber spokesman interrupted the fake announcement, but not before several news organizations reported it. 
The Chamber called the hoax "a foolish distraction from the serious effort by our nation to reduce greenhouse gases." This week, it sued the group that organized the stunt, alleging in federal court that it had violated trademark law by using the Chamber's emblem.

Abstract

Donning FDR's cape, Eisenhower's stripes and JFK's boat shoes, President Obama observed in Florida on Tuesday that his "clean energy economy" will require "mobilization" on the order of fighting World War II, building the interstate highway system and going to the moon. Of course, the only "mobilization" going on at the moment is on behalf of ethanol, whose many political dispensations the biofuels lobby is finding new ways to preserve even as the evidence of its destructiveness piles up. 
The latest embarrassment arrives via the peer-reviewed journal Science, not known for its right-wing inclinations. A new paper calls attention to what the authors (led by Princeton's Tim Searchinger) call "a critical accounting error" in the way carbon emissions from biofuels are measured in climate-change programs world-wide. Bernie Madoff had a few critical accounting errors too. 
Though you won't hear it from the biofuels lobby, ethanol actually generates the same amount of greenhouse gas as fossil fuels, or more, per unit of energy. But this was still supposed to be better than coal or oil because ethanol's CO2 is "recycled." Since plants absorb and store carbon that is already in the atmosphere, burning them as fuel would create no new emissions, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that has been buried for millions of years. 
With everything supposedly balancing out, the cap-and-trade programs run by the United Nations and European Union -- and maybe soon the U.S. -- treat biofuels as carbon-neutral. The Science study argues that this is a false economy, because it doesn't consider changes in land use. If mature forests are cleared to make room for biofuel-growing farms, then the carbon that would otherwise accumulate in those forests ought to be counted on ethanol's balance sheet as well. 
Cap-and-trade programs exacerbate the problem because developed countries (where emissions are putatively capped) get credit for reductions from ethanol -- despite the fact that their biofuels are generally grown in developing countries (where emissions aren't capped). So if Malaysians burn down a rain forest to grow palm oil that ends up in German biodiesel, Malaysia doesn't count the land-use emissions and Germany doesn't count the tail-pipe emissions. 
Given these incentives, the authors cite a study showing that by 2050, "based solely on economic considerations, bioenergy could displace 59% of the world's natural forest cover. . . . The reason: When bioenergy from any biomass is counted as carbon neutral, economics favor large-scale land conversion for bioenergy regardless of the actual net emissions." In other words, not only is cap and trade self-defeating on its own terms but it also risks creating a genuine ecological disaster. 
By way of a solution, Mr. Searchinger and his coauthors modestly suggest doing away with the regulatory three-card monte and counting net ethanol emissions from where they are actually emitted. But this is political heresy on Rep. Henry Waxman's Energy and Commerce Committee, which passed its own cap-and-tax program in July with the votes of farm-state Democrats, because the bill all but banned the Environmental Protection Agency from studying land-use changes. So much for letting "the science" guide public policy. 
In Florida, Mr. Obama said the only people who could oppose his climate plan are "those who are afraid of the future." On this one, at least, the President is right.

Abstract 
The Senate bill, like the House measure, would require companies across the economy to hold government-issued permits to emit greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide -- which scientists have linked to a long-term rise in global temperatures. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Max Baucus said Tuesday he has "serious reservations" about climate legislation unveiled by his Democratic colleagues, signaling trouble for a proposal that is stronger in certain respects than a bill passed by the House. 
Mr. Baucus made his comments at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which took up climate legislation written by Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.). The bill calls for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020. That is tougher than a House-passed version, which calls for a reduction of 17%. 
The Senate bill also protects the authority of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions using the Clean Air Act, powers that were stripped by the House. 
Mr. Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, will be a key player in shaping any final bill, as that panel also has jurisdiction over some elements of climate legislation. His views are closer to those of other Democrats from heartland and coal-dependent states whose support will be essential to passing a climate bill. 
"I have some concerns about the overall direction of the bill," Mr. Baucus said at the start of hearings Tuesday. "I have serious reservations with the depth of the midterm reduction target . . . and the lack of pre-emption of the Clean Air Act." 
As proposed, the bill risks moving legislators "further away from that achievable consensus on common-sense climate-change [legislation]," Mr. Baucus said. 
Ms. Boxer said Mr. Baucus might adjust his position when she explains that the 20% target is easier to achieve since U.S. greenhouse-gas levels have fallen in recent years. "We're going to be talking with him about that," she said. 
Other Democratic members of the committee also hinted they would like to see a more moderate bill. Sen. Arlen Specter (D., Pa.) expressed concern that emission-intense industries such as oil refining or coal-production might be hurt. Pennsylvania industry relies heavily on coal-generated power. 
Supporters of the climate proposal can ill afford to lose any Democratic votes in the Senate, given stiff Republican opposition. GOP panel members have said they will try to keep the bill from passing out of committee if there isn't a comprehensive review of costs by the EPA and the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans say the Kerry-Boxer bill as drafted could hurt the economy. 
Several cabinet officials appeared at the hearing to encourage passage of a bill to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. The Senate bill, like the House measure, would require companies across the economy to hold government-issued permits to emit greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide -- which scientists have linked to a long-term rise in global temperatures. 
Like the House measure, the Senate bill aims to ease costs to industry by initially giving away for free permits to certain industries, such as electric utilities and makers of steel and cement. Over time, the government would reduce the number of permits issued, bringing down emissions, while letting companies trade the valuable permits among themselves.

World News: German Nuclear Plants Get a New Lease --- After Election, Alliance Agrees to Extend the Use of Atomic Energy, Rekindling a Long, Emotional Debate

Abstract 
Because the plants are relatively old and their costs have largely depreciated, they are a cost-efficient way to produce energy. Sweden, the first European country to say no to nuclear power in 1980 and a leader in alternative-energy development, halted its nuclear phase-out plans this year for fear it would have to turn to energy sources that produce large quantities of greenhouse gases. 

Full Text 
BERLIN -- The victory of Chancellor Angela Merkel's new alliance in elections last month promises to extend the country's use of nuclear power -- and reignite protests among those who have fought to phase it out. 
Both Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and their new governing partners, the business-friendly Free Democrats, want to scrap a law that says all 17 of the country's nuclear plants must be shut down by 2022. In alliance negotiations this week, the parties struck a preliminary agreement to allow the reactors to run longer, at least until renewable-energy sources can fill the gap. 
Germany's opposition parties have promised to fight any policy change. Hundreds of antinuclear activists have been protesting outside the Berlin offices where conservatives and Free Democrats have been negotiating to form a new coalition government. 
"If it comes to that, you can count on it re-energizing the antinuclear movement here," warned Mathias Edler, nuclear-power expert for Greenpeace Germany. 
Decades of widespread anti-nuclear sentiment culminated in the 2002 legislation to phase out atomic energy. But the reactors still supply nearly a quarter of the country's electricity. To keep the power on without them, Germany might have to burn more coal and miss its goals to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions -- or become more reliant on its largest natural-gas supplier, Russia. 
So far, though, the trickiest disputes have surfaced within the pro-nuclear power camp. One thorny issue is who would profit. Because the plants are relatively old and their costs have largely depreciated, they are a cost-efficient way to produce energy. Extending their lives could add more than 1 million euros ($1.5 million) a day in profits per plant, German think tank DIW estimates. 
Germany's four major utilities -- E.On AG, RWE AG, Energie Baden-Wurttemberg AG and Vattenfall Europe AG -- stand to reap tens of billions of euros in unanticipated profit if they gain up to 10 more years to run the plants. 
Leery of being seen as changing policy in order to abet a corporate windfall, both parties say they would redirect much of these profits to a renewable-energy development fund. Negotiators hammering out the details of the policy proposal also say it isn't clear how many of the 17 reactors will be able to stay in operation longer since they will have to meet new and potentially costly safety conditions to keep them running. 
RWE, which has one reactor expected to expire next year and another by 2013, has said it is willing to negotiate to enable an extension. In a television interview with German national broadcaster ARD after the elections, its chief executive, Jurgen Grossmann, said the utility would contribute "a big double-digit percentage" of extra profits to a fund. 
But E.On, which stands to lose far less of its nuclear capacity over the next four years and increasingly generates more of its profits outside Germany, has refrained from saying where it stands on the idea. EnBW and Vattenfall also declined to comment. 
Germany has long been the heart of the antinuclear movement in Europe. The 2002 legislation to shutter the country's plants culminated decades of widespread antinuclear sentiment. This year, the issue was one of the few fiery points of debate in an otherwise tepid national elections, after a short-circuit in a transformer caused a Vattenfall­operated reactor to shut down in July. In an April poll by the Forsa Institute, conducted on behalf of the outgoing government's environment ministry, 66% of those surveyed wanted to continue with the planned phase-out or accelerate it. 
Yet rising electricity prices and growing concern about climate change have tempered the opposition, particularly among younger Germans: In the Forsa poll, less than 50% of those under 30 years old said they were concerned about the safety of nuclear energy. 
The country also increasingly stands alone on the antinuclear front in Europe. Sweden, the first European country to say no to nuclear power in 1980 and a leader in alternative-energy development, halted its nuclear phase-out plans this year for fear it would have to turn to energy sources that produce large quantities of greenhouse gases. 
Extending the life of Germany's nuclear plants would buy the country only a decade or so before it would have to fill the gap with other sources, as plants become too old to operate. Skeptics argue an extension would take pressure off the big utilities, which have just begun investing big sums into alternative energy. 
Lutz Mez, an energy-policy expert at Berlin's Free University, says keeping nuclear power would perpetuate barriers of entry for would-be competitors. "Those who want more competition and lower prices in electricity should think about that," he said. 
How many of the reactors will continue operating, and for how much longer, won't be clear until later negotiations with the utilities over the details, a Christian Democrat spokesman said. 
That is likely to suit Ms. Merkel, who has been pushing to put off any detailed nuclear policy shift that could rattle some voters until after regional elections in May in North Rhine-Westphalia. Her conservative coalition would lose its majority in the upper house of parliament if it doesn't retain power in the state.

Abstract 
"The best that can be said is that they are a nuisance," said David Conover, who was principal deputy assistant secretary for policy and international affairs at the department during the administration of President George W. Bush. 

Full Text 
Energy Secretary Steven Chu set out this year to address America's energy future with a network of new research labs. But lawmakers drafted their own blueprint: Instead of fully funding Dr. Chu's request, an energy-spending bill sets aside millions of dollars for such projects as an aviation-research institute, an environmentally friendly locomotive and air conditioning for a New Jersey museum. 
When President Barack Obama signed a spending bill for the 2009 fiscal year in March, he said he wanted earmark-laden legislation to be an "end to the old way of doing 
business, and the beginning of a new era of responsibility and accountability." 
Congress, however, hasn't given up earmarks -- the term for seemingly parochial projects funded at the behest of lawmakers. 

The Obama administration didn't request these energy projects; it has proposed eliminating many of them. 
Critics of the proposals -- which total more than $400 million in the legislation nearing Senate approval -- say they threaten to distract the Energy Department at a time when it 
is trying to disburse roughly $37 billion that Congress approved earlier this year for fuel-efficient vehicles, a modernized electric grid and other projects. 

"The best that can be said is that they are a nuisance," said David Conover, who was principal deputy assistant secretary for policy and international affairs at the department 

during the administration of President George W. Bush. 
Overall, the legislation provides the department with $27.1 billion, $1.3 billion less than Mr. Obama and Dr. Chu sought. To achieve those savings, lawmakers slashed Dr. Chu's 
request to fund eight new research-and-development labs, at a cost of $280 million. The legislation would allow the department to fund three of the labs Dr. Chu wants, but 
largely with money from other parts of DOE's budget. 

Lawmakers say their proposals are consistent with the goals of U.S. energy policy. 

Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W. Va.), who championed a plan to spend $1.25 million on a study of coal liquefaction in China, has said it could help the U.S. "better pursue coal-to­liquids transportation fuels projects." Environmentalists say emissions associated with liquefied coal exacerbate climate change. 
Rep. Todd Tiahrt, (R., Kan.), says a provision to direct $1.5 million to the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University will allow small businesses to take 

advantage of research by the institute on composite materials often used in aircraft but that also could be used in products made by constituents. 

The proposal was one of several flagged in a recent "pork alert" by Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington nonprofit; the alert noted that the institute's Web site lists 
several large aerospace companies as clients. 
"We've got bright people at DOE, but they don't look at how we grow the economy," Mr. Tiahrt said. 
Similarly, a spokesman for Rep. Bill Shuster (R., Pa.) says the $1 million sought for a new electric locomotive to be developed by Pennsylvania State University is consistent with 

the government's interest in ensuring "a good, firm transportation infrastructure." 
The Energy Department proposed cutting off funding for the project. 
As for the $1.5 million for new air conditioning at the Newark Museum, Reps. Donald Payne (D., N.J.) and Rodney Frelinghuysen (R., N.J.) say the money would help the facility 

become a model of energy efficiency. Asked whether the museum could fund the project by raising admission fees, as Citizens Against Government Waste has suggested, Mr. 
Payne said the museum needs government money for such projects and to "continue making its collection accessible to the American public through affordable admission rates." 

Museum officials didn't respond to requests for comment. 
All told, the bill would provide $445 million for "congressionally directed projects" at DOE. That's a decline of 5.9% from the 2009 fiscal year, according to the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science. But factoring out defense-related portions of the agency's budget, earmarks at the department would total $421 million in fiscal 
2010, an 8.4% increase from 2009, the group says. 

"No one expects Congress to simply rubber stamp a budget with no changes," a DOE spokesman said. "We're pleased that members of both parties and both houses have 
worked quickly to produce a budget . . . that reflects our shared commitment to energy independence and creating the clean energy economy of the future." 
Mr. Obama is expected to sign the legislation.

So, West Virginia Sen. John D. Rockefeller is now concerned about the adverse impact the Senate climate bill will have on his coal-producing state ("EPA Proposes Tough Greenhouse-Gas Rules for Big Industries," U.S. News, Oct. 1). 
This is the same Sen. Rockefeller who, with Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe, sent a threatening letter in 2006 to Exxon Mobil Chairman Rex Tillerson because of that company's support for science-based opposition to the spurious claim that man-made greenhouse gas is causing global warming, a letter that provoked an editorial rebuke from the Journal ("Global Warming Gag Order," Review and Outlook, Dec. 4, 2006), and probably figured in Exxon-Mobil later being bullied into joining the costly and futile crusade to "combat climate change" by targeting the mere traces of greenhouse gas that remain in the atmosphere after a few hours.

Abstract 
CCS has never been tested on a commercial scale in a power plant, and experts at the International Energy Agency say installing the technology will require 1 billion euros ($1.46 billion) per project -- a sum that some environmentalists say would cost more than other forms of renewable energy. [...] with developing countries opening two new coal-fired power stations every week, much of the extra demand will be met by fossil fuels, despite the strong growth in nuclear power and renewable energy. 

Full Text 
Brandenburg, Germany -- Ulf Stumpe is scared of carbon dioxide -- but not the stuff blamed for global warming. What worries him is the CO2 a local energy firm wants to inject into the earth thousands of feet under his village. 
Mr. Stumpe is fighting plans by Vattenfall AB, the Swedish energy giant, to store millions of tons of the greenhouse gas in saline aquifers under the rolling fields of eastern Germany as part of an effort to reduce carbon emissions. 
Carbon capture and storage, or CCS, is seen by many governments and energy companies as a key weapon in the battle against climate change. They say it would allow mankind to continue burning coal while reducing emissions believed to be contributing to global warming. 
But as with other new technologies like wind power, local opposition can sometimes thwart global solutions. Germany is in the vanguard of CCS, but grass-roots protests are threatening to derail efforts to deploy the technology -- not just in Mr. Stumpe's Brandenburg home but across the country. 
Mr. Stumpe, a 28-year-old veterinarian, is "not a violent man," he says. "But there are people here who will do whatever it takes to stop this." 
If local backlashes don't slow adoption, high costs might. CCS has never been tested on a commercial scale in a power plant, and experts at the International Energy Agency say installing the technology will require 1 billion euros ($1.46 billion) per project -- a sum that some environmentalists say would cost more than other forms of renewable energy. 
"Today CCS is not economic," says Dr. John Barry, who leads Royal Dutch Shell PLC's carbon-capture effort. "We're at a high-cost phase where we need outside support to bridge the commercial gap." The hope is that as countries cap their emissions, the price of carbon will gradually rise to make CCS economically viable, he says, while technology costs fall. 
That, however, may be a long way off. Vattenfall acknowledges that at the current carbon price, the electricity produced in a CCS plant will be a third more expensive than from a normal station. 
CCS involves separating out the CO2 produced by power plants, oil refineries and cement factories and pumping it under pressure into porous rock thousands of feet under the Earth's surface where, the thinking goes, it will stay safely trapped. The basic building blocks have existed for decades. Oil companies have long been injecting CO2 into the ground to improve recovery ratios. Experiments with carbon capture and storage are under way elsewhere. Last Thursday, Ohio-based American Electric Power Corp. began pumping CO2 deep underground beside its Mountaineer coal-fired power plant in New Haven, W. Va. 
The logic behind deploying CCS more widely is simple. Global energy demand is expected to be 45% higher in 2030 than it is now, according to the IEA. And with developing countries opening two new coal-fired power stations every week, much of the extra demand will be met by fossil fuels, despite the strong growth in nuclear power and renewable energy. 
The European Union is now backing a rollout of carbon-capture technology. It wants to build between 10 and 12 CCS demonstration projects by 2015, and is offering about $1.5 billion from its economic-stimulus package and 300 million carbon credits from its emissions-trading system -- currently valued at about $8.8 billion. The Obama administration has also set aside $2.4 billion for CCS projects. 
Vattenfall has an incentive to be in the vanguard of clean coal. As regulation pushes up the price of carbon, the company's coal-fired power stations in Germany will become much more costly to run. Last year, it opened Europe's first CCS pilot plant at the power station Schwarze Pumpe. It is now planning a much bigger demonstration plant in Janschwalde, near Berlin. Vattenfall plans to pipe the CO2 sequestered there about 95 miles northward and deposit it deep below two small towns in the Brandenburg region, Neutrebbin and Beeskow. 
But Vattenfall can't bury the CO2 it sequesters at Schwarze Pumpe because authorities have so far failed to provide the necessary permits. So the gas is either sold for industrial cleaning or just vented into the atmosphere. 
Meanwhile, when Vattenfall in April unveiled its plan to store carbon in the Neutrebbin area, it triggered a storm of protest. Campaigners like Mr. Stumpe point to the sudden discharge of CO2 from Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 that suffocated more than 1,700 people. But that gas was naturally occurring and, thus far, there have been no known releases of stored CO2. 
Still, "people are worried about leaks," says Thomas Lautsch, Vattenfall Europe AG's head of CO2 storage. "They worry their kids will be suffocated, their cows will die, their property values will slump." 
To reassure them, Dr. Lautsch, a mining engineer, organized around six town-hall meetings to explain Vattenfall's plans. Germany has more than 40 natural-gas storage sites, many of them under residential areas, he said. If people could accept natural gas on their doorsteps, why not the less-dangerous CO2? 
Besides, he told villagers, the saline aquifers here were perfect for CO2 storage. They contain brine that is unfit for human consumption and are capped by solid layers of rock that are impermeable to liquids and gas. 
Many scientists back his arguments. They point to the experience of the Norwegian oil company StatoilHydro ASA, which for the last decade has been stripping CO2 out of the natural gas it produces at its Sleipner field in the North Sea and burying it deep underground. None of it has leaked. 
"Sleipner is a success story, and there's no reason why it shouldn't work in other places," says Mike Stephenson, head of science at the British Geological Survey. "The science we've done so far shows geological storage is a safe proposition." He added that CCS will typically use formations where oil and gas had been trapped for millions of years. 
But in Neutrebbin, Dr. Lautsch's attempts at reassurance met with resistance. Soon, locals were putting up posters in their windows with the words: "We are not guinea pigs!" A group of farmers said they won't let Vattenfall onto their property to conduct tests. 
The veterinarian Mr. Stumpe was one of the most active opponents, organizing meetings and getting petitions signed. He says he is worried by the absence of data to show how greenhouse gases will behave decades or centuries after they have been buried. 
Vattenfall isn't alone in encountering resistance. RWE AG, one of Germany's largest power producers, is facing opposition to its plans to pump carbon from a new power plant in the Ruhr industrial area to the north German region of Schleswig-Holstein. Vattenfall also had to postpone plans to deposit CO2 in northern Denmark after local farmers blocked access to their land. Its plans for Neutrebbin and Beeskow are also in limbo: The Brandenburg authorities have so far refused to allow the company to explore the area. 
Germany's government is also cooling on CCS. It passed a draft law creating a legal framework for carbon capture in April, but then shelved it until after national elections last month, as the anti-carbon campaigns intensified. 
Dr. Lautsch says he understands that gaining public acceptance will be an uphill struggle. "It will take a year of dialogue for people to accept what we do," he says.

Abstract 
Exelon, the nation's biggest nuclear-plant operator by output, says it sees an annual upside to its revenue of about $1.1 billion if climate legislation approved by the House in June is enacted. Because nuclear plants don't spew carbon dioxide, their operators wouldn't have to pay for the right to emit such gases, giving them an edge over competitors that burn fossil fuels. 

Full Text 
The flurry of companies quitting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is highlighting how the climate-change issue is straining traditional alliances in Washington, as some businesses seek to profit from overhauling the energy market and others try to cut deals to head off tougher regulation. 
Some companies and industry groups that have in the past worked with Republicans to fight efforts to curb the use of fossil fuels -- such as Detroit's auto makers -- are now expressing support for action on climate change. Some support legislation to put a price on the carbon-dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, while others support preserving the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate such greenhouse gases. 
The Chamber of Commerce says it supports efforts to fight climate change through federal investments and incentives for power that can be produced without emitting carbon dioxide. But the group has opposed proposals to require companies to pay for the right to emit carbon. 
The Chamber, which says it represents three million businesses, says its positions are "mainstream, common-sense views" approved by a majority of more than 100 business leaders who sit on its board of directors. 
Some companies -- such as Peabody Energy and ConocoPhillips -- have spoken out against climate legislation passed by the House of Representatives. Others -- such as General Electric Co. and Duke Energy Corp. -- have expressed support for it. 
Many companies backing action on climate change stand to gain if the U.S. requires corporations to pay for the right to emit carbon dioxide. 
In the past two weeks, three utilities -- Exelon Corp., PG&E Corp. and PNM Resources Inc. -- have quit the Chamber, citing the group's opposition to climate bills. A fourth company, Nike Inc., said Wednesday that it was resigning from the Chamber's board because the group "has not represented the diversity of perspective" held by the board's members on climate change. 
GE, which has built a marketing campaign around the clean-energy technology it sells, intends to remain a member despite differences with the Chamber on specific legislation, a spokesman says. 
Exelon, the nation's biggest nuclear-plant operator by output, says it sees an annual upside to its revenue of about $1.1 billion if climate legislation approved by the House in June is enacted. Because nuclear plants don't spew carbon dioxide, their operators wouldn't have to pay for the right to emit such gases, giving them an edge over competitors that burn fossil fuels. 
Exelon notes that it has spent billions of dollars over the years to reduce its carbon footprint, by investing in nuclear power, and that it decided years ago to sell most of its coal-powered plants. 
Last month, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers -- which includes General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. -- joined the Obama administration and environmentalists in opposing an effort to bar the EPA for one year from attempting to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions for power plants and other large sources. 
The group says it opposed the measure because it prefers a single, nationwide set of rules rather than a patchwork of regulations by states. It says it feared the one-year prohibition would have delayed the EPA from finalizing an agency proposal to regulate automobile greenhouse-gas emissions, potentially exposing its members to regulation by states. 
"It's not a big surprise that the auto industry, which was just bailed out by the administration, would come to their defense," says a spokesman for Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), who wrote the proposal. He notes that the measure said that "mobile" sources, such as cars, could still be regulated by the EPA. 
An alliance spokesman says that the group was "sympathetic to the thrust" of Ms. Murkowski's proposal but that eliminating the "inconsistency created by conflicting and overlapping" regulations at the state and federal level has been "the main priority of all auto makers" since 2002. 
Environmentalists have cheered the recent defections from the Chamber, hoping they might weaken one of the best-funded opponents of the climate legislation. 
The Chamber, in a statement after Exelon's resignation, said legislation capping U.S. emissions and passed by the House "is neither comprehensive nor international," and would spur retaliation from U.S. trading partners.

Abstract 
The overhang of newly developed gas resources at home, as well as expanding capacity to ship liquefied natural gas to the U.S. from overseas, could keep gas prices trading in a range of $4 to $7 per million British thermal units well into the next decade. [...] again, future growth opportunities are of questionable value in a sector struggling already with average net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of 4.1 times. [...] a new reality of moderate, calm gas prices carries significant risks to profitability. 

Full Text 
America's glut of natural gas weighs on prices and the prospects for drillers. But surely all that extra supply helps big customers like independent power producers? 
Reality is more nuanced. Electricity prices are set by the last generating plant to be switched on. In most U.S. markets, that generator burns natural gas. That makes the revenue of all merchant generators highly susceptible to gas prices. For those that actually burn gas, falling prices also reduce input costs, offering protection for margins. For those burning coal, margins are squeezed. 
The overhang of newly developed gas resources at home, as well as expanding capacity to ship liquefied natural gas to the U.S. from overseas, could keep gas prices trading in a range of $4 to $7 per million British thermal units well into the next decade. 
In one sense, that is good for all independent power producers. They were set up to expand as more states deregulated electricity markets. Stable prices could help open the door to further deregulation. 
Then again, future growth opportunities are of questionable value in a sector struggling already with average net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of 4.1 times. And a new reality of moderate, calm gas prices carries significant risks to profitability. 
The biggest risk is for coal-fired generators. Consider an unhedged plant burning coal in a market where an older gas-fired plant sets the electricity price. Assume gas costs $8 per million BTUs and coal $50 a ton. The gas-fired plant has to burn 10 million BTUs of gas to make one megawatt hour of electricity, giving total fuel costs of $80 per megawatt hour. If you add in some operating expenses and a return, then the price of electricity set by the marginal generator is about $90 per megawatt hour. 
The coal plant's costs, meanwhile, come to about $33, leaving a gross margin of more than $55 per megawatt hour. 
Now plug in a gas price of $5. Even if coal costs fall to $40 per ton, the coal plant's margin is cut almost in half. Then add in an eventual cost for carbon emissions. At $20 per ton, it lifts the electricity price overall. But because burning coal emits almost twice as much carbon dioxide as gas, the coal plant's implied margin is now about $20 per megawatt hour. 
There is an added complication. Industrial demand for electricity, 29% of the market, was down 12.5% from a year earlier in July, according to the Department of Energy. Andy DeVries of CreditSights points out that removing that amount of demand obviates the need to run older gas-fired plants, leaving more efficient power plants to set the market price instead. Based on the simple model described above, a power plant burning only seven million BTUs of $5 gas sets an electricity price of about $41 per megawatt hour. That cuts the coal-fired producer's margin to about $13. Factor in a carbon cost, and they make a loss. 
Gas-fired generators don't do so well either in such a weak market. But they do at least enjoy a hedge in the form of lower fuel and carbon costs. Of the independent power producers, Calpine stands out with efficient gas-fired plants accounting for more than four-fifths of its portfolio. Against that, its net debt to Ebitda is 5.3 times. Mirant, in contrast, carries less than one times Ebitda in net debt. But it has the oldest fleet of plants of any independent producer and relies heavily on coal. 
The independent producers are relatively new and their stocks tend to trade together. In their short lives, they have faced crises involving Enron and California, and several bankruptcies. With further dislocations stemming from the natural-gas market and climate-change proposals looming, investors need to be far more selective. 
Overheard 
The curse of Brian Roberts? Shares of Time Warner Cable dropped a total of 6.7% Thursday and Friday, as investor discontent with the decision by Comcast's CEO to go after NBC Universal spilled over on its fellow cable operator. While Comcast would undoubtedly disagree, some may interpret its interest in NBCU as a bearish signal for the cable-TV sector from the biggest operator. After all, just weeks ago an appeals court struck down rules that limited how much more cable Comcast could buy. Comcast has made clear since then that while it still likes cable, it would rather spend its money on content. 
That hurts Time Warner Cable in a couple of ways. Aside from the doubts it may cast on the sector's prospects, it suggests Comcast won't be bidding for Time Warner Cable anytime soon -- just in case anyone was hoping for such a deal. Still, deal making often comes with collateral damage.

Abstract 
Under the House's climate-change bill, a few utilities -- primarily those that have made big bets in renewable and nuclear energy -- are poised to clean up once Congress hands them carbon emission credits. Caught flat-footed by public outrage over health care, liberal interest groups are now attacking opponents of the Democratic agenda in personal terms. 

Full Text 
It isn't often an energy company (of all things) gets to present itself as an environmental crusader, cozy up to Washington rulemakers, buy political protection, and pad its bottom line -- all in one neat little announcement. So give Pacific Gas & Electric, PNM and Exelon credit for going for the gold. 
The three utility giants have made news recently by quitting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Their finer sensibilities, they explained, would no longer allow them to associate with an organization lacking in environmental fervor. How dare the Chamber demand the Environmental Protection Agency be transparent about the science it is relying on to regulate all carbon energy use. Heresy! "As a company with a clear and strong position on the importance of addressing climate change," we must go our own way, lamented PG&E's CEO Peter Darbee. 
Fortunately for Mr. Darbee, that way leads to the bank. As much as supporters of cap and tax would like to spin this as a new corporate ethic, the reality is less edifying. The lesson here is that big business political rent-seeking is alive and thriving. 
"The carbon-based free lunch is over," declared Exelon CEO John Rowe, neglecting to mention that his company's free lunch is only beginning. Under the House's climate-change bill, a few utilities -- primarily those that have made big bets in renewable and nuclear energy -- are poised to clean up once Congress hands them carbon emission credits. The bill sets aside 35% of the free credits for utilities. Exelon and other "renewable" utilities will get a huge piece of that pie. 
An internal memo produced by Bernstein Research in June described how Mr. Rowe met with investors to rejoice that the House legislation will allow Exelon to rake in additional revenue -- by some estimates, up to $1.5 billion a year. Others will pay for this Exelon privilege, of course -- notably, Midwestern customers of traditional coal utilities who will see their energy prices double. But hey, all's fair in love and lobbying. 
"Seeking greater competitive advantage through regulatory means is, lamentably, an entrenched fact of life in some corporate boardrooms . . . But breaking with an organization and creating a public stage on which to tout a company's green credentials is overwrought. This is about profit, not Gaia," says Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe. 
Speaking of senators, the utility exodus conveniently came only days before Sen. Barbara Boxer released her own draft climate bill. And Mrs. Boxer, also conveniently, left blank the portion allocating credits -- all the better to bribe support out of key industry players by dangling precious goods in front of them. Emancipated from the Chamber, Exelon and others are free to play ball. The EPA's new emissions rules were also announced this week in tune with the Boxer bill, reminding companies that if they don't work with Congress, the EPA will make them pay without any compensating emissions credits. 
Let's also not forget that Chicago-based Exelon and employees, including Mr. Rowe, contributed tens of thousands of dollars for their home-city presidential aspirant. And that Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, was once a consultant to Exelon. In an energy world in which winners and losers are picked on the Potomac, there is no harm in reminding the president who his friends are. 
The move also keeps the mob at bay. Caught flat-footed by public outrage over health care, liberal interest groups are now attacking opponents of the Democratic agenda in personal terms. For the crime of talking straight about ObamaCare, former House leader Dick Armey and former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey have been targeted and lost jobs in the private sector. The Natural Resources Defense Council is attempting a similar takedown of Chamber President Tom Donahue, in retribution on climate. The utility execs hope to avoid that bull's-eye. As extra insurance, Mr. Rowe this spring taped an ad with the Environmental Defense Fund, the smoothest of the green lobbies, to plump for climate legislation. 
The Chamber's sin was giving the utilities the excuse to bolt by suggesting there be a "trial" on the science. The organization is doing its job, representing all its other members that will foot the climate bill. More astonishing than the exits from the Chamber is the news that the administration won't grant the business community's simple request to be transparent on its science. This obfuscation is becoming habit. 
The stonewalling of the Chamber follows the muzzling of a career EPA scientist -- Alan Carlin -- who had questioned the scientific basis of the agency's moves. The agency is now considering shuttering Mr. Carlin's entire department -- whose job it is to examine the economic consequences of agency rules. Treasury only reluctantly released climate documents demanded by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and only after redacting a section about cost. Under pressure, it recently released the complete documents. So only now are we discovering that Team Obama believes a climate bill could cost the economy up to $300 billion annually. 
The favored utilities don't mind this lack of transparency, since the more consumers realize how much they will pay for climate legislation, the less they support it. And save a few lucky utilities, pay America will.

WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed requiring new power plants, factories and oil refiners to obtain permits to emit so-called greenhouse gases, ratcheting up pressure on Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation. 
The EPA's proposal would effectively require new, large industrial facilities and existing ones undergoing modification to use the most up-to-date technology to curb carbon-dioxide emissions. The announcement came as environmentally minded Senate Democrats vowed to bring a newly unveiled climate bill to a vote before a major international summit on climate change in December. 
Other Democratic lawmakers from states dependent on coal and manufacturing jobs said they couldn't support the draft proposal, which calls for cutting U.S. emissions somewhat faster than a similar proposal narrowly approved by the House in June. 
"The EPA's ready to work with Congress," EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in announcing the proposal. "But we're not going to continue with business as usual while we wait for Congress to act." 
Because the federal Clean Air Act limits the EPA's ability to weigh the costs of new regulations, many businesses worry that new EPA rules might be unduly burdensome. To address such concerns, the EPA's proposal would effectively exempt small businesses such as restaurants and farms, applying the rules only to facilities that emit 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases or more a year. A threshold of 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide is comparable to the emissions from the annual energy use of about 2,200 homes, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. 
"The question is -- is this legal?" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. He said his group is skeptical the EPA would be allowed under current law to distinguish between small and large emitters when setting new controls on greenhouse gases. 
Under the EPA proposal, which officials said could take effect as early as next year, new power plants and other large emitters could be denied regulatory permits if they didn't use the most up-to-date technology to curb carbon-dioxide emissions. Similar technology would have to be incorporated into any major upgrades. The EPA is expected to spell out what kinds of controls would qualify in later guidance. 
Meanwhile, several key senators said a draft bill designed to fight climate change, announced by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) and John Kerry (D., Mass.), lacked sufficient support to pass the chamber. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D., W.Va.), said the bill's proposal to cut U.S. emissions 20% beneath 2005 levels by 2020 would be "unrealistic and harmful" for his coal-abundant state. Other lawmakers said the chamber's focus on health-care legislation was straining their ability to examine the measure. 
The climate-change issue also is dividing industry. Nike Inc. said Wednesday it was resigning a seat on the board of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, citing disagreement with the group's stance against proposed climate-change legislation. But the company said it planned to remain a member of the chamber. A chamber spokesman said its position "reflects the diversity of its membership and the broad business community."

Abstract 
Unlike the House bill, the Senate's draft bill would preserve the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases. Because that law generally gives the EPA limited flexibility to consider costs when setting regulations, some business groups and many lawmakers fear the agency's regulation of greenhouse gases could lead to onerous, new rules on business. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Top Senate Democrats plan Wednesday to unveil a draft climate bill calling for greater reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions than a House bill would require. 
But the proposal is expected to defer tough decisions on other major issues, underscoring the challenges lawmakers face in seeking a consensus. 
The proposal calls for cutting U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 20% from 2005 levels by 2020, according to a copy of a draft, as well as people close to the matter. 
The House bill, which passed in June, calls for cutting emissions 17% over the same period. 
California Democrat Barbara Boxer, who heads the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass), chairman of the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee, hope the draft legislation will give new momentum to climate change, an Obama administration priority that appears to have slid down Washington's to-do 

list. 
The House in June approved legislation that would require companies to hold permits to emit greenhouse gases. In the initial years, the government would give away most of 
the permits to industries, while allowing companies to trade permits among themselves. Over time, the government would issue fewer permits, bringing overall emissions down. 

The Senate proposal isn't expected to specify how the government would allocate billions of dollars worth of the permits. 

By remaining silent on that and other issues, the proposal effectively postpones for weeks many of the toughest questions associated with climate legislation, as senators wade 
deeper into the debate over health-care legislation. 
Administration officials have said they would like to get a climate bill signed into law before an international summit on climate change in December. But Senate Majority Leader 

Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has said any chamber vote may wait until next year. 

The Senate measure has already raised some worries. Keith McCoy, vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said his group was "concerned" about the 
direction of Ms. Boxer's proposal, but is withholding judgment. 
Republicans on Tuesday warned Ms. Boxer against publishing her proposal without specifying how emissions permits would be allocated. Without such details, they said, it would 

be impossible to gauge the bill's economic impact. 

"It is imperative that we have a complete bill well in advance of legislative hearings and markup," the seven Republican members of the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee said in a letter to Ms. Boxer on Tuesday. "Otherwise the legislative process will not paint a full and accurate picture of your legislation to the American people." 
Spokespersons for Ms. Boxer and Mr. Kerry didn't respond to calls seeking comment. People familiar with Ms. Boxer's thinking said she planned to flesh out details of her 

proposal in coming weeks, with a goal of bringing the legislation before her committee for a vote by the end of October. 
Unlike the House bill, the Senate's draft bill would preserve the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases. Because 

that law generally gives the EPA limited flexibility to consider costs when setting regulations, some business groups and many lawmakers fear the agency's regulation of greenhouse gases could lead to onerous, new rules on business. In a bid to gain support from moderates within the Democratic Party and potential Republican votes, the Boxer-Kerry draft also includes provisions to fund training of workers in 
the nuclear industry and development of technology that could reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. Credit: By Ian Talley and Stephen Power

U.S. News: Utility Quits U.S. Chamber Over Rift on Climate Bill

Abstract 
Exelon, PG&E and PNM all operate nuclear power plants and emit far less carbon dioxide than some of their peers, particularly companies that operate large fleets of coal-fired power plants. 

Full Text 
Exelon Corp. on Monday became the third big utility in the past week to quit the U.S. Chamber of Commerce over the influential business group's stance against federal climate-change legislation. 
The decision by Exelon, one of the nation's biggest nuclear power-plant operators, to quit the Chamber follows similar moves by PG&E Corp. and PNM Resources Inc. and highlights a growing rift between the nation's power sector and other industries over climate policy. 
Chicago-based Exelon said the U.S. government needs to set climate-change policy promptly, in part to allow energy markets to attach a price to cutting a ton of carbon-dioxide emissions. The House in June passed a bill that would require the U.S. to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 17% from 2005 levels by 2020, and create a market-based program called "cap and trade" in which companies could buy and sell the right to emit carbon dioxide. 
"The carbon-based free lunch is over," Exelon Chairman and Chief Executive John W. Rowe said in a statement. "But while we can't fix our climate problems for free, the price signal sent through a cap-and-trade system will drive low-carbon investments in the most inexpensive and efficient way possible." 
Exelon, PG&E and PNM all operate nuclear power plants and emit far less carbon dioxide than some of their peers, particularly companies that operate large fleets of coal-fired power plants. Coal plants produce roughly twice the greenhouse-gas emissions of similarly sized natural-gas-fired plants. Nuclear power plants emit almost no greenhouse-gas emissions, and so stand to benefit from legislation that would cap emissions. 
The companies' departures are unlikely to change the Chamber's position on climate-change policy, said David Chavern, the group's chief operating officer. He added that although the Chamber opposed a House bill to cap greenhouse-gas emissions and disagrees with plans by the Environmental Protection Agency to begin regulating emissions, it isn't opposed to some form of U.S. climate-change legislation. 
"Congress should do everything it can to promote and incentivize technology development and other policies that allow us to control carbon in ways that don't trash the economy," Mr. Chavern said. 
The climate debate was overshadowed in Washington most of the summer by the battle over proposals to overhaul the health-care system. But later this week, the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), is expected to introduce a Senate proposal to reduce U.S greenhouse-gas emissions. Whether the Senate will act on a proposal before an international climate summit in Copenhagen in December is unclear. 
Despite their differences, U.S. power companies, represented by the lobbying group Edison Electric Institute, have banded together in support of the climate-change legislation that passed the House. 
The U.S. Chamber opposed that bill, by Reps. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.). And it recently suggested that the U.S. come up with a forum to debate evidence that climate change is man-made, in response to a proposed finding by the EPA that global warming poses a danger to public health. 
"We are not debating the science behind global warming," William Kovacs, the chamber's senior vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs, said at the time. "We are unconvinced that EPA has demonstrated, as a matter of law, that greenhouse-gas emissions from motor vehicles in the U.S. endanger public health or welfare."

World News: China's Wind Farms Come With a Catch: Coal Plants

Abstract 
"China will need to add a substantial amount of coal-fired power capacity by 2020 in line with its expanding economy, and the idea is to bring some of the capacity earlier than necessary in order to facilitate the wind-power transmission," said Shi Pengfei, vice president of the Chinese Wind Power Association. 

Full Text 
SHANGHAI -- China's ambition to create "green cities" powered by huge wind farms comes with a dirty little secret: Dozens of new coal-fired power plants need to be installed as well. 
Part of the reason is that wind power depends on, well, the wind. To safeguard against blackouts when conditions are too calm, officials have turned to coal-fired power as a backup. 
China wants renewable energy like wind to meet 15% of its energy needs by 2020, double its share in 2005, as it seeks to rein in emissions that have made its cities among the smoggiest on Earth. But experts say the country's transmission network currently can't absorb the rate of growth in renewable-energy output. Last year, as much as 30% of wind-power capacity wasn't connected to the grid. As a result, more coal is being burned in existing plants, and new thermal capacity is being built to cover this shortfall in renewable energy. 
In addition, officials want enough new coal-fired capacity in reserve so that they can meet demand whenever the wind doesn't blow. This is important because wind is less reliable as an energy source than coal, which fuels two-thirds of China's electricity output. Wind energy ultimately depends on wind strength and direction, unlike coal, which can be stockpiled at generators in advance. 
Further complicating matters is poor connectivity between regional transmission networks, which makes it hard for China to move surplus power in one part of the country to cover shortfalls elsewhere. 
China may not be alone in having to ramp up thermal power capacity as it develops wind farms. Any country with a combination of rapidly growing energy demand, an old and inflexible grid, an existing reliance on coal for power, and ambitious renewable energy-expansion plans will likely have a similar dilemma. What marks China out as different is the amount of new coal-fired capacity that needs to be added. 
"China will need to add a substantial amount of coal-fired power capacity by 2020 in line with its expanding economy, and the idea is to bring some of the capacity earlier than necessary in order to facilitate the wind-power transmission," said Shi Pengfei, vice president of the Chinese Wind Power Association. 
Largely due to its reliance on coal, China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in absolute terms. Last year, the country accounted for more than 85% of global growth in coal demand, according to BP PLC's statistical review of world energy. 
Facing pressure from abroad over the pace of China's emissions growth, President Hu Jintao used a speech to the United Nations last Tuesday to stress his country's commitment to tackling climate change. He said China will lower energy intensity as the country grows, while raising output of renewable energy and nuclear power. 
The city of Jiuquan, in the flat and arid northwestern province of Gansu, shows the complexities that crop up when implementing such plans. Wind turbines with a combined capacity of 12.7 gigawatts are due to be installed there by 2015 -- more than the country's present nuclear-power capacity. 
But the Jiuquan government wants to build 9.2 gigawatts of new coal-fired generating capacity as well, for use when the winds aren't favorable. That's equivalent to the entire generating capacity of Hungary. 
Construction of these thermal power plants is pending approval by Beijing, an official with the Energy Department under the Jiuquan Development and Reform Bureau said Tuesday. 
To be sure, any kilowatt hour of wind power consumed by end users ultimately replaces a kilowatt hour of electricity generated by other, possibly dirty, sources such as coal, and the huge power supply expected from the new wind farms represents a major stride in China's clean energy push. 
China has plenty of windswept plains and sun-baked deserts to host turbines or solar panels, but these are often far from cities and existing infrastructure for shipping power. Sebastian Meyer, director of research and advisory services with clean-energy consultancy Azure International, says China needs a more modern and flexible grid if it wants to raise the share of renewable power in its energy mix.

Abstract 
President Barack Obama said the U.S. is "determined to act" to combat climate change, and Chinese President Hu Jintao said his country would cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by "a notable margin" over the next 11 years. 

Full text 
UNITED NATIONS -- The world's two largest greenhouse-gas emitters called for new action to curb emissions linked to climate change, but they didn't make any concrete new commitments themselves. 
President Barack Obama said the U.S. is "determined to act" to combat climate change, and Chinese President Hu Jintao said his country would cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by "a notable margin" over the next 11 years. But neither leader specified how his country would actually cut emissions. 
That reticence reflects the political realities both men confront at home: domestic industrial bases that, particularly amid a recession, don't want to sacrifice their global economic competitiveness in the name of the environment. And the impasse underscores how difficult it will be for diplomats to reach any significant global agreement to curb greenhouse-gas emissions when they meet in December at a big U.N. climate-change conference in Copenhagen. 
Messrs. Obama and Hu called climate change a serious issue and said they needed to work harder together to combat it. 
China and the U.S. together account for 40% of greenhouse-gas emissions, meaning the world won't significantly curb the heat-trapping pollutants without their participation. The two countries have been at odds for years over what steps each should have to take to limit emissions. 
Mr. Hu told world leaders that China will combat climate change in the next decade by meaningfully cutting carbon emitted per unit of gross domestic product by 2020. Mr. Hu said China would expand its forest coverage -- trees absorb carbon dioxide -- reduce coal consumption and by 2020 increase to 15% the share of energy it derives from renewable sources. 
But Mr. Hu didn't commit to a hard cap on emissions. Even if China emits less carbon per dollar of economic product, its overall emissions could grow. 
Mr. Obama said, as he has before, that the U.S. will act to combat climate change, and warned of "irreversible catastrophe" for future generations if the world doesn't limit greenhouse-gas emissions. But Mr. Obama's message was overshadowed by signs that Congress may delay action on a proposal to curb U.S. emissions, and by a skirmish in the Senate over proposals to scale back the Obama administration's authority to regulate emissions from various industries. 
Mr. Obama acknowledged the "doubts and difficulties" clouding climate legislation in Congress, but said the U.S. is determined to push for a treaty at a December summit in Copenhagen to limit countries' greenhouse-gas emissions. 
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the climate summit amid concerns that international talks on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions are stalling. On Tuesday, he said talks ahead of the summit were moving slowly. 
"Failure to reach broad agreement in Copenhagen would be morally inexcusable, economically short-sighted and politically unwise," Mr. Ban said. 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at the U.N. that with 87 days left until the Dec. 12 summit, "the time has passed for diplomatic bargaining." But agreements on key issues, such as how much rich nations are willing to pay poor nations to cut their emissions remain elusive. 
The African Union, for instance, is considering walking out of the Copenhagen meeting if rich nations don't pay its members $67 billion a year to develop non-carbon energy sources. 
In his speech, Mr. Obama focused on steps his administration has already taken to fight climate change, such as proposing rules to limit automobile emissions. In a further step Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new rules that will require refineries, cement kilns, glass manufacturers and other large facilities to monitor and report their emissions to the government. 
Mr. Obama said he would use a meeting of Group of 20 nations in Pittsburgh this week to push countries to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. The U.S. offers certain tax breaks to oil companies, some of which the Obama administration has proposed to eliminate. 
Oil producers have said that raising taxes on them will discourage domestic energy production and frustrate the administration's stated goal of curbing U.S. reliance on foreign oil. Mr. Obama has resisted proposals to raise fuel taxes that consumers pay directly, such as federal gasoline taxes.

BEIJING -- China's President Hu Jintao is expected to commit China to reducing carbon use but won't pledge any absolute caps on its greenhouse-gas emissions, according to analysts -- which could disappoint diplomats and climate-change activists who had hoped for more from the world's biggest greenhouse-gas producer. 
In a speech Tuesday before a United Nations summit on climate change, Mr. Hu is expected to say that China will include so-called carbon intensity targets in its next five-year plan, the economic blueprint for 2011-2015. That promise could help China take the global lead in the climate-change debate, even as it dovetails with domestic policies already in place. 
But China would only promise to use less carbon per dollar of economic product -- not reduce emissions overall. That may fail to impress U.S. lawmakers, to whom activists are also looking for concessions if a substantive international agreement is to be reached by December at a conference in Copenhagen. Proposed U.S. legislation would impose caps, but manufacturers argue that will hurt them in competition with China and other developing countries. 
A carbon intensity target would encourage China to burn more efficiently and rely more on cleaner alternatives, but won't limit how much coal China uses. 
Setting up carbon as a standard could set a framework for any future caps because China would need to measure its carbon emissions for the first time. But analysts warn that China's economy is growing so fast it could wipe out any gains made in other parts of the world unless it pursues a deep cut overall. 
China has said it wants a deal at the Copenhagen meeting to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
A bill in Congress to curb global warming has a lot of Texans boiling. 
The bill proposes to make some companies pay for the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases they emit, gases that scientists believe are contributing to rising temperatures. And that puts the Lone Star State, which produces more emissions than any other state and even some big industrialized countries like Canada, squarely in the cross-hairs. 
If the climate-change bill becomes law, it will have a severe impact on the Texas economy, local officials say. A study commissioned by the state comptroller says 135,000 to 277,000 jobs could be lost in 2012, the year the legislation would take effect. Roughly 312,000 people work in the oil and gas industries in the state, home to a quarter of the nation's refining capacity and to oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and ConocoPhillips. 
"This is a monster for the state, given the fact that so much of our revenue comes from [the energy] sector," says Comptroller Susan Combs in an interview. "It's going to hit us disproportionately." 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, has said he thinks the bill would "devastate" some of the industries that have helped his state weather the recession better than other regions. "To throttle that one bright spot is a little bit puzzling," Mr. Perry said at a June roundtable held in Austin to discuss possible effects of the legislation. Also, a national campaign against the bill, sponsored by the oil industry and other opponents, made its debut in Houston in August. 
Battle lines in the national debate over the bill highlight a growing split between mostly Republican states heavily invested in oil and gas production and Democratic-leaning coastal states that have invested in alternative sources of energy and rely on service industries. Joining Texas are the Oklahoma Legislature, which in May issued a statement against the bill, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who lambasted the proposal in a Washington Post op-ed column, calling it "an enormous threat." 
The bill, sponsored by U.S. Reps. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) and Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), won narrow approval in the House in June, but it is expected to face more heated debate in the Senate in coming months. Indeed, signs point to an uphill fight for the Obama administration as it tries to steer the country toward more expensive but cleaner sources of energy. 
"Cheap energy has been a cornerstone of American policy," says Robert Stein, a political-science professor at Rice University in Houston. 
And perhaps nowhere are the stakes as high as in Texas. A study commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington-based industry group that opposes the bill, projects that the measure would result in a loss of 1.95 million jobs by 2020 -- about 14% of which would be in Texas. In the same year, the study says, the legislation would cost the state's average household about $1,600 in lost purchasing power -- 58% greater than the predicted national average. 
Texas emits about three times as much carbon dioxide per dollar of economic output as California or New York, the study says. Texas also far surpasses California, a more populous state with a bigger economy, in total emissions, due to its penchant for big trucks, its hot, sprawling cities, and its slate of energy-intensive industries like aluminum and petrochemicals. 
Another reason Texas may take a bigger hit than other states: Refiners as a group would get less of a break than coal-powered generation facilities under the terms of the bill. The legislation proposes to give each polluter a certain allowance of emissions for which they don't initially have to pay. Companies would then have to buy permits for emissions that exceed their allowance. 
The bill would require refiners to account not only for the carbon they emit when processing fuel, but also for the tailpipe emissions generated by the gasoline and diesel they sell. Even so, they would receive only 2.25% of allowances allocated under the bill, even though they account for 44% of total CO2 emissions subject to the bill, while coal-based electricity producers' allowances would be much closer to their actual emissions, says Bill Durbin, a Houston-based consultant with Wood Mackenzie, a global energy consultancy. "That will be a significant upfront cost for refiners," he says. 
The Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, predicts the bill could add between 35 cents and $1.28 to the price of a gallon of gasoline by 2030 -- a premium that could erode fuel demand, and the health of a sector that represents about 15% of Texas' gross state product. 
But not all of Texas is opposed to carbon caps. Robert A. Webb, president of the Austin-based Texas Renewable Energy Industries Association, argues that the state's economy can become stronger as a result of the climate bill. Not only does Texas have a lot of renewable-energy potential, but much of its oil-industry labor can be redirected toward making carbon-emitting facilities more efficient, Mr. Webb says. 
"While we will have a temporary disruption, Texas is strong," he says. "Moreover, a lot of Texas industries can benefit." Mr. Webb is general counsel for Biofuels Power Corp., a power provider based in The Woodlands, Texas, that generates electricity from biofuels. 
Some state Democratic proponents of the climate bill also say it could help nudge the state toward a more diversified, environmentally friendly economy. Indeed, Texas leads the U.S. not only in oil refining and natural-gas production, but also in wind-power capacity. 
"As we move into renewables, Texas stands to gain more than other states," says U.S. Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D., Texas), who sits on the House committee that moved the initial version of the bill. 
But Ms. Combs, the state comptroller, says the wind industry has created only 500 to 800 permanent jobs in the state, a small fraction of the jobs that she believes will be lost. "I don't know where the new jobs are going to come from," Ms. Combs says. "They're not going to come from wind." Landing a green job in Texas, she adds, could be akin to finding a "unicorn -- a sort of mythical beast."

Abstract 
While he said Tuesday's closed-door meeting was "not a negotiation forum," Mr. Ban said he expected the leaders to "to give their negotiating teams marching orders to accelerate progress toward an . . . ambitious global climate agreement." 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Barack Obama promised strong action on climate change from his first day in office, but he is heading into a series of meetings with other world leaders this month under growing pressure to deliver on his rhetoric. 
More than 100 world leaders, including Mr. Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, are scheduled to meet Tuesday at the 64th United Nations General Assembly to talk about fighting climate change, in a prelude to the Pittsburgh Group of 20 meetings starting Thursday. 
While the talk will be about the environment, the substance will be about money. Poor nations say that if rich nations want them to stop burning coal or cutting down forests, they should be willing to pay. 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made global warming a focus, and he is worried that the meeting won't move the ball forward toward a new global climate-change treaty in Copenhagen this December to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. 
"We want world leaders to show they understand the gravity of climate risks, as well as the benefits of acting now," Mr. Ban said. "We want them to publicly commit to sealing a deal in Copenhagen." 
While he said Tuesday's closed-door meeting was "not a negotiation forum," Mr. Ban said he expected the leaders to "to give their negotiating teams marching orders to accelerate progress toward an . . . ambitious global climate agreement." 
China has proposed that developed nations contribute 1% of gross domestic product to subsidize efforts by poorer nations to cut carbon-dioxide emissions. That translates to more than $140 billion for the U.S. alone. U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern says the Chinese proposal is "untethered from reality." 
Separately, China is trying to establish a voluntary market to encourage companies and individuals to reduce emissions. China Beijing Environment Exchange is scheduled to launch the country's first voluntary carbon standard in New York on Wednesday. 
Mr. Obama's administration has begun to act on its own to cut emissions. Last week, the administration rolled out details of its strategy to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from cars. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said the proposal paves the way for regulating emissions from other sources, such as power plants. 
But a broad proposal to limit U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions is bogged down in the Senate, with Republicans solidly opposed and Democrats divided. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), said earlier this month that the Senate might delay a vote on climate legislation until next year. A spokesman for Mr. Reid later clarified that the measure could still come to the floor by year end. 
Mr. Reid's wavering added to the frustration among countries that had hoped for major progress toward a new global climate deal at the Copenhagen summit. 
"Is the U.S. Senate really expecting all the other countries to make a serious effort on climate change at the Copenhagen Conference in the absence of a clear commitment from the United States?" John Bruton, the European Union's ambassador to the U.S., said in a written statement last Thursday. "Asking an international Conference to sit around looking out the window for months, while one chamber of the legislature of one country deals with its other business, is simply not a realistic political position." 
Republicans say whatever deal the Obama administration cuts in Copenhagen will likely be dead on arrival in Washington. The gaps between developed and developing nations' demands, they say, are too wide to be bridged. 
Wisconsin Rep. James Sensenbrenner, the top Republican on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, predicts "a repeat of Kyoto -- namely an environmentally ineffective agreement that cannot be ratified" by the Senate. 
Not everyone is gloomy about the prospects for a deal in Copenhagen. Connie Hedegaard, Denmark's climate and energy minister, says she sees hope in the fact that Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, recently pledged that his country will seek to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020 -- a much bigger cut than the 8% goal set by former Prime Minister Taro Aso. 
Still, big differences remain between the U.S. and Europe on fundamental issues, including how quickly rich countries should have to cut their emissions over the next decade or so. While the European Union has pledged to cut its emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 -- and to increase that reduction to 30% if other major emitters do the same -- the most aggressive proposal in Congress to curb U.S. emissions calls for a 4% reduction beneath 1990 levels by 2020.

Abstract 
The vote signals that the EU is in no rush to tackle the deep divides that persist despite years of growing economic cohesion. Since its founding in 1957 as a steel-and-coal trading alliance, the EU has secured unprecedented peace, invented a common currency and united Eastern and Western Europe. 

Full Text 
STRASBOURG, France -- The European Union picked Jose Manuel Barroso for a second five-year term as president of the European Commission, committing to a cautious consensus-builder. 
The reappointment of Mr. Barroso, a center-right former Portuguese prime minister, was eased by a shift to the right in June's European Parliament elections; the parliament has the authority to confirm the commission president, who is nominated by national leaders. 
Mr. Barroso was the only candidate. The parliament's 184 socialists refused to support him but couldn't muster enough dissent from others in the 736-seat chamber to block him. 
The commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm, both initiates the EU's laws and enforces them -- a dual role that makes it particularly powerful in Brussels. 
The vote signals that the EU is in no rush to tackle the deep divides that persist despite years of growing economic cohesion. Since its founding in 1957 as a steel-and-coal trading alliance, the EU has secured unprecedented peace, invented a common currency and united Eastern and Western Europe. 
But members disagree on whether to admit Turkey, continue subsidizing agriculture, create a federal United States of Europe, or turn to protectionism to save local industries. The future of the EU "is a paper system that needs to be filled with real life," says Piotr Kaczynski, an analyst with the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies. "In 1790, nobody imagined what would be the American system of government." 
Mr. Barroso, 53 years old, presents a comfortable middle ground who won't ruffle feathers on any side of those debates. 
Analysts say he will stick to the script on the two biggest challenges of his coming term: Writing new laws to ease global warming and ward off another financial meltdown. The EU supports broad emissions cuts backed by aid for developing nations, and giving some power to an international financial supervisory board. Mr. Barroso supports limits on "unethical" corporate bonuses. 
His previous term was marked by the emergence of anti-EU sentiment in several nations. Less than a year after he took office in October 2004, voters in France and the Netherlands vetoed a proposed European constitution. A watered-down document, the Lisbon Treaty, was rejected by the Irish last year and faces a second shot at approval in a referendum next month. Under Mr. Barroso, the commission launched tight regulation of chemicals and carbon emissions, fined Microsoft Corp. and other companies more than $10 billion for antitrust violations, and slapped tariffs on Asian shoe imports. 
In coming weeks, Mr. Barroso's chief task will be assembling the rest of the commission. Commissioners -- one nominated by each country -- have portfolios including competition and trade, which can have a big impact on global markets. 
Mr. Barroso is also expected to be joined in Brussels by another president. If Irish voters approve the Lisbon Treaty, the assembly of EU national leaders will get a permanent president and a foreign minister.

Abstract 
[...] the waste bugaboo is truly unfathomable. 

Full Text 
The three issues of cost, safety and waste aren't unique to nuclear power ("The New Nukes," The Journal Report on Energy, Sept. 8) and should be honestly assessed for all 
energy technologies. 
Fossil-energy costs, especially coal, are very low until you start counting indirect effects such as air pollution's impact on everything from people to buildings, the potential costs 
of climate change and the more mundane costs of simple land despoliation from mining. The wind doesn't always blow and costly backups are needed for reliability, and solar 
cells are expensive. 

Nuclear safety continues to be more of a political issue than a real issue, as its safety record is outstanding. While mining, traffic and construction accidents are much higher for 

coal and wind energy production than for nuclear, they don't make great headlines. 
Finally, the waste bugaboo is truly unfathomable. The mercury and other pollutants that go up the stack or end up in ash piles at coal plants already harm people, while nuclear 
waste is small in volume and easily stored. Wind power creates wastes from the vast amount of concrete, steel and other materials needed to generate a fairly small amount of 
power, and for some solar cells we have wastes from very toxic heavy metal, like arsenic. The real question to ask is, in aggregate, where do we get the most energy for the 
least impact? We need all resources: wind, solar and nuclear, and nuclear is still near the top of that list. 

Prof. William H. Miller Nuclear Science & Engineering Institute University of Missouri-Columbia Columbia, Mo. 
I am of the generation that was told that nuclear power would be too cheap to meter. We all know the accuracy of that prediction. 

Would you buy a house that costs two times its construction estimate and that required you to store all its garbage on site, would last only 40 years and would cost more to 
vacate than to build? I don't think so. 
Security of exhausted fuel storage is almost nonexistent and is far more vulnerable to compromise than are core shielding and containment structures.

"Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months," said a statement released Monday evening 
by his publicist, Annett Wolf. Mr. Swayze died in Los Angeles, Ms. Wolf said, but declined to give further details. 
Fans of the actor were saddened to learn in March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from a particularly deadly form of cancer. He kept working despite the diagnosis, putting 

together a memoir with his wife and shooting "The Beast," an A&E drama series for which he had already made the pilot. 

Mr. Swayze said he opted not to use painkilling drugs while making "The Beast" because they would have taken the edge off his performance. The show drew a respectable 1.3 
million viewers when the 13 episodes ran in 2009, but A&E said it had reluctantly decided not to renew it for a second season. 
When he first went public with the illness, some reports gave him only weeks to live, but his doctor said his situation was "considerably more optimistic" than that. Mr. Swayze 

acknowledged that time might be running out. "I'd say five years is pretty wishful thinking," Mr. Swayze told ABC's Barbara Walters in early 2009. "Two years seems likely if 
you're going to believe statistics. I want to last until they find a cure, which means I'd better get a fire under it."

CALIFORNIA 
Accused Kidnapper's Bail 
Is Set at $30 Million 

A judge on Monday set bail at $30 million for a Northern California man accused of kidnapping a girl and holding her captive for 18 years. 
In setting the high amount, El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister cited the serious nature of the charges, injuries to the girl and the fact that Phillip Garrido 
was on parole at the time of the alleged abduction. 

Mr. Garrido, 58 years old, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54, have pleaded not guilty to 29 charges of kidnapping, rape and false imprisonment charges and have been held 

without bail in an El Dorado County jail. 
The couple are accused of kidnapping 11-year-old Jaycee Dugard from her home in 1991 then holding her captive in a backyard jumble of tents and sheds for nearly two 
decades. Authorities say Mr. Garrido fathered two daughters with Ms. Dugard.

MASSACHUSETTS Boston Celtics Co-Owner Considers Senate Run Stephen Pagliuca, a private-equity investor and co-owner of the Boston Celtics, is plotting a potential run for the Democratic nomination to fill Edward Kennedy's U.S. Senate 
seat. 
Mr. Pagliuca, a managing director at Bain Capital, one of the nation's largest private-equity firms, could be a formidable candidate. 
With a personal fortune estimated at several hundred million dollars, Mr. Pagliuca could easily outspend the three local politicians who have already thrown their hats in the ring -- Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, and U.S. Reps. Michael Capuano and Stephen Lynch. 
Mr. Pagliuca, 54 years old, would be following in the footsteps of Mitt Romney, his former boss at Bain Capital who left the firm to launch a political career in 1994 with an unsuccessful Senate race against Mr. Kennedy.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
Interior Sets Up Council 
To Tackle Global Warming 
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar moved Monday to prepare the nation's parks, refuges and endangered species for the onslaught of global warming. 
Mr. Salazar signed an order setting up a Climate Change Response Council and eight regional response centers to study and respond to such issues as rising sea levels 

threatening to swamp historic structures and warmer temperatures shifting where wildlife live. 
The order also commits the Interior Department to develop a plan to reduce its own greenhouse-gas emissions, including setting a firm target. 
"The realities of climate change require us to change how we manage . . . the resources we oversee," the order reads. 
Earlier this year, Mr. Salazar directed the Interior Department to jump-start renewable-energy development. Monday's action builds on that effort by launching a project to 

develop ways to store carbon dioxide on park, refuge, and tribal lands.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
Panel Probes Possible Link 
Between Cellphones, Cancer 
Lawmakers are examining the relationship between cellphones and brain cancer, suggesting more research may be needed to determine the safety of cellphone use. 
"It's a serious question, and a serious question ought to get a serious analysis," Sen. Arlen Specter (D., Pa.) said at a hearing Monday. Mr. Specter, a cancer survivor, is a 

longtime champion of funding basic cancer research. 

Studies have shown no conclusive relationship between brain cancer and cellphone use. Scientists testifying at a Senate panel said better data are needed to determine whether 
the low levels of radiation from cellphones have a long-term impact. 
Wireless-communications devices are used by more than 270 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health.

TENNESSEE 
TVA to Provide $40 Million 
To City Affected by Ash Spill 
The Tennessee Valley Authority will provide $40 million to help restore the image and economy of Kingston that suffered a massive coal ash spill from a TVA power plant, 

officials announced Monday. 
Officials said the payment is more about the way the community is perceived than about environmental damage. 
"This is all about economic development," TVA top environmental executive Anda Ray said. "It is not about any kind of settlement issue at all. It is about looking forward to a 

future [when] . . . people will look at Roane County and say, 'I want to come here. I want to retire here. I want to raise my family here.'" 

Some wonder if $40 million will be enough to offset the impact of 5.4 million cubic yards of toxin-laden coal ash spilling Dec. 22, 2008, into the rivers of a community that relies on attracting Rust Belt and Florida retirees to its lakeside homes. -- Associated Press 
CRIME Murder, Manslaughter Drop Murder and manslaughter dropped almost 4% last year, as reported crime overall fell around the country, according to new data released Monday by the FBI. The 3.9% decline in killings reported to police was part of a nationwide drop in violent crime of 1.9% from 2007 to 2008. Rapes declined 1.6%, to the lowest national number in 
20 years -- about 89,000.

Full Text 
Robert Bryce raises legitimate concerns about the threat of wind turbines to bird populations ("Windmills Are Killing Our Birds," op-ed Sept. 8). But the answer is not defending a fossil fuel status quo that poses far greater risks; it lies instead in improved site selection and design for green energy facilities. 
Mr. Bryce admits that modern turbines can dramatically reduce avian hazards, and the technology is improving rapidly. Proper site selection makes things better still. Consultations between energy and wildlife experts can steer wind turbines away from major flyways and designated Important Bird Areas and toward lands with huge wind potential but far less habitat value. 
Audubon and others are working on vital mapping projects to focus site selection on areas already degraded by human activity -- and least likely to threaten birds. 
The status quo of oil and coal development has already destroyed or degraded countless acres of habitat essential to birds, wildlife and healthy communities. You don't see carcasses, but the toll is undeniable and increasing. Meanwhile, fossil fuel-driven climate change is already disrupting migratory and nesting patterns around the world. If not addressed, scientists predict it will drive entire species to extinction; that's far worse than the threat from any wind turbine.

Full Text 
PARIS -- France is likely to begin taxing carbon-dioxide emissions by both households and companies starting next year in the hope that consumers and producers gradually shift to more environmentally friendly goods. 
From Jan. 1, a special tax of 17 euros ($24.74) will be levied on each metric ton of CO2 emitted by fossil fuels such as heating oil, gasoline, coal and natural gas, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a speech Thursday. "We cannot keep on taxing labor, taxing capital and ignore taxes on pollution," he said. 
Parliament has yet to approve the measure, but it is likely to pass as part of the wider annual budget plan. 
Like other European countries and the U.S., France is seeking ways to meet a series of environmental commitments. The French government has pledged to cut its CO2 emissions to one-quarter of 1990 levels by 2050 by relying on nuclear power -- which generates few greenhouse gases -- better insulating buildings and boosting the use of renewable energies. 
France wants to emulate Finland and Sweden, which have succeeded in curbing C02 emissions with the introduction of greenhouse-gas taxes in the early 1990s. Mr. Sarkozy is also eager to show that France is making progress on its environmental promises ahead of a United Nations conference on climate change in Copenhagen in December. 
The carbon tax, however, has become a hard sell. When Mr. Sarkozy was elected president in 2007, surveys showed that French people backed the idea. More recent opinion polls suggest enthusiasm has faded as people grow wary that the tax will dent their spending power amid the economic crisis. 
In his speech, Mr. Sarkozy said the tax would help the French economy grow while being energy conscious. He added the tax would be offset by subsidies for some payers. Taxes and subsidies would rise in following years, but Mr. Sarkozy offered few details on the timeline or rate of change. 
Yet, environmentalists were skeptical of the tax's benefit. They said it has been set at a low level and criticized the subsidies planned for households and business to offset its impact. 
"With this tax, the incentive to shift to energy-efficient goods will be close to zero," said Pascal Husting, head of the French branch of Greenpeace. 
Mr. Sarkozy's plan falls short of recommendations from a report he commissioned that called for setting the tax at 32 euros per ton of CO2 in 2010 and increasing it by 5% every year after in order to reach a level of 100 euros in 2030. The 100 euros mark is necessary to achieve the broader goal of slashing CO2 emissions, the report said. 
The French president said he opted for an across-the-board level of 17 euros a ton because he was concerned that households wouldn't agree to pay significantly higher taxes on CO2 emissions than big industrial emitters -- which are already subject to a European Union mechanism aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. European CO2 emission certificates trade at about 15 euros. 
Mr. Sarkozy, who has pledged not to increase taxes despite France's rapidly widening budget deficit, has said the money raised through the new tax would be returned to taxpayers. 
Households subject to income tax will be awarded tax rebates as early as February 2010; those that are exempted from income tax will receive a check from the fiscal administration. Companies won't be awarded rebates but a local corporate tax will be scrapped to help offset the new carbon tax.

Abstract 
Credible or not, Mr. Josefsson's gambit comes at a pivotal time for business, as policies emerge that could profoundly change the energy landscape. With his distinctive snowy hair and piercing blue eyes, he is now a key figure in the global nexus of politicians, businessmen and environmentalists lobbying for global action on decarbonizing the planet. 

Full Text 
Here's a thing you don't see very often: the head of one of the world's dirtiest industries making common cause with climate-change campaigners. 
Lars Goran Josefsson is chief executive of Vattenfall AB, Europe's fifth-largest electricity producer. His company is hardly the cleanest on the planet: Four of its plants feature in the dirty 30, a list of Europe's biggest carbon-dioxide emitters, compiled by the European Union's executive branch. 
But that hasn't stopped Mr. Josefsson, 58, from becoming one of Europe's most influential voices on global warming. In June he was appointed an adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on energy and climate change. He was also climate adviser to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, during Germany's presidency of the European Union. 
For Mr. Josefsson, business is now in a "paradigm shift." For too long, CEOs took a back seat, leaving it to politicians to "design the future," he says. Those days are over. "Business will have to be much more proactive, take much more responsibility for the rules of the game," he says in an interview in Vattenfall's Stockholm headquarters. That's why he has committed Vattenfall to carbon-neutrality by 2050. 
Eco-warriors dismiss his rhetoric as "greenwashing." 
"The fact is, more than 75% of Vattenfall's investments still go into nonrenewable energy," says Martina Kruger, a Greenpeace coordinator based in Sweden. Mr. Josefsson's 2050 goal, she says, is "not credible." 
Credible or not, Mr. Josefsson's gambit comes at a pivotal time for business, as policies emerge that could profoundly change the energy landscape. World leaders will gather in Copenhagen in December to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. That could result in substantial mandated cuts in industrialized countries' emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is to take up the Waxman-Markey energy bill, which would cap overall CO2 emissions and require companies to buy permits to emit carbon. 
Western businesses are scrambling to figure out how the new policies will affect their operations. Some have responded by lobbying against climate legislation. That has echoes of the past, when companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. pooh-poohed the very idea of global warming. 
Others, especially in Europe, have taken a radically different stance, accepting the need to cool the planet and putting themselves at the heart of the debate about how to do it. Vattenfall is at the forefront. In 2007, Mr. Josefsson helped set up the 3C Initiative, which saw 67 companies, including General Electric Co., BP PLC and Siemens AG, agree to create a "low-emitting society." With his distinctive snowy hair and piercing blue eyes, he is now a key figure in the global nexus of politicians, businessmen and environmentalists lobbying for global action on decarbonizing the planet. 
His advocacy has heartened at least some in Europe who are desperate for a new global deal in Copenhagen. But their enthusiasm is tempered by reality. 
"Lars has been more eloquent on this issue than almost any other CEO I know," says Jules Kortenhorst, head of the European Climate Foundation, a Dutch-based charity. "But like any CEO, he faces competitive and shareholder pressures that limit his freedom to operate." 
Mr. Josefsson describes himself as a "stranger to energy." For 24 years, he worked for the Swedish telecommunications company Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, starting out as a radar engineer. He joined Vattenfall, which is wholly owned by the Swedish state, in 2000. 
In contrast to the high-tech world of telecoms, the power industry was highly regulated and monopolistic. But it was on the cusp of change. The EU was liberalizing European energy markets, and a wave of consolidation swept the fragmented utility sector. "To survive, you need to be big," says Mr. Josefsson. 
In 1998, Germany's electricity market was deregulated, and a year later, Vattenfall bought a stake in HEW, a power company in Hamburg. Over the next few years it snapped up more assets in Germany and now generates 13% of the country's electricity. 
Vattenfall, which means waterfall in Swedish, was for most of its history a zero-emissions company, relying on hydropower and nuclear energy. That all changed when it went international. Former communist East Germany's power industry was heavily reliant on brown coal, or lignite, which is strip-mined in open pits that can sometimes be the size of small towns. Emissions from brown-coal-fired plants are generally much higher than those from plants fired by black coal. Suddenly, Vattenfall changed from being one of the lowest emitters in Europe to one of the highest. 
That had major implications for the company. The EU's cap-and-trade system set an overall ceiling for total emissions that would be lowered over time. Under its first phase, installations got their emission allowances free. But from 2013, a large share of the permits are likely to be auctioned. Companies like Vattenfall will take a big hit unless they drastically cut their greenhouse gases. 
Vattenfall started to invest in nonfossil fuels -- renewables and nuclear -- and new technologies to clean emissions from coal-burning power stations. In 2008, it opened Europe's first carbon-capture-and-storage pilot plant, at its Schwarze Pumpe power station in eastern Germany. 
It created one of the world's largest wind farms, Lillgrund, just off the south coast of Sweden: with 48 turbines, it powers around 60,000 households. It has also announced plans to invest more than $3 billion in Britain's growing wind-energy market by 2018, and has become partners with ScottishPower Renewables, a unit of Spain's Iberdrola Renewables SA, to make joint bids on the U.K.'s latest round of offshore wind projects. The pair say their goal is to have 6 gigawatts of wind power up and running by 2020. 
Vattenfall is also branching into ocean power. Earlier this year it acquired a 51% stake in Irish marine energy firm Pandion Ltd. 
But when it comes to traditional forms of energy, the Swedish energy giant has often found itself facing fierce criticism. Critics have targeted its aging nuclear plant in Krummel, near Hamburg, which experienced an emergency shutdown in July caused by a short circuit in one of its transformers. The incident sparked a furious response from Chancellor Merkel and fed into an election campaign debate between Germany's main parties about the future of the country's nuclear industry. The opposition SPD has called for Krummel to be shut down for good. 
Mr. Josefsson stresses that there was no safety risk in the short circuit. But he acknowledges "it meant we lose credibility and trust." 
Its fossil-fuel legacy has also caused problems for Vattenfall. It has been slammed by environmental groups for its plans to build a huge coal-fired power plant in the Moorburg neighborhood of Hamburg. Greenpeace last year put up a sign at the construction site with a picture of Mr. Josefsson and the words: "This is Merkel's climate adviser! Result: more and more coal plants!" 
The Moorburg issue has now gone international. The Hamburg city government approved the project in 2008, but later imposed tough new restrictions to make it less environmentally harmful. Vattenfall said the demands would make the plant uneconomic and has taken the unusual step of seeking international arbitration. It has accused Germany of breaching the Energy Charter Treaty, a 1994 agreement to develop energy cooperation between Europe and the former Soviet republics, and appealed to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, a Washington D.C.-based organization affiliated with the World Bank. 
Greenpeace maintains its skeptical stance toward Vattenfall. "Sure they're investing in renewables," says Ms. Kruger. "But it's not enough to save us from climate change. It's more PR than real investment." 
Mr. Josefsson brushes aside the criticism. Its role as one of Europe's main power generators means Vattenfall will play a key role in any global movement to fight climate change. "If you're a part of the problem then you can legitimately say you're also part of the solution," he says.

Abstract 
Not only are they participating in the nation's first co-operative solar farm -- a pioneering venture set up by the electric-utility co-op serving their area -- they are playing a small role in an emerging and potentially significant trend in the nation's energy landscape: A move by rural co-ops into renewable-energy production. United Power, the local utility co-op, has tried to encourage conservation by giving out 50,000 free compact fluorescent light bulbs, but the organization says it doesn't have the resources to help customers install renewable-energy systems.

BRIGHTON, Colo. -- Every now and then, Dorothy and Dan Oberhausen take a little detour to check in on their solar panels. 
The two panels aren't much to look at. They are just standard-issue photovoltaic cells, facing due south and angled skyward, set in a scruffy, weed-choked field. 
But the Oberhausens couldn't be prouder. 
Not only are they participating in the nation's first co-operative solar farm -- a pioneering venture set up by the electric-utility co-op serving their area -- they are playing a small role in an emerging and potentially significant trend in the nation's energy landscape: A move by rural co-ops into renewable-energy production. 
These nonprofit utilities, which are owned by their members and supply power to 42 million Americans in 47 states, have long lagged behind other utilities in their use of solar, wind and geothermal resources. Part of the reason is that in many large states, including Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Texas, co-ops are exempt from laws requiring that utilities shift steadily to renewable sources of power. 
In the past year, however, some prominent rural co-ops have invested in massive solar and wind projects. Others have experimented with small-scale innovations to educate their rural customers, often conservative and very cost-conscious, about renewable energy's potential. 
Environmentalists aren't ready to hand out gold stars yet; they say rural co-ops remain far too reliant on old-style, coal-fired power plants. Still, some see clear signs of progress. "These are all good developments," says Bruce Driver, an energy consultant to the environmental group Western Resource Advocates, which is based in Boulder, Colo. Co-ops, he says, "are starting to think differently than they were even two or three years ago." 
The solar farm here in Brighton, a fast-growing, working-class town northeast of Denver, was born out of frustration. 
United Power, the local utility co-op, has tried to encourage conservation by giving out 50,000 free compact fluorescent light bulbs, but the organization says it doesn't have the resources to help customers install renewable-energy systems. 
By contrast, utility giant Xcel Energy Inc. offers hefty rebates to bring down the cost of solar power for homeowners; across Colorado, more than 5,000 have signed up. A state grant let United Power offer similar rebates for the first time last year, but only to 11 customers. 
"I got a ton of applications, but once the money was used up, it was, 'Thanks for calling, talk to you next year,' " says Jerry Marizza, the co-op's New Energy Program coordinator. "It wasn't a solar program, it was a solar lottery." 
Then Mr. Marizza had an idea. Instead of subsidizing solar panels for a handful of wealthy homeowners, why not invite a broad swath of green-minded families to subsidize a solar farm? 
Here's how it works: For $1,050, an investor gets a 25-year lease on a photovoltaic panel set up on United Power's land. The co-op takes care of installation, insurance and maintenance. ("We'll squeegee it once a month," Mr. Marizza promises.) Investors can visit their panels any time and track their energy output online. Each month, they get credit on their bill for that amount. 
The leasing fee works out to about $5 per watt, or roughly as much as an individual homeowner would pay to install a residential solar system after taking advantage of the federal tax credit. Utility rebates, where available, can reduce the cost of home-based solar systems even further, to about $3.50 per watt. While the solar farm can't match that, Mr. Marizza says the farm concept allows investors to buy a single panel at a time, adding more as their budget permits. And investors keep their panels, and credits, even if they move. (If they move out of United Power's service area, they can donate the credits to a local charity and earn a tax deduction.) 
A single panel generates a credit of about $3 to $4 a month; depending on rate increases, it might take 17 to 25 years to recoup the investment. 
That long time horizon didn't bother Rick Newman, who manages a manufacturing plant and sits on the co-op board. 
Mr. Newman called his wife and three children into a family meeting and they all agreed to sacrifice summer travel plans to purchase a solar panel. "Times are tough, but we took it out of our budget to make a statement," Mr. Newman says. 
While some other utilities also offer lease arrangements, the deals are generally reserved for homeowners in sunny locales. Typically, these utilities will install solar panels on homes at no charge, pocketing the federal tax credit for themselves, and then allow the homeowner to use the power the panels generate for a fixed monthly fee. Such programs were developed for commercial properties and began migrating to the residential market about a year ago. 
Mr. Marizza boasts that his solar farm is far more flexible. It is open to renters, office-park tenants, homeowners with heavily shaded roofs -- even customers outside the United Power service area who might want to invest in green energy and donate the power their panels generate to a local charity. 
The solar farm -- which United Power expects to break even on within a year -- is just one example of a shifting co-op culture. 
Tri-State Generation & Transmission Association Inc., which supplies electricity to electric co-operatives throughout a 250,000 square-mile service territory across Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico and Wyoming, has announced plans to develop a 30-megawatt solar plant in New Mexico, among the largest in the nation. Tri-State also is investing in a vast wind farm in eastern Colorado. The Minnkota Power Cooperative Inc., which serves parts of North Dakota and Minnesota, has pledged that fully a third of its power will come from wind by the end of the year. 
Smaller co-ops are getting in the act, too. The Highline Electric Association, which serves parts of Colorado and Nebraska, has launched a project to recover hot exhaust from a natural-gas compressor. The heat is then converted into as much as four megawatts of electricity The Delta-Montrose Electric Association in western Colorado subsidizes geothermal exchange pumps for residential customers. 
Rural co-ops traditionally have shied away from clean-energy projects for both financial and cultural reasons. As nonprofits, they can't take advantage of federal tax credits for generating energy from renewable sources, while federal loans for traditional coal-fired plants have been plentiful. Co-ops also tend to be run by conservative members who aren't eager to take on the burden of innovation in the name of fighting global warming. Their attitude is, "this is a global problem, not something that's solved on a local level," says Ken Anderson, general manager for Tri-State. 
But new incentives and requirements are prodding change. The stimulus bill set aside $2.4 billion to help co-ops and publicly owned utilities issue bonds for clean-energy projects -- up from $800 million last year. And many states, including Colorado, have stopped exempting co-ops from renewable-energy mandates. In Colorado, the co-ops must generate 10% of their power from renewable sources by 2010. Other states require co-ops to move toward generating 20% or even 30% of their power from renewables. The result is that co-ops nationwide boosted renewable capacity (apart from hydropower) by 65% last year, according to the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, a trade group representing the industry. 
The Oberhausens welcome the shift. 
Trains crammed with coal pass by their backyard in Brighton several times a day, keeping them aware of what is being burned to keep their fridge humming and their lights on. 
Though they have the space for solar panels on their property, the Oberhausens, both retired, say they don't want the hassle; they worry about vandalism, insurance costs and maintenance. 
They plan to soon draw down their retirement funds to purchase another 30 panels in United Power's solar farm, which would fully offset their home energy use. For now, they drive by regularly to watch, with pride, as their photovoltaic crop soaks up the Colorado sunshine.

Abstract 
Making It Safer For many people, talk of nuclear power conjures up memories of two accidents: the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the more extensive power surge that destroyed the reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986. 

Full Text 
If there ever were a time that seemed ripe for nuclear energy, it's now. 
For the first time in decades, popular opinion is on the industry's side. A majority of Americans thinks nuclear power, which emits virtually no carbon dioxide, is a safe and effective way to battle climate change, according to recent polls. At the same time, legislators are showing renewed interest in nuclear as they hunt for ways to slash greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The industry is seizing this chance to move out of the shadow of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and show that it has solved the three big problems that have long dogged it: cost, safety and waste. Researchers are working on reactors that they claim are simpler, cheaper in certain respects, and more efficient than the last generation of plants. 
Some designs try to reduce the chance of accidents by automating safety features and minimizing the amount of hardware needed to shut down the reactor in an emergency. Others cut costs by using standardized parts that can be built in big chunks and then shipped to the site. Some squeeze more power out of uranium, reducing the amount of waste produced, while others wring even more energy out of spent fuel. 
"Times are exciting for nuclear," says Ronaldo Szilard, director of nuclear science and engineering at the Idaho National Lab, a part of the U.S. Energy Department. "There are lots of options being explored." 
But nuclear is far from a sure thing. Yes, the plants of tomorrow -- some of which could enter construction as soon as 2012 -- go at least part way toward solving some of the problems of yesterday. But they are still more expensive than fossil-fuel plants, and they still generate waste that must be stored safely somewhere. 
And while the industry is winning converts, plenty of powerful enemies remain. Many scientists and environmentalists still distrust nuclear power in any form, arguing that it can never escape its cost, safety and waste problems. What's more, critics say, trying to solve the problems in one area, such as safety, inevitably lead to more problems in another area, such as costs. 
Here's a closer look at how the industry says it's addressing its longstanding problems -- and where skeptics say nuclear energy is still coming up short. 
Making It Safer 
For many people, talk of nuclear power conjures up memories of two accidents: the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the more extensive power surge that destroyed the reactor at Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986. 
As a whole, though, the U.S. nuclear industry has a solid safety record, and the productivity of plants has grown dramatically in the past decade. The next generation of reactors -- so-called Generation III units -- is intended to take everything that's been learned about safe operations and do it even better. Generation III units are the reactors of choice for most of the 34 nations that already have nuclear plants in operation. (China still is building a few Gen II units.) 
"A common theme of future reactors is to make them simpler so there are fewer systems to monitor and fewer systems that could fail," says Revis James, director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent power-industry research organization. 
The current generation of nuclear plants requires a complex maze of redundant motors, pumps, valves and control systems to deal with emergency conditions. Generation III plants cut down on some of that infrastructure and rely more heavily on passive systems that don't need human intervention to keep the reactor in a safe condition -- reducing the chance of an accident caused by operator error or equipment failure. 
For example, the Westinghouse AP1000 boasts half as many safety-related valves, one-third fewer pumps and only one-fifth as much safety-related piping as earlier plants from Westinghouse, majority owned by Toshiba Corp. In an emergency, the reactor, which has been selected for use at Southern Co.'s Vogtle site in Georgia and at six other U.S. locations, is designed to shut down automatically and stay within a safe temperature range. 
The reactor's passive designs take advantage of laws of nature, such as the pull of gravity. So, for example, emergency coolant is kept at a higher elevation than the reactor pressure vessel. If sensors detect a dangerously low level of coolant in the reactor core, valves open and coolant floods the reactor core. In older reactors, emergency flooding comes from a network of pumps -- which require redundant systems and backup sources of power -- and may also require operator action. 
Another big concern is how well a plant can handle a terrorist attack, especially the nightmare scenario of someone flying a jetliner into the reactor area. The Evolutionary Power Reactor from France's Areva SA, another Generation III design, guards against such an accident by putting the reactor inside a double containment building, which would shield the reactor vessel even if the outer shell were penetrated. The design also boasts four active and passive safety systems -- twice the number in many reactors today -- that could shut it down and keep the core cool in case of a mishap. Areva's EPRs are being built in Finland, France and China and four are under consideration for construction in the 
U.S. The Union of Concerned Scientists, a group critical of nuclear expansion, considers this the only design that is less vulnerable to a serious accident than today's operating reactors. 
Further out, Gen IV reactors, which use different fuels and coolants than Generation II and Generation III reactors, are designed to absorb excess heat better through greater coolant volume, better circulation and bigger containment structures. Advanced research into metal alloys that are resistant to cracking and corrosion should result in more suitable materials being used in plants, too, and giving them longer useful lives. 
Still, Generation III reactors are incredibly complex systems, requiring the highest-quality materials, monitoring and training of personnel. Critics say it's unrealistic to think they can operate flawlessly. Corrosion of vital equipment remains a potential problem, especially if it goes undetected deep within parts of the reactor that are difficult or impossible to directly inspect. 
What's more, none of the Generation III designs have been cleared for construction by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Some Generation IV concepts haven't even been presented to the NRC for review, and they still are years away from crossing that threshold. 
"The designs are safer and the safety culture is better than 20 years ago," says Tom Cochrane, senior scientist with the nuclear-analysis team of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental-advocacy group. But he's still not convinced reactors are safe enough to proceed. Critics remain concerned about possible physical breaches of security in the case of a terrorist attack. 
Some researchers see the answer to the safety problem in revolutionary reactor designs that promise to be more "inherently safe" -- physically incapable of suffering a catastrophic meltdown. One such design, at least in theory, is the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, being developed in China and South Africa. It's powered with balls of uranium-filled graphite rather than the typical fuel rods. If the cooling system were to fail, the reactor temperature stays well below the balls' melting point and then automatically cools down. 
Westinghouse is working with the Department of Energy toward the possibility of getting a design certified by the NRC by 2017 or so. China currently has a small prototype pebble-bed reactor and plans to start construction this year on a 200-megawatt plant using the technology. 
Most industry observers think the design is intriguing but faces big hurdles in this country because it uses a gas coolant, instead of water, and different fuel. The NRC would have to develop special processes for reviewing such a design because its expertise is in pressurized water or boiling water reactors. 
Exelon Corp., which operates 17 commercial reactors in the U.S., was interested in the pebble-bed reactor in the late 1990s but is no longer involved. "There were technical problems such as fuel issues that made us decide we didn't want to proceed," says Amir Shahkarami, senior vice president of nuclear generation at Exelon. 
Cutting the Cost 
While safety may be nuclear power's biggest PR problem, cost is what killed development a generation ago, ultimately determining that only half the plants licensed by the NRC got built. And nuclear plants generally face an unfortunate trade-off: making them more safe can make them more expensive. 
Makers of Generation III models are addressing the cost issue in a number of ways. For one, they claim the reactors will remain in service more years, so construction costs will be spread over a longer operating life. Today's plants are being designed to last at least 60 years -- longer than any other plants except hydroelectric dams. Existing nuclear plants were expected to be retired after 40 years, though roughly half have gotten 20-year license extensions. 
The new plants are also designed to be much simpler and quicker to build, reducing financing costs by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. For instance, there's the ABWR reactor, which has been built in Japan by GE-Hitachi and which NRG Energy Inc. hopes to build with Toshiba's help in South Texas. The reactor is built in modules, vastly speeding construction time. GE-Hitachi, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Hitachi Ltd., says it has built the plant in 42 months in Japan, which is more than twice as fast as the Generation II reactors it built in the 1980s. The company compares construction methods to putting up a modular home versus constructing a stick-built house. 
NRG hopes to build two ABWR reactors in Texas, next to its existing South Texas Project nuclear plant. Each plant will employ 190 modules, which NRG believes will cut field labor costs by 30%. Faster construction also will reduce the length of time it will have to rent a heavy crane at $400,000 a month. 
Still, nuclear plants will remain very expensive. Recent estimates put Generation III plant costs at $4,000 to $6,700 per kilowatt of capacity, or $4.4 billion to $11 billion, for plants ranging from 1,100 megawatts to 1,600 megawatts in size. In comparison, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study estimated the price of a coal plant at about $2,300 a kilowatt of capacity and a gas-fired plant at about $850 a kilowatt of capacity. 
In fact, only a handful of U.S. utilities are big enough to build Generation III reactors alone, without being part of a consortium. As a result, some see nuclear power's future in small reactors that could be manufactured in factories instead of on site -- and cost only $3,500 to $5,000 per kilowatt of capacity, or millions of dollars instead of billions. 
Babcock & Wilcox, a unit of McDermott International, has designed a small 125-megawatt reactor that would be built at its U.S. factories and then delivered to power-plant sites by rail or barge. This would eliminate a bottleneck -- and the associated higher costs -- for ultra-heavy forgings that are required for large reactors. Small reactors could be built at a number of domestic heavy-manufacturing sites. The Lynchburg, Va., company has been building small reactors and other key components for Navy ships for decades, at plants in Indiana and Ohio. 
Another plus of small reactors: They're designed to be refueled less frequently, reducing the number of refueling outages. Instead of every 18 months to two years, they could go four or five years, reaping a saving from having less down time. Another feature of some reactors is the ability to do more maintenance while plants are running, again reducing idle time. 
Babcock & Wilcox hopes to apply for certification of a design for its mPower modular reactor in 2011. It's too early to seek orders, but it's working with Exelon and the Tennessee Valley Authority on a preliminary design, to make sure it would meet the needs of utilities. It's unlikely any could be built in the U.S. before the middle of the next decade. 
Critics say there's not enough practical experience to know if any of the U.S. designs, big or small, will function as proponents say. Only one, the ABWR, has completed the review process at the NRC and completed the detailed design that would be used as the basis of actual construction. 
What's more, critics say that the economics of small plants simply don't work: The licensing costs are so great for nuclear plants, somewhere between $50 million and $100 million per site, and security and construction costs are so high that the economics work only for big plants, with lots of output, so costs can be spread over many kilowatt-hours of electricity. Proponents hope factory-like construction techniques and a wider availability of suitable sites will help them overcome that drawback. 
Producing Less Waste 
It's one of the most contentious issues surrounding nuclear power: Where do you put the spent fuel? 
Tens of thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste -- mainly spent fuel rods -- are sitting at power-plant sites while the federal government struggles to come up with a site to store it all. No nation has yet built a permanent waste site, although the current situation can continue for some time: Even critics say storage methods in place now should allow fuel to be stored safety for 50 to 100 years, while permanent plans are worked out. 
The big problem with controlling waste: Today's reactors capture only about 5% of the useful energy contained in uranium -- which means lots of radioactive leftovers once the fuel is used. Some Generation III reactors promise to address this problem by squeezing more electricity out of their fuel, reducing the total amount of waste produced, but it's only by a relatively small amount. In short, it does nothing to solve the looming waste issue, though it does produce more megawatts of electricity in the short run. 
Some Generation IV reactors, known as fast reactors, may offer a breakthrough in the future -- because they're designed to burn previously used fuel. 
GE-Hitachi, for example, is developing a fast reactor called Prism that would take spent fuel or weapons waste, sitting in storage today, and use nearly all of it as fuel, leaving little waste. What's left would also be less radioactive than current waste, and would need to be stored for hundreds of years instead of thousands of years, scientists say. Fast reactors are able to unlock energy in waste because they can burn plutonium, neptunium and other materials that Generation II and Generation III reactors leave behind. 
GE-Hitachi estimates there's enough energy sitting in nuclear storage sites in the U.S. to completely meet the nation's energy needs for 70 years, if fast reactors were used to convert waste into electricity. 
The company hopes to apply for NRC certification of its Prism design in 2011 and build a prototype reactor at an estimated cost of $3.2 billion within the next decade. The cost is enormous for a reactor that would be only 311 megawatts in size, amounting to $10,000 per kilowatt of capacity, but the company says costs for subsequent units should drop. 
Critics point out that the U.S. tried to develop fast reactors in the past, but dropped its efforts because the technical hurdles and cost appeared too great. The NRDC, in a recent report, said that fast reactors would be "expensive to build, complex to operate, susceptible to prolonged shutdowns . . . and difficult and time-consuming to repair."

Technology changes, but human nature doesn't. Environmentally friendly energy projects are running into the same cries of "not in my backyard" that stymied a previous generation of alternative-power efforts. 
Even as Americans tell pollsters they are eager for alternatives to fossil fuel, some are fighting proposals for solar and wind projects and for the thousands of miles of transmission lines that would be needed to carry the cleaner energy to market. The protests echo grass-roots opposition that has blocked nuclear plants and energy-producing trash incinerators for decades. 
The new backlash is fueled by worries that renewable-energy projects would occupy vast amounts of land to produce significant amounts of power. Either renewable projects would have to be centralized and sprawling, covering many square miles apiece, or they would need to be distributed in pieces across millions of rooftops and lawns. 
Renewable-energy projects would reduce pollution and combat climate change. The trade-off is that many more people would have to see wind turbines, solar panels and other energy infrastructure near their homes in order to diminish the need for coal mines and other fossil-fuel facilities. 
"Anywhere I walked on this property, we'd be able to view them and we'd be able to hear them," says Tina FitzGerald, who lives with her family on a 12-acre Vermont farm near where a developer has proposed erecting five wind turbines, each about 400 feet tall. "There should be a place for these -- someplace that isn't going to impact families quite so much." 
In California, which is considering a goal of producing a third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, some residents are fighting proposals to build vast solar-energy plants in the Mojave Desert, one of the most remote and reliably sunny spots in the U.S. Up and down the East Coast, meanwhile, residents are opposing plans for wind farms, fearing they will mar views and lower property values. 
Americans aren't alone in their skittishness. In the U.K., which also aims to generate about one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, local opposition is holding up proposed wind projects. Resistance in Ontario led the Canadian province to pass legislation in May establishing a framework for locating renewable-energy sites; local opponents will be able to challenge projects on environmental or safety grounds, but not for aesthetic reasons. 
In a report last year, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cited "not in my backyard" sentiment as among the top five threats to the growth of renewable energy world­wide. 
The U.S. has to make a tough choice, says Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank that supports giving the federal government more authority to push renewable-energy projects forward. That will be necessary, he says, to curb the country's dependence on foreign oil and its greenhouse-gas emissions. "You have to ask yourself: At what point do priority national interests need to override local goals?" 
The clash over whether it is more important to produce nonpolluting domestic energy or to protect environmentally valuable places poses a dilemma for some longtime activists. 
Calvin French, a 72-year-old retired high school English teacher, has belonged to the Sierra Club all his adult life. Leaders of the environmental group are working with California officials to help pick sites for big renewable-energy transmission lines as a way to combat climate change. But many club members, including Mr. French, want to protect their favorite places. 
His battlefield is the Carrizo Plain, a 460-square-mile swath of grassland about 115 miles north of Los Angeles that is traversed by the San Andreas Fault. 
The parched, rugged expanse is home to species including the endangered kit fox and the antelope-like pronghorn. It also is one of the most alluring spots for solar panels in the nation's most populous state. There is prolific sunlight. Much of the land has been subdivided into farms, meaning that acreage no longer can be defended as untouched. And there is a high-voltage line nearby, with capacity to carry solar power to the public. 
Amid local opposition, county and state officials for months have been mulling three big solar-energy projects that together would amount to some of the biggest solar arrays in the world. 
"Big things like global warming" are difficult to understand, says Mr. French. "But you can go out into a beautiful place and say, 'This needs to be protected.' That's easy to understand." 
Around the world, countries that have rolled out fossil-fuel alternatives most aggressively have used heavy-handed government action to address such sentiment. France, for example, now produces about 80% of its electricity from nuclear energy. But France's national government manages the country's nuclear-construction program, and it has pushed ahead for decades despite sometimes-heated public protests. 
Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress now are fighting over how much power the federal government should have in getting energy projects built. Many renewable-energy proponents say a massive network of new transmission wires would have to be built to bring large supplies of renewable power to population centers. A Senate committee passed a bill in June that would give the federal government authority to decide where to put new power lines if states, which now make those decisions, move too slowly. 
The drive for more federal control has the support of many executives in the electric industry, who say the new transmission lines should be available for energy from all sources, including fossil fuel. But there is plenty of opposition to giving Washington that power. Some lawmakers from densely populated states don't want big new transmission lines running through their land. Many state utility regulators also object to an increased federal push. 
Caught in the middle are states where renewable energy suddenly is big business. Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal likens his state's wind boom to the coal rush that hit Wyoming three decades ago in the wake of an energy shock. 
At a wind-energy conference in Wyoming last month, Gov. Freudenthal, a Democrat, delivered a stern warning to wind-turbine developers, telling them to make sure their projects don't harm a small bird called the sage grouse. 
"What I have is an obsession with making sure that the economy of this state continues to function, and it won't if that bird gets listed," according to his office's transcript of his remarks. 
Anything that nudges the sage grouse toward the federal government's list of endangered species, he explained, would trigger land-use restrictions that would jeopardize Wyoming's main economic engine: the production of coal, oil and natural gas. "Generally in this state, we support economic development," he told the wind developers. But "when all of a sudden it ends up in our backyard, our view changes a lot."

Abstract 
[...] in an essay posted in March on the Web site of a Tufts University think tank she leads, she wrote that unchecked greenhouse-gas emissions will yield "a record of human misery...even greater than the traumas of the Holocaust of the 1940s and the genocidal violence that exists today" as a result of deaths caused directly by "extreme weather events" and indirectly by disease, hunger, war and mass migration.\n 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The debate over how to curb carbon-dioxide emissions and other gases linked to global climate change is splitting some prominent political families in both parties. 
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is one of the Obama administration's leading advocates of strong action on climate change. His older brother John, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, voted with many House Republicans against a bill to cap U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 
John Salazar said the House climate bill would be "unfair" to Colorado and lead to "dramatically" higher electricity bills for his constituents. 
"He has his job to do; I have my job to do," said his brother, the interior secretary. 
John Podesta knows that feeling. Mr. Podesta, a White House chief of staff under President Clinton who advised President Barack Obama on his White House transition, is one of the House bill's most outspoken supporters. 
In blog posts on the Web site of the Center for American Progress, an Obama-friendly think tank, Mr. Podesta has accused "coal lobby groups" of waging "a massive campaign" to defeat the measure. 
Mr. Podesta's older brother Tony is a registered lobbyist for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. The coalition, which represents major coal producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and electric utilities such as American Electric Power Co., said the House legislation "does not adequately protect consumers and the domestic economy." 
The coalition has come under attack from the younger Mr. Podesta's group over the former's use of a subcontractor that has acknowledged sending members of Congress fake letters purporting to be from nonprofit groups opposed to climate legislation. 
"If John thinks the opposite of what I think, that's okay -- we're still having dinner on Wednesday," said Tony Podesta. He said he supports limiting carbon emissions and that his client is only trying to "shape the [climate] bill" -- not "obstruct and stop" it, as the younger Mr. Podesta's group claimed this month. 
"That's quite a bizarre route to try to get legislation passed," John Podesta said, referring to the letters. The coal coalition has publicly denounced the letters; the subcontractor blames the letters on a temporary employee it said has been dismissed. 
Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R., Calif.) voted for the House bill, saying it "sets us on an important path toward a greener, more sustainable energy future." Her husband, Rep. Connie Mack, (R., Fla.) voted against the measure, calling it "costly and burdensome legislation that would impose a national energy tax on hardworking American families and businesses." 
Both "agree, however, that varying views strengthen, rather than divide, our party," a spokeswoman for Connie Mack said. 
Another family with divided loyalties is that of Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D., W. Va.). The senator has expressed concerns about the potential impact of climate legislation on his coal-rich state, and suggested the U.S. give "short-term economic assistance" to energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries to help them defray the legislation's cost. 
But his cousin, economist Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, said it is "critical" to require industries to pay for the right to emit carbon, and that the overall economic benefits to the 
U.S. of capping carbon emissions will outweigh the costs. 
Ms. Goodwin declined an interview request. But in an essay posted in March on the Web site of a Tufts University think tank she leads, she wrote that unchecked greenhouse-gas emissions will yield "a record of human misery...even greater than the traumas of the Holocaust of the 1940s and the genocidal violence that exists today" as a result of deaths caused directly by "extreme weather events" and indirectly by disease, hunger, war and mass migration. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Rockefeller said he wasn't available for an interview. He recently joined nine other Senate Democrats in signing a letter to Mr. Obama warning that it would be "extremely difficult" to support climate legislation that doesn't include tariffs on goods from nations that don't limit greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Obama has expressed reservations about the idea, saying it would send "protectionist signals." 
The conflicting views among prominent Democrats on one of Mr. Obama's top priorities have raised eyebrows in Washington. "We'll go ahead and speculate that the Podestas' Thanksgiving dinner should be interesting," said Marianne Lavelle of the Center for Public Integrity, a government watchdog that reported on Tony Podesta's work for the coal group in July. 
Still, John and Tony Podesta say their communications about Tony Podesta's client have been limited. "Before my mother died, she made us promise we'd only talk about family, food and art, and not business or body weight," John Podesta said. "That's a pretty good rule to live by."

Abstract 
[...] electric utilities, auto makers and states get free allowances on the condition that they comply with regulations requiring coal sequestration, alternative energy sources, energy conservation, advanced auto technology and more. [...] many other provisions of the 1,428 page bill mandate outright regulation on subjects ranging from how electricity is generated to off-road vehicles and household lighting. 

Full Text 
As a candidate for president in April 2008, Barack Obama told Fox News that "a cap-and-trade system is a smarter way of controlling pollution" than "top-down" regulation. He was right. With cap and trade the market decides where and how to cut emissions. With top-down regulation, as Mr. Obama explained, regulators dictate "every single rule that a company has to abide by, which creates a lot of bureaucracy and red tape and often-times is less efficient." 
It's no wonder that the House advertises its American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (also known as the Waxman-Markey bill) as "cap and trade." And last Thursday a coalition of environmental groups and unions launched a "Made in America Jobs Tour" to sell it as a ticket to "long-term economic prosperity." But the House bill would, if passed by the Senate this autumn, fail the environment and fail the test of economic efficiency. 
Waxman-Markey is largely top-down regulation dressed in cap-and-trade clothing. It purports to set a cap on greenhouse gases, but the cap is so loose in the early years that through the use of cheap offsets the U.S. need not significantly reduce its fossil-fuel emissions until about 2025. Then the bill would require a nosedive in fossil-fuel emissions. This balloon mortgage pledge of big cuts later is unlikely to be kept. 
The top-down directives come in three forms. First, electric utilities, auto makers and states get free allowances on the condition that they comply with regulations requiring coal sequestration, alternative energy sources, energy conservation, advanced auto technology and more. Second, many other provisions of the 1,428 page bill mandate outright regulation on subjects ranging from how electricity is generated to off-road vehicles and household lighting. Third, still other provisions provide subsidies for government-chosen technology "winners" such as alternate energy sources, plug-in vehicles and weatherization of old buildings. 
Progress on most or all such fronts will be needed, but when, where and how should be decided principally by a cap-driven market, not the "red tape" that candidate Obama deplored. 
This government dictation of technology would undermine President Obama's March 19 pledge that, by addressing climate change, we would become "the world's leading exporter of renewable energy." That requires coming up with better, lower-cost technologies than the rest of the world. This won't happen if the government picks the technologies. Recall that, in the 1980s, government established the Synfuels Corporation that spent billions to produce energy alternatives and came up with nothing. More recently, government required refiners to put corn-based ethanol into gasoline on the theory that it's good for the environment. Yet we've learned that wide-scale ethanol production can do more harm than good in regard to air quality and climate change, turn wildlife habitat into corn fields, and raise food prices. 
By contrast, the cap-and-trade legislation that Congress applied to acid rain in 1990 produced big dividends for the environment and the economy. It cut the acid-rain causing emissions from power plants by 43% and saved electricity consumers billions of dollars compared to top-down regulation. 
A cap and trade can be used to tackle carbon emissions more efficiently than top-down micromanagement of technology. Indeed, cap and trade should be used to regulate major conventional pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It is not only the smarter way to regulate such pollutants, as Mr. Obama recognized, but it is also necessary because key greenhouse gases and many conventional pollutants come from the same fuel-burning processes. Systems for regulating both kinds of pollutants should work together rather than at cross purposes, as detailed in our recent report for the American Enterprise Institute: "Breaking the Logjam: Environmental Reform for the New Congress and Administration." 
Why has the House turned its back on the cap-and-trade approach? Both parties have played to their bases so that the only way for the Democrats to pass Waxman-Markey was to buy swing votes by picking among technologies such as coal sequestration to please critical constituencies. 
While the House represents constituencies, the president must keep the focus on the broad national interest. Candidate Obama's comments on cap and trade came when asked to back up his claim that he would be a "uniter" by naming "a hot-button issue where you would be willing to buck the Democratic Party line and say, 'You know what? Republicans have a better idea here?'" President Obama needs to lead on the principles on which he campaigned and the Republicans in the Senate need to listen. Otherwise, Congress will pass something like the House bill or, worse still, won't legislate at all. 
In that case, the Environmental Protection Agency would regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This would involve even more top-down control than Waxman-Markey. Regulators would be required, for example, to impose source-specific emission limits on every major new or modified source. Government would decide who cuts emissions through a complicated process that would undoubtedly produce the very red tape and inefficiency Mr. Obama warned about. Congress should instead apply to climate change the market-based solution that it successfully applied to acid rain nearly 20 years ago.

Currents -- Power Shift: Deep in the Wilderness, Power Companies Wade In --- Small Hydroelectric Dams Catch On in Remote Spots; Critics Fear Environmental Toll and See More-Efficient Options Elsewhere

Abstract 
According to the U.S. Hydropower Resource Assessment for Washington state in 1997, more than 2,500 megawatts of power could be added by simply improving efficiencies at existing hydroelectric plants and adding hydro to non-generating dams, such as those used for reservoirs or agricultural irrigation. 

Full Text 
Sultan, Wash. -- A big public utility is on the cusp of building a hydroelectric-power plant on a picture-perfect stream in the Pacific Northwest, but the plan has yet to draw the usual opposition. 
That is in part because the approved project, which involves building a dam on a tributary called Youngs Creek, is so small and remote that it has attracted little notice. It will generate only about 7.5 megawatts of power at its peak, enough electricity to power between 3,500 and 7,500 homes. By contrast, the much bigger Henry M. Jackson Hydroelectric Project on the nearby Sultan River can produce up to 112 megawatts, or enough power for 56,000 to 112,000 homes. 
So-called small hydro plants like Youngs Creek are sprouting up across the country, with around 500 potential sites identified by a federal study in Washington state alone. Power managers are seeking ways to meet the growing demand for electricity without turning to sources like coal plants that are widely thought to contribute to global warming. Generating power from streams and rivers, while often controversial, produces few emissions. 
"We're in a situation where we're doing what our customers and society want," says Steve Klein, general manager of the Snohomish County Public Utility District north of Seattle, which is spearheading Youngs Creek and plans as many as 10 more. 
But the small-hydro trend is beginning to raise eyebrows in environmental and recreation circles, especially in the West where much of the activity is taking place. The concern is that dozens, if not hundreds of dams and small power plants could industrialize vast reaches of spectacular backcountry, while providing relatively little power. Aside from ruining prized whitewater rafting runs, the projects could kill fish, critics say, whilecarving up habitat for other wildlife, such as for bears and eagles, with roads, transmission lines and other infrastructure. 
According to the U.S. Hydropower Resource Assessment for Washington state in 1997, more than 2,500 megawatts of power could be added by simply improving efficiencies at existing hydroelectric plants and adding hydro to non-generating dams, such as those used for reservoirs or agricultural irrigation. By contrast, the report estimated that developing all the state's potential hydro sites, including small ones, would add only 762 megawatts. 
"One plant here, one there, maybe we would support that," says Thomas O'Keefe, Northwest regional coordinator of American Whitewater, a rafters' group. "But with so many on the drawing board this really gets to be an issue of cumulative impacts." 
Already, about 60 small-hydro projects have been licensed over the past 10 years in British Columbia, with at least one big U.S. utility, San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Co., saying it is considering using the power to add to its portfolio. 
In Colorado, Gov. Bill Ritter's energy office is working to get "10 to 15" small-hydro projects built out of about 200 potential sites federal officials have identified in the Rocky Mountain state, says Todd Hartman, a spokesman for the office. The sites the governor's office is pushing would use existing infrastructure like dams or irrigation ditches, and so wouldn't entail as much stream disruption as other places, Mr. Hartman says. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the plants, has applications pending for about 14,000 megawatts, enough electricity for roughly seven million to 14 million homes, from mostly small-hydro projects nationwide, says Andrew Munro, president of the National Hydropower Association trade group. That is a more-than-20% increase from two years ago, he says. 
In some cases, small-hydro plants have met fierce resistance. In 2008, a clean-energy company called Principle Power Hydro of San Francisco unveiled plans for nine small-hydro plants along a 34-mile stretch of Oregon's McKenzie River that would generate a combined 83 megawatts of power. But environmentalists and recreation enthusiasts complained the hydro plants would despoil a popular whitewater river in Oregon, and FERC officials ended up denying the company's request for a preliminary permit. 
And in Montana, American Whitewater has joined some other groups in protesting plans by Hydrodynamics Inc. to build a small-hydro plant on the famed Madison River outside Yellowstone National Park. The groups say diversion of water for the plant would harm fish and other wildlife on the river. Ben Singer, project engineer for the Bozeman, Mont., builder of small-hydro plants, says the company believes it can design a project that would have no impact. Federal officials are still considering the company's request for preliminary permit to explore building a plant there. 
But often, plants like Youngs Creek are meeting little, if any, opposition in part because of their sheer remoteness. Youngs Creek, the place where the Snohomish utility wants to build a small-hydro plant, is situated in the Cascades foothills about five miles from the nearest town. Like most similar projects being considered, this would be built above where salmon and other threatened migratory fish go, and so can't be challenged on those grounds. The utility purchased property and rights for the hydro facility in 2008 for $745,000 from a private firm. 
"We decided not to oppose Youngs Creek because we couldn't find anyone who really used it, and it would just take too much of our resources for such a small project," says Rich Bowers, Northwest coordinator of the Hydropower Reform Coalition, which represents about 140 environmental, recreation and other groups. 
But Mr. Bowers added he still questions the viability of the project, which utility officials say is expected to cost $30 million and be completed in 2011 after a construction bid is issued in a few weeks. The project originally had been issued a federal license 20 years ago, but wasn't built then because the market for alternative energy projects generally foundered after oil prices declined. FERC officials reauthorized the project in February. 
One issue these plants face, Mr. Bowers says, is that the creeks they depend on are often seasonal, with sharply reduced flows in late summer. 
Snohomish officials say that when flows are low, they won't be generating electricity from the plant. Although the utility, like many around the West, is drawing ever more power from wind farms, they say creeks and small rivers are an important backup source much of the year. 
"We have a lot of wind, but the problem is when it turns off," says Barry Chrisman, plant superintendent of the Jackson Hydroelectric Project, where officials plan to remotely control both Youngs Creek and another small-hydro plant, Woods Creek. The utility bought that existing 500,000-kilowatt plant from a private company for $1.1 million in 2008. "That's why low-impact hydro is important, to pick up the slack."

Abstract

Full Text 
CANBERRA -- Australia approved a mandate to use more renewable energy but set aside a debate over capping its greenhouse-gas emissions, signaling the tensions that face governments around the world in tackling climate change. 
Lawmakers Thursday approved legislation that would require 20% of Australia's electricity generation to come from renewable sources by 2020. 
The passage follows a move by the government to separate its renewable-energy program from a plan to place a mandatory cap on greenhouse-gas emissions, which was rejected by the Senate last week. 
The wrangling Down Under mirrors divisions in the U.S. and around the world over how to move to cleaner energy systems. 
Fossil-fuel use and greenhouse-gas emissions are growing world-wide. Yet many scientists say deep emissions cuts will be necessary by midcentury to prevent the most dangerous consequences of global warming. Getting from here to there would require a massive economic shift. 
In Australia, both major parties claimed victory for the success of the renewable program, which fulfills part of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2007 election pledge to make the economy greener. A tougher task lies ahead: The Rudd administration has vowed to reintroduce its greenhouse-gas plan this year. 
The main opposition Liberal-National coalition remains divided over that plan, which would see Australia introduce a cap-and-trade system similar to one operating in Europe since 2005. The system would cap Australia's carbon-dioxide emissions, forcing heavy polluters, such as power generators and aluminum and cement makers, to buy so-called carbon permits to account for their emissions. 
Significantly curbing emissions would require either shifting to other energy sources or figuring out how to burn coal more cleanly. Mandatory cap-and-trade programs would force companies to pay for the right to emit greenhouse gases. Proponents say the programs, by raising the cost of burning fossil fuel, would encourage cleaner alternatives. Opponents say they would cost too much.

Abstract 
Th gas-industry's goals in the Senate include incentives that will encourage power companies to switch to natural gas from coal and lead truck fleets to convert to natural gas from diesel. 

Full Text 
The U.S. natural-gas industry, disappointed by the climate-change bill passed by the House of Representatives in June, is counting on new Democratic allies and a stepped-up 

lobbying campaign to push measures through the Senate that will favor gas over coal and oil. 
The climate-change debate in the Senate, which is expected to involve several committees after Labor Day, comes at a critical time for the gas industry. It faces a glut that has 
driven natural-gas prices below $3.20 per million British thermal units, their lowest level since 2002. In addition, huge new gas discoveries in Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and 
elsewhere have produced a surge in supply. 

The House bill, known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act, focuses on "clean coal" research rather than encouraging natural-gas use. Many in the gas industry 
concede they were caught off guard by both the coal industry's intensive lobbying campaign and the speed with which the House acted. 

"We were not prepared for the pace at which the House legislation proceeded," says Jim Hackett, chairman and chief executive of gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp. 
But Mr. Hackett says the industry won't repeat its mistake with the Senate. He and other CEOs have formed a new lobbying group, America's Natural Gas Alliance, and pledged 
about $80 million to the effort, which will include a national media campaign in the fall. 

The alliance's members include more than two dozen of the top natural-gas producers in the U.S., including Chesapeake Energy Corp., XTO Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp. 

David Trice, who is chairman of both the Alliance and gas producer Newfield Exploration Co., stepped down as Newfield's CEO in May in part to focus on the lobbying effort. He 
says he has met with 20 senators since the group was formed in March. 
Th gas-industry's goals in the Senate include incentives that will encourage power companies to switch to natural gas from coal and lead truck fleets to convert to natural gas 

from diesel. Lobbyists will also seek to limit companies' ability to atone for their pollution via carbon "offsets," such as planting trees overseas, which reduce the incentive to 

switch to cleaner fuels like gas. 
At a recent conference on clean energy in Las Vegas, former Vice President Al Gore, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Energy Secretary Steven Chu all spoke positively 
about using more natural gas. 

Following the conference, John Podesta, who co-led President Barack Obama's transition team last winter and who heads the liberal Center for American Progress, co-wrote a 

paper with former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth advocating greater use of natural gas. 
Environmental groups are also pushing the Senate to embrace natural gas as a "bridge fuel," which would allow the U.S. to move away from coal and oil faster than it could 
using renewable fuels alone. 

"I think people are realizing that instead of gas being an afterthought, gas is a balance wheel of the new market," says Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, an 

environmental group. 
But the gas industry must overcome major hurdles. Other energy producers are also mobilizing. A major theme of the coal industry has been the relatively stable price of coal 
compared with volatile natural-gas prices. Meanwhile, major natural-gas consumers, including chemical companies and many utilities, oppose increased use of natural gas 
because it could drive up costs. 

Mr. Trice concedes that the industry was slow to recognize the need to persuade lawmakers that the U.S. can burn more gas without causing price spikes because of the new 
gas discoveries. 
"We weren't up there telling them how things have changed over the last couple years," Mr. Trice says. 
"It would've been nice if this organization existed a year ago," he adds. "But we're part of the debate today."

Abstract 
Forest cover accounts for more than 20% of India's land, and it neutralizes more than 11% of India's total greenhouse-gas emissions at 1994 levels -- equivalent to 100% of emissions from all energy in the residential and transport sectors, or 40% of total emissions from the agriculture sector, the report said. 

Full Text 
NEW DELHI -- India has established one of the world's largest forest-protection funds and plans to set up a regulatory body modeled on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to improve its dismal environmental track record. The move comes even as the country resists firm caps on carbon emissions. 
The $2.5 billion fund will be earmarked for the regeneration and management of forests, which have been identified by researchers as an important means of reducing carbon emissions, said Jairam Ramesh, India's minister of state for environment and forests, on Thursday. An additional $1 billion in public funds will be allocated for "forestry-related activities," according to a new report from the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests. 
Forest cover accounts for more than 20% of India's land, and it neutralizes more than 11% of India's total greenhouse-gas emissions at 1994 levels -- equivalent to 100% of emissions from all energy in the residential and transport sectors, or 40% of total emissions from the agriculture sector, the report said. 
India has been making a concerted effort in the area of forestry for 20 years, and is one of the few developing countries where the forest cover has increased over that period, according to Mr. Ramesh. 
At the same time, he acknowledged that climate change is of real and growing concern -- especially for India's economy. India is the world's fourth-largest emitter of carbon. 
"In the last 60 years, 45% of the variation in our GDP growth has been because of variations in rainfall," he said. "We are therefore acutely conscious of what will happen to different parts of India because of climate change." 
Mr. Ramesh reiterated India's longstanding position that the nation wouldn't accept emissions caps because that would limit economic growth, and that developed countries, which have much higher cumulative emissions, should take a more appropriate share of the responsibility. The U.S., for example, produces 20.9% of global carbon emissions, according to the 2007 Human Development Report put out by the United Nations Development Program. 
He was also adamant that India wouldn't cut back on its consumption of coal, a big source of carbon emissions. "We have the third-largest reserve of coal," Mr. Ramesh said. "It would be foolish of us to give up on that option." Building a nuclear plant takes seven to 10 years, he pointed out.

Full Text 
In the 1960s, a University of Wisconsin graduate student named Thomas Crocker came up with a novel solution for environmental problems: cap emissions of pollutants and then let firms trade permits that allow them to pollute within those limits. 
Now legislation using cap-and-trade to limit greenhouse gases is working its way through Congress and could become the law of the land. But Mr. Crocker and other pioneers of the concept are doubtful about its chances of success. They aren't abandoning efforts to curb emissions. But they are tiptoeing away from an idea they devised decades ago, doubting it can work on the grand scale now envisioned. 
"I'm skeptical that cap-and-trade is the most effective way to go about regulating carbon," says Mr. Crocker, 73 years old, a retired economist in Centennial, Wyo. He says he prefers an outright tax on emissions because it would be easier to enforce and provide needed flexibility to deal with the problem. 
The House has passed cap-and-trade legislation. The Senate could take up a measure in September. But Republicans strongly oppose the idea -- arguing that it is a tax that will hurt the economy -- and Democrats are struggling to come up with an approach that apportions the inevitable cost of a cap-and-trade system among different interests, from consumers to utilities to coal plants. 
Mr. Crocker, who went on to become a professor at the University of Wyoming, is one of two economists who dreamed up cap-and-trade in the 1960s. The other, John Dales, who died in 2007, was also a skeptic of using the idea to tame global warning. 
"It isn't a cure-all for everything," Mr. Dales said in an interview in 2001. "There are lots of situations that don't apply." 
Mr. Crocker sees two modern-day problems in using a cap-and-trade system to address the global greenhouse-gas issue. The first is that carbon emissions are a global problem with myriad sources. Cap-and-trade, he says, is better suited for discrete, local pollution problems. "It is not clear to me how you would enforce a permit system internationally," he says. "There are no institutions right now that have that power." 
Europe has embraced cap-and-trade rules. Emissions initially rose there because industries were given more permits than they needed, and regulators have since tightened the caps. Meanwhile China, India and other developing markets are reluctant to go along, fearing limits would curb their growth. If they don't participate, there is little assurance that global carbon emissions will slow much even if the U.S. goes forward with its own plan. And even if everyone signs up, Mr. Crocker says, it isn't clear the limits will be properly enforced across nations and industries. 
The other problem, Mr. Crocker says, is that quantifying the economic damage of climate change -- from floods to failing crops -- is fraught with uncertainty. One estimate puts it at anywhere between 5% and 20% of global gross domestic product. Without knowing how costly climate change is, nobody knows how tight a grip to put on emissions. 
In this case, he says Washington needs to come up with an approach that will be flexible and easy to adjust over a long stretch of time as more becomes known about damages from greenhouse-gas emissions. Mr. Crocker says cap-and-trade is better suited for problems where the damages are clear -- like acid rain in the 1990s -- and a hard limit is needed quickly. 
"Once a cap is in place," he warns, "it is very difficult to adjust." For example, buyers of emissions permits would see their value reduced if the government decided in the future to loosen the caps. 
Joseph Aldy, a White House adviser on the environment, calls the argument a "straw man," saying a market-based cap is being designed with built-in flexibility. For example, a price ceiling on carbon allowances could prevent the program from becoming too big a burden on households and businesses and a floor would prevent a big loss in the value of permits. And unlike a tax, he says, a cap ensures carbon reduction. 
Pollution has been a puzzle for economists for decades. In the early 1900s, a British economist named Arthur Pigou proposed taxes on polluters. Ronald Coase, a University of Chicago economist, won a Nobel Prize for his 1960 book, "The Problem of Social Cost," which showed how market economics could address pollution problems. 
In 1966, Mr. Crocker, still struggling to finish his thesis at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, sketched out the cap-and-trade idea to deal with air pollution produced by fertilizer plants in Florida. Mr. Crocker first pitched the idea of trading at a conference in Washington. He had been asked to attend as a stand-in for a professor who couldn't go and present data on the Florida plants. He didn't have all the data yet and came up with the theory instead. 
Working separately, Mr. Dales in 1968 published a book called, "Pollution, Property and Prices," which used the same approach for farmers who were polluting Canadian lakes and streams. 
Their logic went like this: When governments capped smog emissions from power plants or the runoff of pesticides by farmers into local streams, it was indirectly putting a value on these emissions. Some farmers and some power plants could reduce these emissions more efficiently than others, and some placed a higher value on them than others. By setting caps on pollution but then allowing the polluters to trade these rights, the economists theorized, the polluters themselves would figure out the cheapest way to meet new targets. 
Another economist, David Montgomery, advanced their ideas in the 1970s, converting their theories into the complex mathematical formulas to demonstrate that they weren't merely an idea but were also economically feasible. Mr. Montgomery, too, is a skeptic of cap-and-trade for greenhouse gases. He prefers an outright tax. 
"You get huge swings in carbon prices with a cap, which creates more volatility and uncertainty for business," he says. 
Cap-and-trade got a big boost in 1990, when President George H.W. Bush signed amendments to the Clean Air Act that imposed new limits on emissions of sulfur dioxide, which produces acid rain. Economists said the move let producers save billions of dollars and still hit their targets. 
Still, Messrs. Dales and Crocker never got much personal mileage out of the idea. Mr. Crocker says he had such a hard time getting funding to further his research on the subject that he moved on to other matters. So far, he has stayed on the sidelines in the debate about cap-and-trade.

Abstract 
[...] their demand that "a longer-term border adjustment mechanism" -- a euphemism for tariffs -- "is a vital part of this package to prevent the relocation of carbon emissions and industries" to countries that aren't as foolish as to impose a similar tax. 

Full Text 
President Obama says his cap-and-trade energy tax won't hurt the economy, but at least 10 Senate Democrats disagree. Last week they sent Mr. Obama a letter demanding that any bill taxing U.S. CO2 emissions must include a carbon tariff "to ensure that manufacturers do not bear the brunt of our climate change policy." 
Hmmm. This sure sounds like an explicit admission that cap and tax would add so much to the cost of doing business in the U.S. that it would drive factories and jobs overseas. The 10 mostly liberal Senators come from states like Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia whose economies rely heavily on manufacturing and coal. "We must not engage in a self-defeating effort that displaces greenhouse gas emissions rather than reducing them and displaces U.S. jobs rather than bolstering them," wrote the Senators. 
Thus their demand that "a longer-term border adjustment mechanism" -- a euphemism for tariffs -- "is a vital part of this package to prevent the relocation of carbon emissions and industries" to countries that aren't as foolish as to impose a similar tax. Those countries include China and India, which have told Obama officials that they have no intention of signing on to the rich world's growth-killing obsessions. 
All of which puts the President in an economic policy bind. When the House passed its cap-and-tax bill in June, he warned against a carbon tariff by saying "I think we need to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals." But these 10 Senate Democrats are saying explicitly that protectionism is the price of their support. So Mr. Obama can opt to impose a huge carbon tax and drive jobs overseas, or he can impose the tax along with a tariff, and kick off a trade war. Better to call the whole thing off.

Abstract 
Among their concerns: Because the country has so much cheap coal, any switch to cleaner-burning fuels will likely drive up the cost of electricity and threaten energy-dependent industries, including the country's powerful natural-resources sector. 

Full Text 
CANBERRA, Australia -- Lawmakers are expected to reject legislation aimed at capping greenhouse-gas emissions in Australia this week in a move that could imperil one of the country's most important economic initiatives in recent years. 
The debate is shaping up as the biggest test yet of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's nearly two years in office, and could result in a call for early elections if he can't get key conservative lawmakers on his side. It could also provide a case study for similar debates in the U.S., where lawmakers are wrangling over a similar plan to set mandatory caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. 
That policy is set to be debated by the U.S. Senate next month after it passed the House of Representatives by a slim 219-212 margin in June. 
Like the U.S. plan, Australia's climate bill has been criticized by green groups for its relatively weak carbon-emission reduction targets and generous industry allowances, which many argue could make it ineffective. 
At the same time, representatives from industry have argued Australia's plan goes too far, threatening jobs and adding new costs for consumers and businesses at a time when the economy is just recovering from a global recession. 
Analysts are watching Australia's effort closely. Although Australia accounts for only around 1.5% of global greenhouse emissions, it is the biggest per-capita carbon polluter in the developed world due to its reliance on fossil fuels, mainly coal, for around 80% of its electricity generation. Clean-air advocates say they believe countries such as Australia and the U.S. need to set a better example before other parts of the world agree to curb their worsening pollution problems. 
Australia's planned carbon-trading program is similar to a European Union one in place since 2005. It would cap Australia's carbon-dioxide emissions, forcing heavy polluters like power generators and aluminum and cement makers to buy so-called carbon permits to account for their emissions. 
To ease criticism from industry, it would allocate 27% of the carbon permits free in the first year to heavy-polluting companies that are highly exposed to international trade. It also sets a relatively low target for overall emission reductions, with a goal of cutting emissions in the country by 5% from 2000 levels by 2020, though it could go higher under certain circumstances. 
By comparison, the U.S. plan calls for cuts to U.S. emissions of 17% from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% by 2050. Japan, a global manufacturing hub for automobiles and electronics, aims to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. The EU has agreed to reductions of at least 20% on 1990 levels by 2020, and will cut by as much as 30% if other developed countries make comparable efforts. 
Conservative senators in Australia have nevertheless vowed to kill the program during a vote in the Senate on Thursday if further changes aren't made. Among their concerns: Because the country has so much cheap coal, any switch to cleaner-burning fuels will likely drive up the cost of electricity and threaten energy-dependent industries, including the country's powerful natural-resources sector. 
Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull has offered to deliver enough conservative votes to pass the legislation, but only if the government agrees to certain conditions. Among other things, he and others want emissions from coal mining and agriculture to be excluded from the proposal. They also have called on the government to delay the design of the Australian carbon program until February or March, after the U.S. Senate has debated its climate bill. 
Because Australia's center-left Labor government lacks a majority in the Senate, where laws are passed, it needs the support of conservatives -- or other smaller parties that also have concerns about the program -- to pass its plan. 
If the vote fails, the government would still be able to revive some form of climate program in future months. But it would likely to have agree to further concessions to win enough support from conservatives.

Abstract 
Duke Energy's agreement with Huaneng, China's biggest power producer by capacity, comes as the U.S. government presses China to do more to slow the growth of its greenhouse-gas emissions and to establish peak emitting years so Washington can consider signing on to an international climate accord.

BEIJING -- Duke Energy Corp. said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with China Huaneng Group to develop technology for clean coal and for the capture and storage greenhouse gases. 
"What we'd like to do with them eventually, at the right time, is to introduce opportunities for them to invest in the U.S. as well as in South America," said Jim Rogers, Duke's chief executive, in an interview. 
Duke Energy's agreement with Huaneng, China's biggest power producer by capacity, comes as the U.S. government presses China to do more to slow the growth of its greenhouse-gas emissions and to establish peak emitting years so Washington can consider signing on to an international climate accord. 
In July, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu signed a nonbinding, preliminary agreement with China to cooperate on climate change and clean-energy policies. That created a forum for them to negotiate an accord on climate policy ahead of a global summit in Copenhagen later this year. 
China relies on coal for two-thirds of its electricity needs, and is adding close to 100 gigawatts of new capacity each year, equivalent to the entire generating capacity of the U.K. or France. 
China, the world's second-largest energy consumer after the U.S., is also targeting a sharp jump in renewable energy, especially wind power. Under a long-term plan issued in November 2007, China's National Development and Reform Commission wants renewable energy to account for 15% of the country's energy mix by 2020. 
Duke Energy and Huaneng will cooperate on the development of so-called integrated gasification combined cycle systems, which are attractive to companies such as Huaneng with coal-intensive power portfolios, as they keep coal at the forefront of new power generation initiatives. 
These plants heat coal to produce a synthetic gas, which turns a turbine to generate electricity. They typically produce about 20% less carbon dioxide than conventional pulverized coal plants, which burn coal to boil water and create steam. IGCC is also referred to as coal gasification. 
In addition, Duke and Huaneng pledged in their memorandum of understanding to cooperate on carbon capture and storage, which has the potential to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by trapping them underground. 
Duke, one of America's largest power companies with a market value of about $20 billion, is building a 630-megawatt IGCC plant in Indiana, which may become one of the first commercial demonstrations of an IGCC plant in the U.S. with carbon capture and storage. 
Huaneng is working on similar technologies as leader of the GreenGen Co. consortium, which is building China's first commercial-scale IGCC power plant in the northern city of Tianjin.

Abstract 
According to Mr. Annan's report, climate change-induced disasters now account for 315,000 deaths each year and $125 billion in damages, numbers set to rise to 500,000 deaths and $340 billion in damages by 2030. The real source of China's pollution problem is a state-led industrial policy geared toward production, and state-owned enterprises (especially in "dirty" sectors like coal and steel) that strive to meet production quotas, and state-appointed managers who don't mind cutting corners in matters of safety or environmental responsibility, and typically have the political clout to insulate themselves from any public fallout. 

Full Text 
A funny thing happened on the way to saving the world's poor from the ravages of global warming. The poor told the warming alarmists to get lost. 
This spring, the Geneva-based Global Humanitarian Forum, led by former U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan, issued a report warning that "mass starvation, mass migration, and mass sickness" would ensue if the world did not agree to "the most ambitious international agreement ever negotiated" on global warming at a forthcoming conference in Copenhagen. 
According to Mr. Annan's report, climate change-induced disasters now account for 315,000 deaths each year and $125 billion in damages, numbers set to rise to 500,000 deaths and $340 billion in damages by 2030. The numbers are hotly contested by University of Colorado disaster-trends expert Roger Pielke Jr., who calls them a "poster child for how to lie with statistics." 
But never mind about that. The more interesting kiss-off took place in New Delhi late last month, when Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told visiting Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that there was no way India would sign on to any global scheme to cap carbon emissions. 
"There is simply no case for the pressure that we, who have among the lowest emissions per capita, face to actually reduce emissions," Mr. Ramesh told Mrs. Clinton. "And as if this pressure was not enough, we also face the threat of carbon tariffs on our exports to countries such as yours." The Chinese -- the world's largest emitter of CO2 -- have told the Obama administration essentially the same thing. 
Roughly 75% of Indians -- some 800 million people -- live on $2 a day or less, adjusted for purchasing power parity. In China, it's about 36%, or about 480 million. That means the two governments alone are responsible for one in every two people living at that income level. 
If climate change is the threat Mr. Annan claims it is, India and China ought to be eagerly beating the path to Copenhagen. So why aren't they? 
To listen to the climate alarmists, it's all America's fault. "What the Chinese are chiefly guilty of is emulating the American economic model," wrote environmental writer Jacques Leslie last year in the Christian Science Monitor. "The United States passed up the opportunity it had at the beginning of China's economic transformation to guide it toward sustainability, and the loss is already incalculable." 
Facts tell a different story. When Deng Xiaoping began introducing elements of a market economy in 1980, Chinese life expectancy at birth was 65.3 years. Today it is about 73 years. The numbers are probably a bit inflated, as most numbers are in the People's Republic, but the trend line is undeniable. In India, life expectancy rose from 52.5 years in 1980 to about 67 years today. If this is the consequence of following the "American economic model" then poor countries need more of it. 
But what about all the pollution in India and particularly China? In Mr. Leslie's telling, CO2 emissions are part-and-parcel with common pollutants such as particulate matter, toxic waste, and everything else typically associated with a degraded environment. They're not. The U.S. and China produce equivalent quantities of carbon dioxide. But try naming a U.S. city whose air quality is even remotely as bad as Beijing's, or an American river as polluted as the Han: You can't. America, the richer and more industrialized country, is also by far the cleaner one. 
People who live in Third-World countries -- like Mexico, where I grew up -- tend to understand this, even if First-World environmentalists do not. People who live in oppressive Third World countries, like China, also understand that it isn't just greater wealth that leads to a better environment, but greater freedom, too. 
To return to Mr. Leslie, his complaint with China is that it has become too much of a consumer society, again in the American mold. Again he is ridiculous: China has one of the world's highest personal savings rates -- 50% versus the U.S.'s 2.7%. The real source of China's pollution problem is a state-led industrial policy geared toward production, and state-owned enterprises (especially in "dirty" sectors like coal and steel) that strive to meet production quotas, and state-appointed managers who don't mind cutting corners in matters of safety or environmental responsibility, and typically have the political clout to insulate themselves from any public fallout. 
In other words, China's pollution problems are not a function of laissez-faire policies and rampant consumerism, but of the regime's excessive lingering control of the economy. A freer China means a cleaner China. 
There's a lesson in this for those who believe that the world's environmental problems call for a new era of dirigisme. And there ought to be a lesson for those who claim to understand the problems of the poor better than the poor themselves. If global warming really is the catastrophe the alarmists claim, the least they can do for its victims is not to patronize them while impoverishing them in the bargain.

Currents: A New Fight Over Pollution Curbs Takes Root --- Energy-Intensive Companies Hope to Counter Emissions by Preserving Trees That Might Not Have Been at Risk of Destruction

Abstract 
[...] they want to harness photosynthesis for the benefit of their bottom line. [...] he says, climate change is a serious problem, and it requires us to spend serious resources. 

Full Text 
Truckee, Calif. -- How much pollution can a tree absorb? The question is at the center of a high-stakes fight over how much it will cost to curb climate change -- and who will foot the bill. 
Trees are nature's antidote to smokestacks and tailpipes. Factories and cars cough out carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas produced when fossil fuel is burned. Trees inhale it. They store the carbon in their roots, trunks and leaves, and they send the oxygen back into the air. 
But when a tree is destroyed, its carbon wafts back up into the atmosphere. Globally, according to the United Nations, nearly 20% of man-made greenhouse-gas emissions come from deforestation: trees cut and burned by humans, or mowed down by forest fire, or rotted away by disease. That is more carbon dioxide than comes from all the world's cars, trucks, planes, trains and ships, combined. 
Now, some of the world's biggest polluters are turning into tree-huggers. Facing impending government orders to help curb climate change, energy-intensive companies argue that if they help prevent a forest from being destroyed, they will be keeping carbon dioxide out of the air. So they are proposing that they pay forest owners to keep their trees alive, and in exchange they receive carbon credits that reduce their obligation to make costlier emission cuts at their own factories. In short, they want to harness photosynthesis for the benefit of their bottom line. 
It is relatively easy to measure how much carbon dioxide trees soak up. But there are major questions about claiming an existing forest as environmental cover for, say, building a new coal-burning power plant or producing a fleet of SUVs. 
These quandaries are popping up wherever there are sizable woods -- from developing countries with vast tropical rainforests, like Brazil and Indonesia, to sylvan spots like the ski-resort town of Truckee, near Lake Tahoe in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. 
Preserving forests is just one tactic raising concern that the campaign against climate change is being gamed. Landfills across the U.S. are selling carbon credits -- essentially rights to pollute -- in exchange for capturing a greenhouse gas produced by their rotting trash, even though many landfills installed the gas-capture systems years ago. 
"You've got all these folks lined up around the idea that we want to generate as many of these credits as possible so we can continue to pretend that regulating emissions is going to be cheap and easy," says David Victor, a professor of international relations at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the carbon market. In fact, he says, climate change "is a serious problem, and it requires us to spend serious resources. Right now, no one is willing to do that." 
Carbon credits should have strong environmental safeguards, says Bruce Braine, a vice president for American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio. The utility is a member of a consortium of big greenhouse-gas emitters and environmentalists advocating the use of carbon credits for forests in developing countries, where much of the debate over pollution is likely to play out. But he adds: "If you try to get it to absolutely perfect environmental integrity, you will never get anything done." 
One issue is how to prove a tree really would have been cut down were it not for the sale of a carbon credit. If the tree would have remained standing, then any carbon credit attributed to it wouldn't be providing a new environmental benefit, even though its buyer would be able to put more carbon dioxide into the air. 
Another question is how to ensure that a tree that spawns carbon credits isn't later destroyed anyway. If a tree claimed as a source of carbon credits were cut down even a few decades later, then the carbon credits it had produced would be environmentally worthless. 
In Truckee, many people who own vacation houses arrive by private plane at the town's small airport. Along the aerial approach sits a 1,500-acre forest filled with Jeffrey and Ponderosa pines. After a developer proposed building houses there, the airport district joined with governmental agencies and environmental groups two years ago to buy the forest, and signed a pledge never to develop the land. 
The goal, says David Gotschall, the airport's general manager, had nothing to do with fighting climate change. It was to avoid a wave of new homeowners who might gripe about airplane noise. 
Coincidentally, though, predictions were mounting that the U.S. government soon would regulate greenhouse-gas emissions and would let companies comply in part by buying carbon credits from trees. To encourage companies to start preparing for the regulations, environmentally aggressive California was setting up a market to promote a voluntary carbon-credit trade. 
Figuring that market might provide some extra cash, the airport's managers began the process of getting the Truckee forest sanctioned as a source of carbon credits that could be sold to companies seeking to offset their pollution. 
Last year, the airport hired a forester to measure how much carbon dioxide the woods had stored up. Under the carbon market's rules, forest owners get credits only for protecting the portion of a forest they can claim would have been destroyed. The airport estimates that preserving the forest instead of cutting down trees and building houses will keep about 226,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere over 100 years. That is the number of carbon credits the airport has proposed selling. 
What is much harder to calculate is whether awarding carbon credits for the forest helps combat climate change. 
For one, the airport would have bought and preserved the land even without the revenue from carbon credits, says Mr. Gotschall. 
Also, it isn't certain that the developer actually would have built houses in the forest if the airport hadn't bought and preserved the land. Not long after the airport took ownership of the forest, the economy tanked, bringing a lot of new home construction to a halt. 
And even if the developers had decided to go ahead with building the homes, it isn't clear how much of the forest would have been chopped down. 
"This whole industry is a lot of could-be's and what-if's," Hardy Bullock, the airport official in charge of the details, said on a recent morning. 
Answers to the what-if's will depend on what the government decides to do about greenhouse-gas emissions. Could an airport -- even one that owns a forest -- be held liable for the carbon dioxide emitted by the planes landing and taking off there? "I'll wait for Washington to answer that one," Mr. Gotschall says in the airport's terminal, a few minutes after a Gulfstream G5 jet takes off outside. A G5 burns 2,322 pounds of fuel, emitting about 3.3 tons of carbon dioxide, in an hour of typical flying. Compensating for that requires protecting about 740 square feet of Truckee forest from the buzz saw for a century.

Abstract

After years of snubbing alternative fuels as a bad investment, global energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp. said Tuesday it will sink $600 million into researching how to turn algae into a biofuel that would also help fight global warming. 
Exxon's partner in the biofuels effort will be groundbreaking genomics scientist J. Craig Venter and his company Synthetic Genomics Inc. The companies will attempt to develop algae strains that excel at both sucking up greenhouse gases and secreting oil that can be fed into refineries alongside conventional crude oil. 
If the companies are successful in developing cost-competitive barrels of algae-based oil on a large scale, the Texas energy company said it could invest billions of additional dollars to build production facilities in the future. 
Exxon's embrace of biofuels represents a strategic turnaround for one of the world's biggest refiners of transportation fuel. Exxon grew into the world's largest publicly traded company by extracting fossil fuels from the earth and converting them into gasoline, diesel and chemicals. But as global supplies of oil become harder to find and growing concerns about greenhouse-gas emissions inspire new attempts at government regulation, the concept of domestically produced oil derived from algae has become an alluring enough prospect to catch Exxon's interest. 
Mr. Venter, a well-known biologist who led an effort to map the human genome, said the leap into algae-based fuels wasn't going to be easy: "The challenges are not minor for any of us, but I think we have the combined teams, scientific and engineering talents, to give this the best chance of success." 
The two companies said they would like to use genetic engineering to develop algae strains that consume significant amounts of carbon dioxide, a gas produced by fossil-fuel use that is contributing to climate change. 
Exxon's head of research, Emil Jacobs, said it was possible the algae farms would be located near power plants and other industrial complexes to use the carbon dioxide generated in those places as feedstocks for the algae. 
Algae farms could produce two streams of income for the venture: one from selling barrels of algae oil to refineries and the other from capturing and reusing carbon dioxide. "It is reasonable to say you have to look at all commercial elements," said Exxon spokesman Rob Young. 
Greg Singleton, a senior analyst with Point Carbon, an energy and environment market-analysis firm, cited industry findings that 40% of carbon-dioxide emissions from a coal-fired power plant could be reused, but it would require an enormous 13.1-square-mile algae farm. "On paper it looks attractive," he said, but cautioned, "I haven't seen it done on a large scale." 
The U.S. Senate is set to soon take up the Waxman-Markey energy bill, which would cap greenhouse-gas emissions and allow companies to sell credits for any emissions savings they produce. Though it isn't clear how the proposed law would treat a carbon-munching algae farm, said Mr. Singleton, "In a carbon-constrained environment, it is something that could be very profitable for Exxon in the long run." 
Executives stressed that the partnership will be focused on research, and it could take up to a decade to produce commercial quantities of fuel from algae. 
Exxon's investment follows years of criticism from environmentalists and some shareholders for the company's reluctance to invest significantly in renewable energy. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson once dismissed the future of biofuels by quipping that he expected to be driven to his funeral in a hearse using gasoline or diesel.

President Obama is calling the climate bill that the House passed last week an "extraordinary" achievement, and so it is. The 1,200-page wonder manages the supreme feat of being both hugely expensive while doing almost nothing to reduce carbon emissions. 
The Washington press corps is playing the bill's 219-212 passage as a political triumph, even though one of five Democrats voted against it. The real story is what Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House baron Henry Waxman and the President himself had to concede to secure even that eyelash margin among the House's liberal majority. Not even Tom DeLay would have imagined the extravaganza of log-rolling, vote-buying, outright corporate bribes, side deals, subsidies and policy loopholes. Every green goal, even taken on its own terms, was watered down or given up for the sake of political rents. 
Begin with the supposed point of the exercise -- i.e., creating an artificial scarcity of carbon in the name of climate change. The House trimmed Mr. Obama's favored 25% reduction by 2020 to 17% in order to win over Democrats leery of imposing a huge upfront tax on their constituents; then they raised the reduction to 83% in the out-years to placate the greens. Even that 17% is not binding, since it would be largely reached with so-called offsets, through which some businesses subsidize others to make emissions reductions that probably would have happened anyway. 
Even if the law works as intended, over the next decade or two real U.S. greenhouse emissions might be reduced by 2% compared to business as usual. However, consumers would still face higher prices for electric power, transportation and most goods and services as this inefficient and indirect tax flowed down the energy chain. 
The sound bite is that this policy would only cost households "a postage stamp a day." But that's true only as long as the program doesn't really cut emissions. The goal here is to tell voters they'll pay nothing in order to get the cap-and-tax bureaucracy in place -- even though the whole idea is to raise prices to change American behavior. At the same time -- wink, wink -- Democrats tell the greens they can tighten the emissions vise gradually over time. 
Meanwhile, Congress had to bribe every business or interest that could afford a competent lobbyist. Carbon permits are valuable, yet the House says only 28% of the allowances would be auctioned off; the rest would be given away. In March, White House budget director Peter Orszag told Congress that "If you didn't auction the permit, it would represent the largest corporate welfare program that has ever been enacted in the history of the United States." 
Naturally, Democrats did exactly that. To avoid windfall profits, they then chose to control prices, asking state regulators to require utilities to use the free permits to insulate ratepayers from price increases. (This also obviates the anticarbon incentives, but never mind.) Auctions would reduce political favoritism and interference, as well as provide revenue to cut taxes to offset higher energy costs. But auctions don't buy votes. 
Then there was the peace treaty signed with Agriculture Chairman Colin Peterson, which banned the EPA from studying the carbon produced by corn ethanol and transferred farm emissions to the Ag Department, which mainly exists to defend farm subsidies. Not to mention the 310-page trade amendment that was introduced at 3:09 a.m. When Congress voted on the bill later that day, the House clerk didn't even have an official copy. 
The revisions were demanded by coal-dependent Rust Belt Democrats to require tariffs on goods from countries that don't also reduce their emissions. Democrats were thus admitting that the critics are right that this new energy tax would send U.S. jobs overseas. But instead of voting no, their price for voting yes is to impose another tax on imports from China and India, among others. So a Smoot-Hawley green tariff is now official Democratic policy. 
Mr. Obama's lobbyists first acquiesced to this tariff change to get the bill passed. Afterwards the President said he disliked "sending any protectionist signals" amid a world recession, but he refused to say whether this protectionism was enough to veto the bill. Then in a Saturday victory lap, he talked about green jobs and a new clean energy economy, but he made no reference to cap and trade -- no doubt because he knows that energy taxes are unpopular and that the bill faces an even tougher slog in the Senate. 
Mr. Obama wants something tangible to take to the U.N. climate confab in Denmark in December, but the more important issue is what this exercise says about his approach to governance. The President seems to believe that the Carter and Clinton Presidencies failed by fighting too much with Democrats in Congress. So his solution is to abdicate his agenda to Congress -- first the stimulus, now cap and trade, and soon health care. We wish he had told us he was running to be Prime Minister.

Abstract 
Small-size or modular reactors can play a vital role in addressing the modern energy challenges posed by climate change, depleting reserves of fossil fuel, volatile markets and energy security. 

Full Text 
I'm a retired nuclear engineer and feel compelled to comment on Bob Metcalfe's "The New Nuclear Revolution" (op-ed, June 24). He makes an excellent point for nuclear energy. It is a nonpolluting (no CO2 whatsoever) source of electricity generation. The U.S. could generate 100% of its base-load electricity-generation needs using nuclear power, as it attempted to do four decades ago. 
Unfortunately, at that time the industry was hit with questionable and expensive regulatory requirement changes extending completion times during a period of 15% interest rates, without being able to expense costs until the first watt of power was produced. Add to this that an operating license was far from guaranteed even though the go-ahead to build was granted. The industry became noncompetitive with coal plants, and withered and died even before the events of Three Mile Island. More than 100 plants were canceled. The real nuclear revolution needs to be revitalized using the large and improved reactor designs now being offered. Safe fission power is here now. 
Harold Sternberg

Bob Metcalfe makes a compelling case for the need for a new wave of nuclear power generators. Small-size or modular reactors can play a vital role in addressing the modern 
energy challenges posed by climate change, depleting reserves of fossil fuel, volatile markets and energy security. 
In my view, Mr. Metcalfe misses the one area where small-size reactors could make their greatest contribution -- the developing world. As a clean, cheap and safe alternative to 
fossil fuels, small-size reactors have the potential to drive economic and social development in large parts of the world currently held back by their shortage of energy. 

Small and modular reactors enable power to be generated locally, creating opportunities for economic growth in isolated areas, without the need for huge investment in national power distribution networks. In the longer-term, the use of nuclear energy to provide heat and water will help fight hunger, disease, poor sanitation, and water shortages in poorer countries. 
The next generation of nuclear power is not only a solution to the energy challenges of the developed world but can be a strong driver of global development and low-carbon prosperity. Oleg Deripaska CEO Basic Element Moscow 
Bob Metcalfe's praise for new "mini" nuclear plants ignores some basic facts. 

Small, dispersed nuclear reactors raise a host of unresolved safety and security issues. There would be significant challenges to ensure even the same public safety and security 
levels as those at current plants, which are, in any case, deficient. 
Proposed small reactor designs include novel features which require careful review. Mr. Metcalfe wants to speed up the approval process but it cannot be safely accelerated. 
There is no market. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission isn't inclined to waste its limited resources on licensing small reactor designs when there is no firm domestic utility 

interest. 
Big or small, nuclear plants are plagued by significant safety, security, and long-term waste-disposal problems. Lower-cost technologies, such as energy efficiency and wind, and 

other renewable energy sources, are safer and more secure, and could be deployed much more quickly. Mr. Metcalfe and his venture-capitalist colleagues would better serve the 
public by investing in these more promising technologies.

President Barack Obama said the House bill curbing greenhouse-gas emissions that passed by a close vote Friday represents "an extraordinary first step," but said he had doubts about a provision to impose tariffs on goods from countries that don't match U.S. efforts to combat global warming. 
After passing by a 219-212 vote, the bill, a priority for President Obama, faces even higher hurdles in the Senate, both from Republicans and from the president's own party, despite a 59-40 majority for Democrats. "It was a struggle to get [climate legislation] through the House, and there's no reason to think it will be any different in the Senate," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), chairwoman of one panel that has jurisdiction over climate legislation, along with Sen. Jeff Bingaman's (D., N.M.) energy committee. Ms. Boxer said she intends for her environment committee to vote on a version before Congress's August recess. 
Several Republicans, criticizing the bill's costs, suggested the House bill has little chance of passage in the Senate. "You're going to find signs on manufacturing doors, if this bill passes, that say, 'Moved, gone to China,'" said Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) on ABC's "This Week." 
Among the most controversial parts of the House bill is the provision inserted by Democratic leaders that would impose tariffs on goods imported from countries that don't match U.S. carbon-dioxide restrictions -- a slap at China and India that some business interests fear could provoke a trade war. The tariff would take effect in 2020 and fall on a range of products from countries that don't adopt similar programs to control emissions. 
Supporters say a tariff is needed to shield U.S. industries such as steel and cement makers from unfair competition abroad. The proposal also is designed to give Congress leverage to force imposition of a tariff even if the president resists. 
President Obama, speaking to reporters Sunday, didn't say whether he would veto the bill if the measure remains a part of it, or whether he will work to remove it in negotiations with Congress. "At a time when the economy world-wide is still deep in recession, and we've seen a significant drop in global trade, I think we have to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals out there," he said. He added that he was "mindful" of the need to level the playing field internationally for U.S. business. 
The bill would create a system that lets companies buy and sell pollution permits, while complying with progressively tighter caps on emissions. U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions would be cut by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% by midcentury. 
It also would mandate that coal-burning electric utilities use greater amounts of renewable fuels like solar and wind power and would provide incentives to develop clean-energy technologies. The legislation gives businesses -- including power generators -- more than 60% of the pollution permits for free in the early years of the program. 
Business factions remain split. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers lobbied against passage, while groups that represent airlines, oil producers and mining companies expressed disappointment, saying the bill would lead to onerous new costs. "It will affect every aspect of the American economy, harming our ability to compete in the world and provide secure and affordable energy to American consumers and businesses," the National Mining Association said in a statement. 
But the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, backed it, as did companies with big investments in alternatives to fossil fuels. "The House has taken an important first step on a road that will help the industry scale to a point at which we no longer need government incentives," said Bryan Ashley, vice president of Suniva Inc., a Georgia solar-cell manufacturer. 
The bill contained a range of compromises. The original goal for 2020, for instance, was a cut of 25% of emissions from 2005 levels, not 17%. But leaders made a deal with Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D., Minn.), who spoke for many rural lawmakers, letting the Agriculture Department run a key program for farmers, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency. Some Farm Belt lawmakers fear the EPA would be less friendly to agribusiness. 
Even after those changes, nearly one in five Democrats defected from the House bill. That the climate bill is coming at the same time as the president's health-care plan makes it an even tougher sell to some from conservative districts. 
Similar compromises to woo centrist Democrats loom for the health-care bill, which faces votes in both chambers later this summer. Some Senate Democrats are whittling down provisions considered sacrosanct by liberal advocates, reducing proposed subsidies for the uninsured and opposing the creation of a government-run plan to compete with private insurers. 
The intraparty tensions are frustrating some Democratic leaders and activists, who believe they have an opportunity to enact a broad liberal agenda. MoveOn.org announced Friday that it is running ads criticizing Sen. Kay Hagan, a newly elected Democrat from North Carolina, for opposition to a publicly run plan as part of a health overhaul. 
Mr. Obama and his top aides at the White House played down intraparty tensions, as well as the 44 Democrats who voted against the climate bill. "I think those 44 Democrats are sensitive to the immediate political climate of uncertainty around this issue," the president said. 
A senior aide even suggested the climate vote "has helped health care enormously," demonstrating that Congress is capable of confronting big issues.

Abstract 
Republicans' argument that the cap-and-trade program would effectively impose a national energy tax on consumers and businesses was a message likely to resonate in conservative congressional districts won by moderate Democrats in the past two elections. While lawmakers in both chambers craft health-care bills for votes later this summer, some Senate Democrats are whittling down provisions considered sacrosanct by liberal advocates, reducing proposed subsidies for the uninsured and opposing the creation of a government-run plan to compete with private insurers. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- As Congress tackles U.S. President Barack Obama's top two domestic priorities -- climate change and health care -- he faces some of his most serious challenges from fellow Democrats. 
The narrow passage Friday of an environment bill came with nearly one in five Democrats defecting, and only after supporters from coal-producing and agriculture districts won concessions that eased the impact on business and aggravated some environmentalists. Prospects for the measure remain uncertain in the Senate, even though Democrats hold a 59-40 voting majority. 
Some Democratic defections were to be expected. Republicans' argument that the cap-and-trade program would effectively impose a national energy tax on consumers and businesses was a message likely to resonate in conservative congressional districts won by moderate Democrats in the past two elections. 
The friction is emerging despite the fact that Democrats hold the White House and overwhelming majorities in both the House and Senate. But Mr. Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are pressing an unusually ambitious agenda, and most of the Democrats' recent gains came from capturing seats in conservative areas, whose representatives are less likely to go along with his more far-reaching plans. 
The question is whether the self-identified centrist Democrats will end up thwarting Mr. Obama's key priorities, or mainly act as an influence in scaling them back. 
While lawmakers in both chambers craft health-care bills for votes later this summer, some Senate Democrats are whittling down provisions considered sacrosanct by liberal advocates, reducing proposed subsidies for the uninsured and opposing the creation of a government-run plan to compete with private insurers. 
Democratic moderates' influence has been felt across an array of issues. Sen. Ben Nelson (D., Neb.) helped force a reduction in the price tag of Mr. Obama's $787 billion stimulus bill. Other Democrats forced changes to address business concerns about an initiative that would make it easier for homeowners to shed mortgage debt in bankruptcy court. Southern Democratic opposition has hurt the prospects of a law making it easier for unions to organize. 
Republicans scoff at the notion that, on balance, Democrats are moderating their agenda. "Democrats are pushing a government takeover of our health-care system that will cost at least $1 trillion," Ohio Rep. John Boehner, the House Republican leader, said in his weekly radio address Saturday. That comes after "the president and Democrats on Capitol Hill continued their push for Speaker Pelosi's national energy tax," he said, referring to the climate bill. 
But the intraparty tensions are frustrating some Democratic leaders and activists, who believe they have an opportunity to enact a broad liberal agenda. MoveOn.org announced Friday that it is running ads criticizing Sen. Kay Hagan, a newly elected Democrat from North Carolina, for opposition to a publicly run plan as part of a health overhaul. 
Some Democratic lawmakers say they are trying to keep the party from moving too far left and alienating voters. "I've always thought a divided government works best," said Rep. Allen Boyd, a Democrat from Florida's conservative panhandle. "It's incumbent on us, now that we're in the majority, to use that leverage however we can." 
The divisions inside the Democratic Party were on full display in the days and weeks of horse-trading leading to Friday's climate-change vote. 
In the weeks they spent shaping the bill, the White House and House leaders altered many of the key provisions to address concerns from members in conservative-leaning districts. The bill is designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 17% by 2020, rather than the original goal of 25%. In a deal with Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D., Minn.), who spoke for many rural lawmakers, leaders agreed to let the Agriculture Department run a key program for farmers, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency, which was seen as being less friendly to agribusiness. 
Even after those changes, passage remained in doubt. As the vote loomed, Ms. Pelosi plunged deep into the details, meeting at one point with a handful of lawmakers from timber-producing states worried the legislation isn't flexible enough to allow certain wood byproducts to be used to help generate renewable fuels. 
The bill ultimately passed 219-212, with 44 Democrats opposed. Eight Republicans voted for the bill. Democrats have a 256-178 majority in the House. 
Mr. Obama and his top aides at the White House play down the intraparty tensions. "I think those 44 Democrats are sensitive to the immediate political climate of uncertainty around this issue," the president said in an interview with newspaper reporters Sunday. "They've got to run every two years, and I completely understand that." One senior Obama aide suggested the climate vote "has helped health care enormously," demonstrating that Congress is capable of confronting big issues. 
But health care is also proving to be a tough fight. 
Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, who has a long history of irritating fellow Democrats by deviating from party orthodoxy, is working hard to forge a health bill that can attract Republican support. 
Mr. Baucus hasn't released his bill, but said last week that he had slashed its cost to $1 trillion from $1.6 trillion, in part by trimming subsidies for the uninsured. 
After Friday's vote on climate change, California Rep. Henry Waxman -- chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- was already shifting focus. His panel has jurisdiction over both climate and health. "Now we go on to health care," he said, vowing Democrats would pull together. "We are going to live up to the expectations."

Abstract 
According to the CBO, the climate legislation would cost the average household only $175 a year by 2020. During the brief few days in which the bill was debated in the House Energy Committee, Republicans offered three amendments: one to suspend the program if gas hit $5 a gallon; one to suspend the program if electricity prices rose 10% over 2009; and one to suspend the program if unemployment rates hit 15%. 

Full Text 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has put cap-and-trade legislation on a forced march through the House, and the bill may get a full vote as early as Friday. It looks as if the Democrats will have to destroy the discipline of economics to get it done. 
Despite House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman's many payoffs to Members, rural and Blue Dog Democrats remain wary of voting for a bill that will impose crushing costs on their home-district businesses and consumers. The leadership's solution to this problem is to simply claim the bill defies the laws of economics. 
Their gambit got a boost this week, when the Congressional Budget Office did an analysis of what has come to be known as the Waxman-Markey bill. According to the CBO, the climate legislation would cost the average household only $175 a year by 2020. Edward Markey, Mr. Waxman's co-author, instantly set to crowing that the cost of upending the entire energy economy would be no more than a postage stamp a day for the average household. Amazing. A closer look at the CBO analysis finds that it contains so many caveats as to render it useless. 
For starters, the CBO estimate is a one-year snapshot of taxes that will extend to infinity. Under a cap-and-trade system, government sets a cap on the total amount of carbon that can be emitted nationally; companies then buy or sell permits to emit CO2. The cap gets cranked down over time to reduce total carbon emissions. 
To get support for his bill, Mr. Waxman was forced to water down the cap in early years to please rural Democrats, and then severely ratchet it up in later years to please liberal Democrats. The CBO's analysis looks solely at the year 2020, before most of the tough restrictions kick in. As the cap is tightened and companies are stripped of initial opportunities to "offset" their emissions, the price of permits will skyrocket beyond the CBO estimate of $28 per ton of carbon. The corporate costs of buying these expensive permits will be passed to consumers. 
The biggest doozy in the CBO analysis was its extraordinary decision to look only at the day-to-day costs of operating a trading program, rather than the wider consequences energy restriction would have on the economy. The CBO acknowledges this in a footnote: "The resource cost does not indicate the potential decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) that could result from the cap." 
The hit to GDP is the real threat in this bill. The whole point of cap and trade is to hike the price of electricity and gas so that Americans will use less. These higher prices will show up not just in electricity bills or at the gas station but in every manufactured good, from food to cars. Consumers will cut back on spending, which in turn will cut back on production, which results in fewer jobs created or higher unemployment. Some companies will instead move their operations overseas, with the same result. 
When the Heritage Foundation did its analysis of Waxman-Markey, it broadly compared the economy with and without the carbon tax. Under this more comprehensive scenario, it found Waxman-Markey would cost the economy $161 billion in 2020, which is $1,870 for a family of four. As the bill's restrictions kick in, that number rises to $6,800 for a family of four by 2035. 
Note also that the CBO analysis is an average for the country as a whole. It doesn't take into account the fact that certain regions and populations will be more severely hit than others -- manufacturing states more than service states; coal producing states more than states that rely on hydro or natural gas. Low-income Americans, who devote more of their disposable income to energy, have more to lose than high-income families. 
Even as Democrats have promised that this cap-and-trade legislation won't pinch wallets, behind the scenes they've acknowledged the energy price tsunami that is coming. During the brief few days in which the bill was debated in the House Energy Committee, Republicans offered three amendments: one to suspend the program if gas hit $5 a gallon; one to suspend the program if electricity prices rose 10% over 2009; and one to suspend the program if unemployment rates hit 15%. Democrats defeated all of them. 
The reality is that cost estimates for climate legislation are as unreliable as the models predicting climate change. What comes out of the computer is a function of what politicians type in. A better indicator might be what other countries are already experiencing. Britain's Taxpayer Alliance estimates the average family there is paying nearly $1,300 a year in green taxes for carbon-cutting programs in effect only a few years. 
Americans should know that those Members who vote for this climate bill are voting for what is likely to be the biggest tax in American history. Even Democrats can't repeal that reality.

Abstract 
In May, he accused the EPA of being "in bed with the oil industry" after the agency proposed rules that could undercut the perceived climate-protection value of growing corn to make ethanol in the U.S. by counting the increased greenhouse gas emissions that would occur overseas when farmers or governments clear land to grow food in response to higher food prices. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The fate of the leading proposal to curb U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions is in the hands of Rep. Collin Peterson, a Marlboro-smoking free spirit who scoffs at warnings about climate change and says the Environmental Protection Agency is "in bed with" with corporations opposed to the ethanol industry. 
Mr. Peterson -- a Minnesota Democrat whose chairmanship of the House Agriculture Committee gives him sway over Farm Belt lawmakers -- has forced Democratic Party leaders to slow their drive to pass climate legislation and to consider amending it in ways that some environmentalists worry will lessen its effectiveness. 
Mr. Peterson on Friday asked White House officials and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to intervene in negotiations between him and the climate bill's main sponsor, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.). "I'm getting tired of going around in circles," Mr. Peterson told reporters. 
Mr. Waxman has said he is "very close" to an agreement with Mr. Peterson that would clear the way for a vote on the legislation. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said the House is unlikely to take up climate legislation this week. 
The resistance to the climate bill from Mr. Peterson and other farm-state Democrats has exposed divisions within the majority party over whether Congress should attempt such far-reaching and potentially costly environmental legislation at the same time it is trying to overhaul the U.S. health-care system. 
Mr. Peterson, who was first elected to Congress in 1990, wants the party's leaders to soften the climate bill's impact on coal-burning power plants, scale back proposed regulation of ethanol, and make other changes that, if adopted, could steer huge sums of money to farmers who engage in environmentally friendly practices. 
With Republicans expected to oppose the measure en masse, the votes of Farm Belt Democrats are critical to the House climate bill's future. But some of the changes Mr. Peterson wants could make it less palatable to Democrats who are more liberal. 
Mr. Peterson wants the climate measure changed to allow coal-burning power plants to get free of charge more of the permits they will be required to hold in order to generate carbon dioxide. 
Mr. Peterson, who represents a rural district where 10% of the population lives in poverty, says the bill's current formula for allocating free permits would result in some states getting more permits than needed, while leaving electricity users in districts such as his facing higher energy costs. 
"If they want to pass [legislation], something's going to have to change," Mr. Peterson says. 
An accountant by training with a well-creased face and a fondness for cowboy boots, Mr. Peterson shows little enthusiasm for passing climate legislation. After the administration released a report last week by government scientists warning of increased heat, pests, water shortages, disease and other impacts of climate change on crop and livestock production, Mr. Peterson laughed and said farmers in his district would welcome warmer temperatures after a recent cold spell. 
"They're going to be able to grow more corn," he said. 
Mr. Peterson has a testy relationship with environmentalists. In May, he accused the EPA of being "in bed with the oil industry" after the agency proposed rules that could undercut the perceived climate-protection value of growing corn to make ethanol in the U.S. by counting the increased greenhouse gas emissions that would occur overseas when farmers or governments clear land to grow food in response to higher food prices. 
Mr. Peterson is pushing an amendment to the climate bill that would eliminate a requirement under the law for the EPA to measure such overseas emissions, and he wants the Agriculture Department -- rather than the EPA -- to decide what kinds of agricultural practices will qualify as "offsets," activities that avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The legislation would allow businesses to pay farmers to engage in activities like injecting the soil with seed rather than plowing the ground and causing the release of carbon. The Energy Information Administration has estimated that the market for such agricultural activities could be worth as much as $24 billion annually. A recent EPA analysis suggested the market could be much smaller.

Abstract 
Under the deal, distribution of the credits to the electric industry would be based largely on retail sales, not emissions. Since many rural states rely on coal-fired power and have fewer customers than coastal states, their electric bills could rise disproportionately. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are on the verge of a deal with rebelling Farm Belt legislators on a climate-change bill, a move that could pave the way for a full House vote on legislation as soon as next week. 
Dozens of Democrats -- mostly from Midwest agricultural states -- are concerned that the bill, which aims to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, could disproportionately raise energy prices for residents and businesses in their states. 
Lawmakers and industry officials close to the negotiations said the two sides could reach an agreement within days, under which rural utilities could receive a small share of free emission credits -- less than 1% of the total that would be handed out. The credits allow the holder to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases. 
"We're very optimistic about progress" in negotiations, said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). "We should know in the next couple of days if we'll be able to introduce the bill next week." 
If a deal is reached, prospects for passage in the House are stronger than in the Senate, where many lawmakers still have reservations about the climate-change proposal. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said he planned to take up a version of the House bill later this year. 
Under the deal, distribution of the credits to the electric industry would be based largely on retail sales, not emissions. Since many rural states rely on coal-fired power and have fewer customers than coastal states, their electric bills could rise disproportionately. The additional credits would help them offset the costs of cutting greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. 
The deal also could appease Farm Belt lawmakers by giving the U.S. Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency greater involvement in oversight of the market for "offsets," credits for projects that cut greenhouse gases. Many of the projects would likely come from the agriculture sector, such as planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide.

One thing about Barack Obama: He isn't playing defense. 
Much of the president's initial economic agenda was dictated by circumstance. The implosion of the U.S. financial system put the government in the banking and mortgage business and led the president to propose the biggest refashioning of the financial-regulatory regime since the Great Depression. The collapse of General Motors and Chrysler turned the government into the industry's most significant shareholder and strategist. The worst recession in a generation prompted fiscal stimulus that has lifted federal spending, as a share of the economy, to levels unseen since World War II. 
"Barack Obama didn't run for president to recapitalize banks, bail out insurance companies or take over automobile manufacturers," says Lawrence Summers, the president's economic adviser. "Unfortunately, none of this could be deferred given the economic crisis he inherited." 
But Mr. Obama isn't stopping at emergency repairs. He's out to make the biggest changes to the American health-care system since the advent of Medicare in 1966. And, as if that's not enough, he wants to change the way the oil- and coal-addicted U.S. economy uses energy to lighten its dependence on foreign oil and reduce carbon emissions to restrain global climate change. 
Add it up -- government plus energy and transport, health and finance -- and Mr. Obama is tinkering (and, in some cases, more than tinkering) with more than a third of the 
U.S. economy, using Bureau of Economic Analysis output-by-industry estimates as a gauge. The changes would touch anyone who gets a mortgage, sees a doctor, pays an electric bill -- in short, everyone. 
Most Americans don't appear worried about the president's ambitiousness. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll asked whether Mr. Obama is "taking on too many issues and is not focused enough on the most important ones" or is "focused and is taking on this many issues because our country is facing so many problems?" The reply: 37% said he is doing too much and 60% said he is doing a lot because the problems are so many. (The other 3% weren't sure.) 
Obama fans insist this is necessary. "They had to do something on autos. They had to do something on financial regulation. Health is different -- except that it has been an issue for so long and is getting worse," says Laura Tyson, the University of California, Berkeley economist who worked in Bill Clinton's White House. "So that leaves energy and climate change. But there is a major international conference coming up. There is no answer to climate change without international cooperation. And developing countries aren't going to get involved without the U.S. taking leadership." 
But the president is running big risks by tackling so much at once. 
Finance, health care and energy are complex. Yes, there are reasons to reshape each. Yes, with the government already so deeply involved setting rules or structuring incentives in each, a decision to stick with the status quo would be a policy decision -- and probably an unwise one. 
But sit through a briefing on the intricacies of changing the way hospitals are paid or details of regulating the size of financial companies' capital cushions or formulas for allocating carbon-emission permits among industries, and it becomes clear how many moving pieces are in each of the president's initiatives. 
Unintended consequences are inevitable, no matter how much care is taken in fashioning the ultimate legislation and the regulations that follow. "The risks are you will damage things that weren't broken," says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office chief who advised Mr. Obama's 2008 opponent, Sen. John McCain. 
The risks of mistakes are heightened because the president is expecting so much so fast from people who work for him and from the Congress. Americans think of government as a vast army of bureaucrats. But on any of these major undertakings, big decisions are made by relatively few people in the White House and federal agencies and by leaders of pivotal congressional committees. None of them are getting much rest these days. 
"The danger is that you do it real fast," Ms. Tyson acknowledges. "You may not have the people you need. You may not make the decisions you would have made had you had more time." 
It may be impossible to get as much done as quickly as Mr. Obama wants. "All this will be difficult to get through Congress," says Mr. Holtz-Eakin. "There's not that much bandwidth." 
But looking back at Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy (whose 1961 promise to put a man on the moon within a decade was achieved after his assassination) and Lyndon Johnson (on the domestic side, not Vietnam), the Obama White House sees no reason to be modest in its ambitions or its timetable. It seems to be hoping to get health care through this year, to get financial-regulatory legislation late this year or early next before memories of the crisis fade and, then, to prod the House and Senate toward a climate-change compromise in 2010. 
Makes one wonder what Mr. Obama is planning for the second half of his term.

While I was in college in the late 1960s, the problem du jour aside from Vietnam was global cooling, the return of glaciers and the starving of millions due to shorter growing seasons. For several decades the average temperature had dropped slightly and the "experts" had a new Armageddon to worry about. One suggested solution was to air drop ash from power plants on the Arctic to absorb sunlight and reverse this trend by melting the ice caps. 
When I brought this up to my geology professor he said: "They are a bunch of idiots! For 10,000 years we have been in a period of global warming, the glaciers have been retreating, are retreating today and will continue to retreat for thousands of years to come until some unknown geological event impacts the process. As for the recent cooling, there are always short cycles within long-term trends." 
So, here we are, a short 40 to 50 years later, and some "experts" want to contaminate the atmosphere with sulfate particles in order to reflect the sunlight ("It's Time to Cool the Planet," The Journal Report on the Environment, June 15). I must be living in some crazy parallel universe. 
Larry Caughlin 
Cleveland 
Essayist Jamais Cascio certainly deserves credit for creativity and chutzpah in putting forward global geoengineering proposals to cool the planet. Bypassing any further debate regarding the effects of man-made pollution versus normal (and uncontrollable) planetary cycles, Mr. Cascio proposes a stratospheric sulfate injection and pumping seawater into clouds as ways to the slow the Earth's warming. His planetary-cooling recommendations sound feasible, although he concedes that they may have very undesirable and unknowable side effects. 
The most amusing aspect is captured in one of his own questions about climate manipulation: "Would all 'odd' weather patterns be ascribed to the geoengineering effort?" It's amusing in that all of today's odd weather patterns are ascribed to global warming. The Northeast U.S., which has seen very little sunshine and has experienced abnormally cold temperatures in recent months, is a case in point. The explanation is that global warming causes climate chaos that may produce colder and wetter than normal conditions. As one who prefers warm, sunny weather, I admit that I was a global-warming fan, until it sank in that warming was causing cooling. 
Paul Schroer 
Bridgeville, Del. 
We don't need to cool the planet at all. In fact, when we get another Pinatubo or Krakatoa eruption -- and we will get one -- we will need to warm the planet, and this blather about global warming will look silly. Larry Van Sickle Austin, Texas 
Only the unimpeded progress of science and technology will reduce carbon emissions. The change from wood-based energy to coal- and petroleum-based sources occurred 
without government interference. It will be some individual, not a government agency, who will develop a new, unforeseen energy source that will revolutionize our economy. 
Scientific progress has always been the savior of the human race; the Malthusian policies of the environmentalists only lead to man's return to the primitive.

Abstract 
According to congressional financial-disclosure forms released last week, more than a quarter of the 48 members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee spearheading climate-change legislation had investments in energy, oil and natural-gas companies at the end of 2008, the most recent information disclosed.

Corrections & Amplifications 
Emily Kryder is the spokeswoman for California Democratic Rep. Lois Capps. A Wednesday U.S. News article on lawmakers' investments in energy stocks incorrectly identified her as Kirstin Walker. 
(WSJ June 18, 2009) 
As Congress moves ahead with climate-change legislation touching almost every corner of the energy industry, a number of lawmakers shaping the debate have investments in companies that would be affected by the results. 
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), one of the lead authors of a House bill that would favor alternative-energy sources, had investments of between $51,000 and $115,000 in the Firsthand Technology Value Fund at the end of last year. Three of the top 10 holdings in the Ohio fund are solar-energy manufacturers. 
Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was paid between $2,500 and $5,000 by Carrizo Oil and Gas Inc. for oil exploration on his property in 2008. In April 2008, Mr. Barton also sold shares in Reliant Energy Inc., a Houston power-plant operator, and bought stock in EOG Resources Inc., which calls itself one of the largest independent oil and gas companies in the U.S. Mr. Barton is a strong advocate for the oil industry, and has opposed the limits on emissions of so-called greenhouse gases that Mr. Markey has advocated. 
Jeff Duncan, a spokesman for Mr. Markey, said the congressman has a diverse portfolio of mutual funds and doesn't exercise any individual discretion over fund investments. A spokesman for Mr. Barton declined to comment. 
According to congressional financial-disclosure forms released last week, more than a quarter of the 48 members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee spearheading climate-change legislation had investments in energy, oil and natural-gas companies at the end of 2008, the most recent information disclosed. 
It is legal for lawmakers to own shares in companies affected by their legislation. House and Senate ethics laws allow members of Congress to hold a financial interest in a company unless a law they pass would benefit only themselves. 
Top members of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is handling the legislation in that chamber, also held stakes. Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.) had at least $22,000 invested in energy companies. As of Dec. 31, Mr. Bingaman, under his wife's name, held between $15,000 and $50,000 in Energy Future Holdings Corp., a Dallas energy holding fund with former Secretary of State James A. Baker III on its board. In 2008, the senator bought and sold between $2,000 and $30,000 in coal holding company Arch Coal Inc. and in Tulsa, Okla., energy company Helmrich & Payne Inc. 
Mr. Bingaman's office declined to comment. 
The lawmakers' financial-disclosure forms don't provide precise values of their stakes, only ranges for the value of the investments. 
Some House and Senate leaders also held stakes in the energy sector. In 2008, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif), in her husband's name, owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in Clean Energy Fuels Corp., a Seal Beach, Calif., natural-gas company. Ms. Pelosi sold her stake in Quest Energy Partners Ltd., an Oklahoma City natural-gas properties holding company, on Dec. 31. 
Republican House Whip Eric Cantor (R., Va.) sold between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ecology & Environment Inc., a sustainability company, in February 2008, and the same amount of Energy Conversion Devices Inc., a solar-energy parts maker, in May 2008. 
In August 2008, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) sold part of his $15,000 to $50,000 investment in the Dow Jones U.S. Energy Index Fund, which holds shares in Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp. 
A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi didn't return several calls seeking comment. 
A spokesman for Mr. Cantor declined to comment. Mr. Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley, referred to a letter attached to Mr. Reid's disclosure forms from the Wells Fargo Wealth Management Group saying that the investment adviser managed the senator's investments "without input" from Mr. Reid. 
Democrats are promoting policies boosting reliance on natural gas to help curb oil imports. Energy committee members Rep. Anthony Weiner (D., N.Y.), Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) and Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.) all had shares in Chesapeake Energy Inc., an Oklahoma City company that says it is the largest independent producer of natural gas and the most active driller of new wells in the nation. Mr. Weiner also holds shares in Teco Energy Inc., a Tampa, Fla., energy utility holding company. 
A spokesman for Mr. Weiner said the investment presents no conflicts for his boss. "Anthony is a middle-class person with a few thousand dollars in these stocks, and it is clear from his strong environmental record that it doesn't affect his votes," spokesman John Collins said. 
Spokesmen for Messrs. Burr and Upton declined to comment. 
California Democratic Rep. Lois Capps, an Energy panel member, owns between $1,000 and $15,000 in Wilder Hill Clean Energy Fund, which holds shares in the solar-energy company Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. and Cosan Ltd., a large alcohol and ethanol producer. 
Ms. Capps, a four-term House member, has been an opponent of new oil and gas drilling off U.S. coasts and a supporter of new solar-energy initiatives. Rather than seeing the purchases as a conflict of interest, Ms. Capps made a choice to rearrange her portfolio to "reflect her personal values and belief," said spokeswoman Kirstin Walker.

Abstract 
David MacKay, a Cambridge University physics professor, shares Mr. Lomborg's skepticism of cap and trade, but says industrialized nations need to make massive investments in clean energy using technology already available, from wind power to nuclear plants. Hal Harvey, chief executive of ClimateWorks Foundation, a network of environmental groups, supports the House climate bill, but says the first priority in Congress should be to emphasize efforts that scale back U.S. energy consumption. 

Full Text 
The argument over whether climate change is a real problem is largely settled in Washington. 
What to do about climate change? That debate is at a boil. 
Under a bill being considered in the House of Representatives, companies that generate greenhouse gases -- and their customers -- could face steadily escalating costs for using fossil fuels. But businesses could keep those costs in check by investing in technology to change their carbon-dioxide-spewing ways. The legislation would require companies to obtain permits to emit polluting greenhouse gases, and the total number of permits available in the U.S. would be capped. If new technology or efficiencies lower their emissions, businesses could sell excess permits to other companies. 
Europe has been using this approach, dubbed "cap and trade," for several years. But it is far from clear whether the system will win over U.S. lawmakers. One reason is that some political leaders are listening to the kind of doubts about the effectiveness of a cap-and-trade system put forward by a number of prominent thinkers on environmental issues. 
Some of them assert that Europe's experience with cap and trade shows that the system on its own has a negligible impact on pollution. It would make more sense, they say, to spend money on developing clean-energy technology. Others say the focus on cap and trade has diverted attention from the need for better strategies to reduce energy use. 
Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish business school professor and author, has won over many Republicans, and alienated many Democrats and environmentalists, by arguing that a cap­and-trade system rigorous enough to make a serious dent in fossil-fuel consumption isn't politically feasible. 
No matter how high oil prices rise, businesses and consumers will use fuel at roughly the same rate they do now, he says, because they have little alternative. 
For proof, he says, look at last summer's sharp run-up in oil prices. Demand for oil fell, but only by a little, he says, during a break from meetings with lawmakers -- mostly Republicans -- on Capitol Hill. "We are price-inelastic" when it comes to energy. 
Mr. Lomborg's numerous critics challenge his grasp of climate science. They also take issue with his view that governments should invest heavily in research on alternative technology instead of spending heavily to slash greenhouse-gas output in the short term. 
Mr. Lomborg says governments should commit to spending 0.05% of gross domestic product on clean-energy research, financed by a $7 a ton tax on carbon dioxide. That could address what he calls a "market failure" in the development of solar-power systems and wind turbines effective enough and cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels. Buying what he sees as today's premature renewable-energy technology "would be like putting an inefficient [computer] on everyone's desk in 1965." 
The House measure, known as the Waxman-Markey bill, would provide a total of $20 billion for clean energy research and development through 2025, a spokeswoman for the Energy and Commerce Committee says. 
David MacKay, a Cambridge University physics professor, shares Mr. Lomborg's skepticism of cap and trade, but says industrialized nations need to make massive investments in clean energy using technology already available, from wind power to nuclear plants. 
In a 2008 book, Prof. MacKay dismisses what he calls the "codswallop" in the energy debate, such as government campaigns to get citizens to turn off their cellphone chargers. In face of the enormous challenges posed by global warming, he says, such small changes amount to "a feeble gesture, like bailing the Titanic with a teaspoon." 
Instead, he says, industrial economies need to think big about energy alternatives. To wean the U.S. economy off oil or coal, he says, will require "a California's worth of wind farms, an Arizona's worth of solar" and a lot of nuclear plants, he says. Shifting the energy mix this way will require big investments, he says, and a price tag on carbon emissions of about $85 a ton. That is far more than currently contemplated under the proposed U.S. or existing European cap-and-trade systems. 
"Cap and trade," he says, "is acceptable because it achieves so little." 
Hal Harvey, chief executive of ClimateWorks Foundation, a network of environmental groups, supports the House climate bill, but says the first priority in Congress should be to emphasize efforts that scale back U.S. energy consumption. 
"There are a small number of policies that make a huge difference," he says. Among them: Pushing for "best practices" -- tougher efficiency and conservation standards -- in areas like vehicle fuel efficiency and energy consumption in buildings. 
"The lowly building code" can be used to cut energy consumption by as much as 75%, he says. The burst of effort to ratchet up energy efficiency in the U.S. after the oil shocks of the 1970s led to significant declines in energy consumption and tilted the balance of power away from oil and energy producers toward consumers -- lowering energy costs for individuals, Mr. Harvey says. 
Mr. Harvey worries that proposed emissions limits and efficiency standards that are currently part of the House bill could be watered down. Without those requirements to motivate changes in the way businesses and households consume energy, he says, "you have labored mightily and produced a mouse."

Abstract 
When I joined the business [in 2004], it seemed like a natural place to push this theme. Because I felt money had to go into developing all of these technologies to build greater efficiency in the current infrastructure, but also, longer term, to address the issue of a lower-carbon-based economy. 

Full Text 
Kevin Parker isn't about to let his passion for the environment get in the way of his day job. 
"I'm a devout capitalist, and there's money to be made whilst respecting the planet and the environment," says Mr. Parker, the global head of Deutsche Asset Management, a 
unit of Germany's Deutsche Bank AG. "These are not mutually exclusive," he says. 
Mr. Parker, a member of Deutsche Bank's group executive committee, oversees $613 billion of assets under management. Four years ago, he launched what are thought to be 

the first investment products focusing on businesses that will help mitigate the effects of climate change. Those funds currently have about $4 billion in agribusiness, clean 

technologies, energy efficiency, environmental management and water. 
A believer that information breeds action, Mr. Parker's next project is to raise awareness about the daily greenhouse-gas emissions around the world by setting up a second-by­second counter in New York City. 

The Wall Street Journal sat down with Mr. Parker recently at his Park Avenue office in New York and had a wide-ranging conversation about organic farming, the environment, renewable energy and policies to address climate change. What follow are edited excerpts of that conversation. 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: You have made the environment a major theme for Deutsche Asset Management. How did you get interested in this topic? 
KEVIN PARKER: I bought a vineyard in the South of France with a friend in 1995, and we converted it to organic and biodynamic farming based on a personal philosophy. 
Biodynamic farming is about the sustainability of soil and about creating what we call live soils, as opposed to having soils that become dead as a result of too much fertilizer. 

We believed that eventually we could make better wine as a result. And 10 years later, we have seen that's indeed the case: We were voted the 57th best wine in the world by Wine Spectator in 2005. 
WSJ: How did you go from organic wine producer to investing in mitigating the effects of global warming? 
MR. PARKER: The vineyard is what started the whole approach toward sustainability. We then looked at renewable energy around 2000, because I felt we couldn't continue to 
pollute the planet and get away with it. I made a bunch of personal investments in the sector long before I joined the asset-management business. 

When I joined the business [in 2004], it seemed like a natural place to push this theme. Because I felt money had to go into developing all of these technologies to build greater efficiency in the current infrastructure, but also, longer term, to address the issue of a lower-carbon-based economy. 
WSJ: How did you get Deutsche Bank to buy into this idea? 
MR. PARKER: That wasn't easy. It's very untypical for someone in this industry to take this issue up and be an advocate. Because in typical business, the thought is, "This is a 
cost, this is a burden." With Germany being more green than most places in the world, I think we've been able to find some early adopters. 

We built an internal consensus, and climate change ended up making the list of our megatrends in 2005. Then we launched a couple of products, and to everyone's 
astonishment, the uptake was overwhelming. In a very short period of time, we raised $12 billion. 
And by the way, of the $12 billion, only $50 million came from the U.S. 
WSJ: What is investing in the theme of climate change, anyway? 

MR. PARKER: The way we define green and climate change is a little bit different. 
The conventional wisdom says, it's all about new energy -- so it's solar, wind, biofuels, things that are in the bucket of hope. We think that's the small end of the wedge in terms 
of the investable universe, because what we've got is this enormous $100 trillion global economy that today runs on hydrocarbons. Making the existing plant equipment more 
efficient and optimizing that, and being smarter about the way in which we use energy, conserve energy and conserve valuable resources is a much more interesting part of the 
mix. 

WSJ: What are some of the specific sectors that Deutsche Asset Management invests in under the climate-change banner? 

MR. PARKER: One area that's of particular interest to me is agriculture. With energy crops and biofuels creating such a stir over the last couple of years, and the debate about food and sustainability and demographic growth causing dislocation in share prices, I asked our climate-change research team to work on a simple question: If the planet goes to nine billion people in 2050, can we feed nine billion people? 
There's enough land on the planet, at conservative productivity rates, to feed nine billion people and grow what we need to produce the energy we need. 
What's wrong with this picture is that there's a whole host of tariff systems and subsidies that create distortions on the global agriculture markets. Those distortions lead to a lack of capital formation around the logistics and the supply lines in the agricultural markets and also the development of farmland. 
As an investor, these are opportunities. 
WSJ: How do you approach new energy and clean technologies' investments? 
MR. PARKER: The developments in those areas are going to have a great impact one day on the hydrocarbon side. So you need to have a footprint in both. We have some products that are trying to capture those changes and those developments, so that we really can cover the spectrum of the available and the potential investable universe in the broad shift from high-carbon to low-carbon. 
We want to be involved all along the value chain, from the incubation of small companies and development of new technologies, all the way to the more mature business. 
WSJ: Are there any areas of investment that you avoid? 
MR. PARKER: There are certain industries that we think are going to face difficulties. We see signposts along the way that companies that are reliant on coal can't get financing, and that insurance companies are going to start putting those liabilities on balance sheets. Then the coal industry in general is going to start to face some serious headwinds. 
I cannot go to the managers [of Deutsche Asset Management] and say, "Let's get out of coal," for instance, because there may be, from time to time, some opportunities in coal. 
However, what we strive for is for our managers to understand that coal is in the firing line of this debate. This debate is an urgent and really important issue, and they'd better be aware of it. 
WSJ: If we look ahead to 2040, what kind of industry or sector that we see today would be out of business as a consequence of changing behavior or environmental changes? 
MR. PARKER: When there are large dislocations and changes in new technologies, when a new way of doing things burst on to the scene, there's a sort of adaptability of human beings. 
So it wouldn't surprise me that ExxonMobil is one of the biggest solar operators in the world in 2040. Less than 1% of the world's energy today comes from solar, there's a pretty big opportunity there, and let's not forget that ExxonMobil makes $45 billion a year in profits. 
The companies that aren't going to be around anymore are not going to be around because of mistakes they make, not because of some exogenous forces putting them out of business. 
WSJ: What do you think will make a big difference for tackling climate change in coming years? 
MR. PARKER: Until you can see the amount of carbon emissions in the atmosphere and the price of carbon every single day, I don't think the world is going to be sensitive enough to the urgency that is required to attack the problem. So you sensitize everybody to it, you remind them daily about it. Then you put a price on it, and let the market figure it out.

A precipitous drop in the price of natural gas means lower bills for some electricity consumers but spells trouble for coal producers, long the dominant source of fuel for the 
electric-power industry. 
Abundant new supplies of natural gas, combined with reduced demand for electricity, have sent prices tumbling to less than $4 per million British thermal units from more than 
$13 last July. That drop could prompt power companies to invest billions of dollars in natural-gas fired plants. 

"Nobody was talking about $3 gas a year ago," said James Daly, director of gas and energy supply for Nstar, the utility formerly known as Boston Edison. Nstar is cutting 

residential electricity rates 27% on July 1 and anticipates a similar reduction in January, if gas prices remain low. Gas is the primary generating fuel in New England. 
For more than a century, the U.S. has relied on coal to produce the biggest share of its electricity. Coal now accounts for about half of the nation's electricity, compared with 
about 21% from natural gas. 

But natural-gas plants can be built more quickly and inexpensively than coal plants, and they release about half as much carbon dioxide as coal to produce similar amounts of 

electricity. That could be a big advantage if Congress passes a climate-change bill that would cap such carbon emissions. 
This isn't the first time the power industry has embraced natural gas. In the late 1990s, as states deregulated their electricity markets, a new breed of so-called merchant 
generators built scores of gas-fired plants, encouraged by rosy supply forecasts and easy borrowing. 

Enthusiasm waned by 2002, when such merchant generators as Calpine Corp., Mirant Corp. and NRG Energy Inc., landed in bankruptcy court. Gas prices also began to rise 

sharply around 2007, following the run-up in oil. 
New natural-gas discoveries, however, in Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, have created a gas glut that analysts expect to linger. Energy consulting firm Wood 
Mackenzie predicts gas prices won't recover until 2015. 

Power companies are beginning to ratchet back investments in coal-generated plants to take advantage of low gas prices and hedge against costly climate-change legislation. 

"We're pulling back the coal throttle," said Ted Craver, chief executive of Edison International, Rosemead, Calif., which owns several coal-fired plants that sell power on the open 
market. With sales poor, his company took units out of service early for seasonal repairs this year, hoping sales will pick up this summer. 
In parts of the U.S. where there are daily electricity auctions, gas generators are chipping away at coal market share with lower prices. Coal-to-gas switching has created 

incremental gas demand of three billion cubic feet a day, and "further switching potential is still large, in our view," said a research report released June 1 by Merrill Lynch & Co. 
"Fuel switching aggravates a situation that's already bad for coal," said Shneur Gershuni, analyst at UBS Investment Research. 
Coal consumption by the U.S. power industry is expected to drop by 2.3% this year, according to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, and coal 

production by mining companies is expected to drop 5% to 10%. 

"There basically is no spot market for coal right now," adds Jim Thompson, managing editor of the Coal and Energy Price Report in Knoxville, Tenn., a coal-industry newsletter. 
"Coal companies are living off their utility contracts." 
Utilities mostly obtain coal through multiyear contracts. As a result, even though spot coal prices have fallen, prices paid by utilities are expected to rise 2% this year to an 

average of $2.11 per million BTUs. Next year, the EIA expects coal prices to dip slightly to an average of $1.91 per million BTUs. 

Those numbers suggest coal is still about half the price of natural gas. But the numbers can deceive. Gas-fired power plants convert fuel into electricity more efficiently than 
coal units, and it is cheaper to move natural gas than coal. As a result, gas can still have an advantage over coal even if the commodity cost is higher.

Abstract 
The move follows successful efforts by lawmakers from industrial and coal states to win free pollution permits for coal-fired power generators and other industries under a system proposed in the bill that would also cap greenhouse-gas emissions. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Farm Belt lawmakers said Thursday that the climate legislation in the House may not get the votes to pass unless it is made more farm-friendly. 
The warning, sounded by Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D., Minn.), presents a new obstacle to the White House's effort to get a bill passed this year. 
The objecting lawmakers -- both Democrat and Republican -- used a hearing of the House Agricultural Committee to call for changes in the bill that, if adopted, could steer more money to farmers who engage in environmentally friendly practices. The lawmakers are also seeking to blunt potentially tough new regulation of the biofuels industry. 
The move follows successful efforts by lawmakers from industrial and coal states to win free pollution permits for coal-fired power generators and other industries under a system proposed in the bill that would also cap greenhouse-gas emissions. 
House leaders want a full House vote on the Waxman-Markey bill in the next few weeks so they can turn their attention to health-care legislation. The timetable could give lawmakers who object to provisions in the more-than-900-page bill leverage to demand further changes. Thursday's hearing also previews the struggle ahead in the Senate, which has yet to take up climate legislation and where rural states have even greater influence. 
Supporters of the Waxman-Markey bill are concerned that amending the proposal to please farm-state lawmakers could undermine support for the legislation among environmental groups and lawmakers opposed to ethanol subsidies. 
At Thursday's hearing, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack urged lawmakers to see climate change "not simply as a problem but as an opportunity for those who make a living on the land." 
A provision in the legislation sponsored by Reps. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.) would allow businesses to meet their emissions reduction targets through agricultural offsets. These could include paying farmers to engage in activities that reduce or avoid emissions, such as capturing and sequestering the greenhouse gases of livestock or directly injecting the soil with seeds rather than plowing the ground and causing the release of carbon. 
The Energy Information Administration has in recent years estimated the value of so-called agricultural offsets at as much as $24 billion annually. 
The Agriculture Committee's Mr. Peterson said he and other Farm Belt lawmakers were troubled by a recent Environmental Protection Agency analysis that found the market for agricultural offsets would be much smaller than $24 billion.

Abstract 
Siobhan Hughes --- SUN-TIMES MEDIA Judge Rejects Bid to Seal Court for Bonuses Hearing Sun-Times Media Group Inc. lost a bid to shut the courtroom doors while it seeks approval to hand out $1.8 million of executive bonuses if the publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times and a group of smaller publications finds a buyer in bankruptcy protection.

MCDERMOTT 
B&W Unit Plans to Make 
Small Nuclear Reactors 
McDermott International Inc.'s Babcock & Wilcox unit outlined plans for modular, factory-made nuclear reactors that B&W says will be smaller, cheaper and quicker to make than 

reactors built on location. 

The announcement comes amid calls from some U.S. quarters for greater reliance on nuclear power. As global-warming fears rise, nuclear power's supporters cite its low 
emissions. 
Flanked by lawmakers from Ohio and Tennessee, B&W executives said at a Washington press conference that the mPower reactor will be designed to store nuclear waste in 

underground containers, while the U.S. develops a long-term storage plan. 

The reactor "gives the industry much-needed options," B&W Chief Executive Officer Brandon Bethards said. The reactors will each have a capacity of 125 megawatts, or enough 
to power an estimated 100,000 homes. The concept is to serve smaller regional and municipal utilities. 
The company has notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that it plans to submit an application for design certification in 2011. 
Exelon Corp. of Chicago and the Tennessee Valley Authority are participating in an industry council advising on the project but haven't made any decisions about purchasing the 

reactors.

SUN-TIMES MEDIA Judge Rejects Bid to Seal Court for Bonuses Hearing Sun-Times Media Group Inc. lost a bid to shut the courtroom doors while it seeks approval to hand out $1.8 million of executive bonuses if the publisher of the Chicago Sun-
Times and a group of smaller publications finds a buyer in bankruptcy protection. 
Judge Christopher Sontchi of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., asked, "Am I the only one seeing the irony in the Chicago Sun-Times seeking to seal the courtroom?" Faced with having to discuss its bonuses in open court, Sun-Times, which said open discussion of the bonus program would have a "divisive" effect on the work force, adjourned 
consideration of the matter until July, keeping documents outlining the payments under seal. 
Sun-Times filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 31. David Agay, a Sun-Times attorney with Kirkland & Ellis, said Wednesday there is as yet no bid for the company. The Internal Revenue Service is Sun-Times's largest creditor, owed as much as $500 million in back taxes and penalties dating back to the days when imprisoned former media 
mogul Conrad Black ran the company. 
Mr. Black recently won a bid to have the U.S. Supreme Court review his conviction on fraud charges.

BHP BILLITON Contract Prices Cut by 58% 
For Metallurgical Coal 
BHP Billiton Ltd. said it has agreed to cut contract prices for metallurgical coal by 58% with a significant number of the mining titan's customers. 
Demand for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, has been hit hard by the downturn in steel markets. BHP, with joint-venture partner Mitsubishi Corp., is the world's largest 

exporter of metallurgical coal. 
Analysts said the price cut won't result in changes to earnings forecasts.

CHINA HUIYUAN JUICE 
Warburg Pincus to Sell 
Its Remaining Interest 
China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. said Wednesday private-equity company Warburg Pincus LLC will sell its remaining stake in the mainland juice maker. 
Huiyuan Juice said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange it received notice from Warburg that the private-equity firm will sell its remaining holding of Huiyuan Juice's 

convertible bonds worth $2.3 million, equivalent to 3.54 million shares. 
The shares represent a 0.24% stake in Huiyuan Juice, according to a separate disclosure to the stock exchange. 
Warburg Pincus sold $65 million worth of Huiyuan Juice bonds May 19, equivalent to 98.98 million shares.

Abstract 
Electric utilities may soon face new rules requiring them to generate 20% of their power from renewable sources by 2020, according to terms in a bill to combat climate change being considered by the House of Representatives. 

Full text 
While solar power is taking root in the sunny Southwest and wind power is growing in the blustery band from the Dakotas to Texas, other places are turning to trees and grass as their best bet for producing renewable energy, leading to a new building boom in "biomass" power plants. 
Electric utilities may soon face new rules requiring them to generate 20% of their power from renewable sources by 2020, according to terms in a bill to combat climate change being considered by the House of Representatives. While the cost of generating solar and wind power is declining, making them increasingly attractive options, not all places have enough wind or sunshine to make power generation practical. 
The potential for government quotas is a major reason why electric utilities in the Southeast and parts of the Midwest are now beginning to build industrial-scale plants that burn wood and other plant material -- or "biomass." The utilities also stand to get significant federal tax credits for producing renewable energy. 
Atlanta-based Southern Co. said it will build a $135 million biomass power plant. Progress Energy Inc. recently agreed to buy power from a separate $135 million biomass power plant in Hartsville, S.C. 
Oglethorpe Power Corp., a power cooperative based in the Atlanta suburbs, said in early May that it had bought land to build at least two 100-megawatt biomass power plants, costing $400 million each. "In Georgia, trees are plentiful," says Greg Jones, an Oglethorpe spokesman, "but wind is not abundant." 
U.S. energy forecasters predict that by 2030, biomass will generate 4.5% of the kilowatts consumed in the U.S., versus 2.5% for wind, with solar coming in behind both -­though all three will trail the more established power sources of hydroelectric, nuclear, coal and natural gas. 
Proposed policy that would put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions and provide tax credits and loan guarantees for renewable energy is boosting the prospects for plant-based fuels. Another big reason for biomass's growing popularity: it's dependable. When the wind doesn't blow, electricity utilities need to fire up backup plants. But like coal, biomass can be continuously fed into a furnace to provide a steady flow of juice. 
While greenhouse gas is released when biomass is burned, the process is considered nearly carbon neutral because the plants only emit the carbon they absorbed while they were growing. The plants would release the same amount of greenhouse gas if they died naturally and decomposed. The burning of coal, by contrast, releases carbon that otherwise never would have been sent into the atmosphere. 
Using nonfood crops to make cellulosic ethanol to fuel vehicles has been the most common path laid out by Congress, but it may be more efficient to use those crops to make electricity. An acre of crops can generate enough electricity for a battery-powered SUV to travel 15,000 miles, nearly twice the distance that would be covered if the crops were turned into cellulosic ethanol, noted Elliott Campbell, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of California, Merced, in a recent article in Science magazine. 
Many of the new biomass power plants are using wood scraps left over from the region's timber industry, but some companies are considering planting crops such as energy-rich grasses designed to be burned in power plants. While the practice of burning biomass to generate power has been used in Scandinavia for decades, growing crops specifically designed for biofuel is a new development. 
That's the plan FirstEnergy Corp., Akron, Ohio, is pursuing in eastern Ohio. The company said in April it would spend $200 million retrofitting two units of a coal plant to run on briquettes made of crops grown specifically to burn in combustion boilers to make electricity. 
The use of carbon-neutral fuel is important for utilities, because they may soon have to pay for some greenhouse-gas emissions under the climate bill moving through Congress.

Abstract 
The U.S. hasn't experienced any major problems meeting demand since California's power crisis in 2000 and 2001, when traders were able to withhold supplies in the hope of driving up prices in the state's deregulated market, leading to sporadic blackouts. 

Full text 
Weak demand for electricity and abundant stockpiles of fuel are creating conditions that could benefit consumers in two important ways this summer: more reliable delivery of power and, in some places, cheaper prices. 
In most parts of the U.S., electricity reserves are getting fatter even though few power plants are being built. Overall U.S. electricity demand is expected to be 1.8% less this summer than last summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., or NERC, which is responsible for grid operations. 
Power demand in industrialized nations usually rises steadily with population growth. However, the sharp drop in the economy, which has shuttered some big power users such as auto plants, has led to an unusually large falloff in demand. Demand is usually highest in the summer, when air conditioners can strain the delivery system. 
As recently as 2006, a year of record U.S. energy demand, grid officials worried that the nation wasn't adding new generating capacity fast enough to maintain reliability. Plans for dozens of coal-fired power plants were announced by 2007, but few have gone forward because of pending climate-change legislation and a run-up in construction costs. Lower demand buys the sector some time to add other resources, most likely gas-fired plants. 
The amount of surplus generating capacity is about five percentage points higher for this summer than last, exceeding 15% in most parts of the nation and above 25% in parts of the Midwest. High numbers for these reserves give grid operators many options for meeting demand, even if some power plants have problems. 
The U.S. hasn't experienced any major problems meeting demand since California's power crisis in 2000 and 2001, when traders were able to withhold supplies in the hope of driving up prices in the state's deregulated market, leading to sporadic blackouts. A widespread blackout in eastern Canada and the U.S. in 2005 was caused by a variety of complex factors. 
Summer demand forecasts have softened. On Friday, Texas grid officials lowered their forecast for the state's summer peak demand to 63,491 megawatts, down 1,731 megawatts from what they predicted four months ago. The reduction is equivalent to shutting down three or four big power plants. 
Forward prices for bulk electricity are sinking, too, and are about half what they were a year ago.

Abstract 
The fate of Detroit isn't a matter of financial crisis, foreign competition, corporate greed, union intransigence, energy costs or measuring the shoe size of the footprints in the carbon. (What we call energy wasn't even an intellectual concept in the late 18th century -- in case you think the recent collapse of global capitalism was history's most transformative moment.) Mr. Watt did research using draft animals and found that, under optimal conditions, a dray horse could lift 33,000 pounds one foot off the ground in one minute.

Politicians, journalists, financial analysts and other purveyors of banality have been looking at cars as if a convertible were a business. Fire the MBAs and hire a poet. The fate of Detroit isn't a matter of financial crisis, foreign competition, corporate greed, union intransigence, energy costs or measuring the shoe size of the footprints in the carbon. It's a tragic romance -- unleashed passions, titanic clashes, lost love and wild horses. 
Foremost are the horses. Cars can't be comprehended without them. A hundred and some years ago Rudyard Kipling wrote "The Ballad of the King's Jest," in which an Afghan tribesman avers: 
Four things greater than all things are, -­
Women and Horses and Power and War. 
Insert another "power" after the horse and the verse was as true in the suburbs of my 1950s boyhood as it was in the Khyber Pass. 
Horsepower is not a quaint leftover of linguistics or a vague metaphoric anachronism. James Watt, father of the steam engine and progenitor of the industrial revolution, lacked a measurement for the movement of weight over distance in time -- what we call energy. (What we call energy wasn't even an intellectual concept in the late 18th century -- in case you think the recent collapse of global capitalism was history's most transformative moment.) Mr. Watt did research using draft animals and found that, under optimal conditions, a dray horse could lift 33,000 pounds one foot off the ground in one minute. Mr. Watt -- the eponymous watt not yet existing -- called this unit of energy "1 horse­power." 
In 1970 a Pontiac GTO (may the brand name rest in peace) had horsepower to the number of 370. In the time of one minute, for the space of one foot, it could move 12,210,000 pounds. And it could move those pounds down every foot of every mile of all the roads to the ends of the earth for every minute of every hour until the driver nodded off at the wheel. Forty years ago the pimply kid down the block, using $3,500 in saved-up soda-jerking money, procured might and main beyond the wildest dreams of Genghis Khan, whose hordes went forth to pillage mounted upon less oomph than is in a modern leaf blower. 
Horses and horsepower alike are about status and being cool. A knight in ancient Rome was bluntly called "guy on horseback," Equesitis. Chevalier means the same, as does Cavalier. Lose the capitalization and the dictionary says, "insouciant and debonair; marked by a lofty disregard of others' interests, rights, or feelings; high-handed and arrogant and supercilious." How cool is that? Then there are cowboys -- always cool -- and the U.S. cavalry that coolly comes to their rescue plus the proverbially cool-handed "Man on Horseback" to whom we turn in troubled times. 
Early witnesses to the automobile urged motorists to get a horse. But that, in effect, was what the automobile would do -- get a horse for everybody. Once the Model T was introduced in 1908 we all became Sir Lancelot, gained a seat at the Round Table and were privileged to joust for the favors of fair maidens (at drive-in movies). The pride and prestige of a noble mount was vouchsafed to the common man. And woman, too. No one ever tried to persuade ladies to drive sidesaddle with both legs hanging out the car door. 
For the purpose of ennobling us schlubs, the car is better than the horse in every way. Even more advantageous than cost, convenience and not getting kicked and smelly is how much easier it is to drive than to ride. I speak with feeling on this subject, having taken up riding when I was nearly 60 and having begun to drive when I was so small that my cousin Tommy had to lie on the transmission hump and operate the accelerator and the brake with his hands. 
After the grown-ups had gone to bed, Tommy and I shifted the Buick into neutral, pushed it down the driveway and out of earshot, started the engine and toured the neighborhood. The sheer difficulty of horsemanship can be illustrated by what happened to Tommy and me next. Nothing. We maneuvered the car home, turned it off and rolled it back up the driveway. (We were raised in the blessedly flat Midwest.) During our foray the Buick's speedometer reached 30. But 30 miles per hour is a full gallop on a horse. Delete what you've seen of horse riding in movies. Possibly a kid who'd never been on a horse could ride at a gallop without killing himself. Possibly one of the Jonas Brothers could land an F-14 on a carrier deck. 
Thus cars usurped the place of horses in our hearts. Once we'd caught a glimpse of a well-turned Goodyear, checked out the curves of the bodywork and gaped at that swell pair of headlights, well, the old gray mare was not what she used to be. We embarked upon life in the fast lane with our new paramour. It was a great love story of man and machine. The road to the future was paved with bliss. 
Then we got married and moved to the suburbs. Being away from central cities meant Americans had to spend more of their time driving. Over the years away got farther away. Eventually this meant that Americans had to spend all of their time driving. The play date was 40 miles from the Chuck E. Cheese. The swim meet was 40 miles from the cello lesson. The Montessori was 40 miles from the math coach. Mom's job was 40 miles from Dad's job and the three-car garage was 40 miles from both. 
The car ceased to be object of desire and equipment for adventure and turned into office, rec room, communications hub, breakfast nook and recycling bin -- a motorized cup holder. Americans, the richest people on Earth, were stuck in the confines of their crossover SUVs, squeezed into less space than tech-support call-center employees in a Mumbai cubicle farm. Never mind the six-bedroom, eight-bath, pseudo-Tudor with cathedral-ceilinged great room and 1,000-bottle controlled-climate wine cellar. That was a day's walk away. 
We became sick and tired of our cars and even angry at them. Pointy-headed busybodies of the environmentalist, new urbanist, utopian communitarian ilk blamed the victim. They claimed the car had forced us to live in widely scattered settlements in the great wasteland of big-box stores and the Olive Garden. If we would all just get on our Schwinns or hop a trolley, they said, America could become an archipelago of cozy gulags on the Portland, Ore., model with everyone nestled together in the most sustainably carbon-neutral, diverse and ecologically unimpactful way. 
But cars didn't shape our existence; cars let us escape with our lives. We're way the heck out here in Valley Bottom Heights and Trout Antler Estates because we were at war with the cities. We fought rotten public schools, idiot municipal bureaucracies, corrupt political machines, rampant criminality and the pointy-headed busybodies. Cars gave us our dragoons and hussars, lent us speed and mobility, let us scout the terrain and probe the enemy's lines. And thanks to our cars, when we lost the cities we weren't forced to surrender, we were able to retreat. 
But our poor cars paid the price. They were flashing swords beaten into dull plowshares. Cars became appliances. Or worse. Nobody's ticked off at the dryer or the dishwasher, much less the fridge. We recognize these as labor-saving devices. The car, on the other hand, seems to create labor. We hold the car responsible for all the dreary errands to which it needs to be steered. Hell, a golf cart's more fun. You can ride around in a golf cart with a six-pack, safe from breathalyzers, chasing Canada geese on the fairways and taking swings at gophers with a mashie. 
We've lost our love for cars and forgotten our debt to them and meanwhile the pointy-headed busybodies have been exacting their revenge. We escaped the poke of their noses once, when we lived downtown, but we won't be able to peel out so fast the next time. In the name of safety, emissions control and fuel economy, the simple mechanical elegance of the automobile has been rendered ponderous, cumbersome and incomprehensible. One might as well pry the back off an iPod as pop the hood on a contemporary motor vehicle. An aging shade-tree mechanic like myself stares aghast and sits back down in the shade. Or would if the car weren't squawking at me like a rehearsal for divorce. You left the key in. You left the door open. You left the lights on. You left your dirty socks in the middle of the bedroom floor. 
I don't believe the pointy-heads give a damn about climate change or gas mileage, much less about whether I survive a head-on with one of their tax-sucking mass-transit projects. All they want to is to make me hate my car. How proud and handsome would Bucephalas look, or Traveler or Rachel Alexandra, with seat and shoulder belts, air bags, 5-mph bumpers and a maze of pollution-control equipment under the tail? 
And there's the end of the American automobile industry. When it comes to dull, practical, ugly things that bore and annoy me, Japanese things cost less and the cup holders are more conveniently located. 
The American automobile is -- that is, was -- never a product of Japanese-style industrialism. America's steel, coal, beer, beaver pelts and PCs may have come from our business plutocracy, but American cars have been manufactured mostly by romantic fools. David Buick, Ransom E. Olds, Louis Chevrolet, Robert and Louis Hupp of the Hupmobile, the Dodge brothers, the Studebaker brothers, the Packard brothers, the Duesenberg brothers, Charles W. Nash, E. L. Cord, John North Willys, Preston Tucker and William H. Murphy, whose Cadillac cars were designed by the young Henry Ford, all went broke making cars. The man who founded General Motors in 1908, William Crapo (really) Durant, went broke twice. Henry Ford, of course, did not go broke, nor was he a romantic, but judging by his opinions he certainly was a fool. 
America's romantic foolishness with cars is finished, however, or nearly so. In the far boondocks a few good old boys haven't got the memo and still tear up the back roads. Doubtless the Obama administration's Department of Transportation is even now calculating a way to tap federal stimulus funds for mandatory OnStar installations to locate and subdue these reprobates. 
Among certain youths -- often first-generation Americans -- there remains a vestigial fondness for Chevelle low-riders or Honda "tuners." The pointy-headed busybodies have yet to enfold these youngsters in the iron-clad conformity of cultural diversity's embrace. Soon the kids will be expressing their creative energy in a more constructive way, planting bok choy in community gardens and decorating homeless shelters with murals of Che. 
I myself have something old-school under a tarp in the basement garage. I bet when my will has been probated, some child of mine will yank the dust cover and use the proceeds of the eBay sale to buy a mountain bike. Four things greater than all things are, and I'm pretty sure one of them isn't bicycles. There are those of us who have had the good fortune to meet with strength and beauty, with majestic force in which we were willing to trust our lives. Then a day comes, that strength and beauty fails, and a man does what a man has to do. I'm going downstairs to put a bullet in a V-8.

Abstract 
Bjorn Lomborg's claim in "The Climate-Industrial Complex" (op-ed, May 21) that electric utilities like Duke Energy would get a "free lunch" ignores the fact that the climate change bill being debated in the U.S. House ensures that the value of emission allowances must go directly to utility customers.

Bjorn Lomborg's claim in "The Climate-Industrial Complex" (op-ed, May 21) that electric utilities like Duke Energy would get a "free lunch" ignores the fact that the climate change bill being debated in the U.S. House ensures that the value of emission allowances must go directly to utility customers. The House bill also requires that this must be validated by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Our state regulators also testified before the committee that each and every dime of any emission allowances granted to regulated utilities must flow directly back to customers, not shareholders. 
This will ensure that the 25 states that depend on coal for more than 50% of their electricity are not punished with immediate rate shock by climate change legislation. These states will have to shut down and replace the majority of their fossil fuel power plants as a result of the climate change legislation. Having to pay for emission allowances up front to keep power flowing is an unfair "double hit." 
To learn more about these facts, I suggest Mr. Lomborg read the testimony from regulators who testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, or contact the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners in Washington.

Bjorn Lomborg's op-ed on the Copenhagen Climate Council's World Business Summit unfairly seeks to link our members with the likes of Enron and the arms industry. Contrary to Mr. Lomborg's assertions, the summit will not be hearing from James Lovelock. I have always believed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections of sea-level rise resulting from thermal expansion of the oceans are correct. 
Mr. Lomborg lambastes the self-interest of businesses involved in addressing climate change, failing to recognize the existence of perverse subsidies to polluting industries, or to distinguish between enlightened self-interest and greed. His overall tone is thus cynical rather than skeptical. It is also suggestive of conspiracy. Yet ours is an open meeting, whose aspirations can be readily accessed at our Web site, . Mr Lomborg concludes that "The climate-industrial complex does not promote discussion on how to overcome this challenge in a way that will be best for everybody." Let your readers be the judge.

Mr. Lomborg may leave well-meaning idealists uneasy over big business throwing its baggage on the global-warming train in hopes that government will dictate people buying -­and buying into -- things for which the market would otherwise be, let's say, limited. 
But Mr. Lomborg is unambiguously a believer in the increasingly shaky science behind global warming. While he performs a genuine service by recalling President Eisenhower's 1961 farewell address warning about the "military-industrial complex," it's also fitting to recall that the very same section of that brief address warned about the consequences for scientific research from a sort of science-government complex then emerging. 
Eisenhower said, "Partly because of the huge costs involved [in scientific research], a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. . . . The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite." 
Not bad for a retired general, seeing, almost 50 years out, that sensible scientists would be able to discern what government wanted "discovered" and would get busy either 
discovering it or discrediting any contrary view. Good stuff to know with the Waxman-Markey environmental legislation rolling along.

Abstract 
Dynegy Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and Edison International are among the companies that would receive credits, because they own coal-fired power plants that sell electricity at market prices. 

Full Text 
State utility regulators and consumer advocates are urging Congress to eliminate a provision in the pending climate-change bill that gives free emission allowances to certain companies that burn coal to make electricity. 
The Waxman-Markey bill, which cleared a key House committee Thursday, would give as much as 5% of initial credits to merchant coal generators and 30% to electric utilities when a cap-and-trade program is scheduled to begin in 2012. Unlike utilities, whose prices are controlled, merchant coal generators sell electricity to other companies at market prices. 
Utilities are expected to use their credits to cover their own emissions, or sell the credits and use the money to hold down consumer energy costs, which are expected to rise as a result of the legislation. But there's no guarantee unregulated coal generators would use their credits to reduce electricity prices, which would ultimately benefit consumers. They could take the credits and not reduce their prices. 
Under a cap-and-trade program, companies that produce greenhouse gases would be given credits covering a portion of their emissions. If some companies produce less than their "cap," they could "trade" their credits with others. 
In the past few days, state regulators have urged bill authors Reps. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.) to redirect to utilities all of the credits earmarked for merchant coal generators. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, in a letter, wrote the congressmen that giving credits to the coal generators "will only lead to windfall profits for a particular sector of the electricity industry at the expense of end-use customers." 
Other groups, including those that represent consumer advocates and public-power utilities, also oppose the allocation method laid out in the House bill, HB 2454. "Our concern is that market prices will rise anyway, and consumers won't get the benefit of the allowances given coal generators," said David Springe, consumer counsel of the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board in Topeka, Kan., and president of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates. 
Generators disagree that credits could result in windfall profits. The credits will cover only half the emissions they are expected to produce by generating electricity with coal, and they will likely have to buy the other half of the credits they need. 
Dynegy Inc., NRG Energy Inc. and Edison International are among the companies that would receive credits, because they own coal-fired power plants that sell electricity at market prices. These merchant generators face more financial risks than utilities, because they aren't regulated monopolies, and they're allowed to earn higher profits than utilities. 
Approximately one-quarter of the nation's coal-fired generating capacity is owned by merchant generators. Many power plants changed hands when states deregulated their retail electricity markets and utilities divested themselves of their generation fleets. 
Ted Craver, chief executive of Edison, based in Rosemead, Calif., said that generators need free credits or some may be forced "to shut down, which creates reliability issues." 
His company owns 7,400 megawatts of coal-fired generation in the Midwest. Coal-based generators face billions of dollars in costs from pollution-control upgrades that will be required in coming years. Generators need clarity about carbon costs, said Mr. Craver, so they will know which plants are worth upgrading. 
Some coal generators are experiencing hard times, because low natural-gas prices are allowing gas generators to seize market share from coal generators. In March, the most recent month for which federal data were available, production from gas-fired plants increased 4.5%, while production at coal-fired plants fell 16.1% versus March 2008. Consumption slipped 3.9% from a year earlier. 
Merchant coal generators were in better shape a few years ago when natural gas prices were high. At the time, they were able to sell electricity in deregulated markets at high prices set by gas units, even though their costs were low. Now, profit margins are compressed and costs of complying with pollution-control requirements are rising.

Abstract 
The point of climate-change legislation is to raise the price of activities that emit carbon so consumers and businesses engage in fewer of them, and favor alternatives that contribute less to climate change. Giving away allowances yields windfall profits -- unless the government controls prices, as it does with electric utilities. 

Full text 
President Barack Obama was emphatic during his campaign and after his election: The best way to fight climate change is to cap carbon emissions and auction off tradable permits to emit carbon. 
"If you're giving away carbon permits for free, then basically you're not really pricing the thing and it doesn't work -- or people can game the system in so many ways that it's not creating the incentive structures that we're looking for," he told the Business Roundtable in March. 
His budget director, Peter Orszag, was blunter: "If you didn't auction the permit, it would represent the largest corporate welfare program that has ever been enacted in the history of the United States," he told the House Budget Committee in March. 
This past week, Rep. Henry Waxman's House Energy and Commerce Committee passed a climate-change bill that gives away 85% of the emission permits until 2026. President Obama applauded, calling the bill "a historic leap." 
Huh? 
The point of climate-change legislation is to raise the price of activities that emit carbon so consumers and businesses engage in fewer of them, and favor alternatives that contribute less to climate change. Taxing carbon is one way to do that, but it's unpopular. 
Cap-and-trade became the politicians' favorite alternative because it accomplished what a carbon tax would, without an explicit tax. Auctioning off the permits, economists advised, was the most efficient way to allocate the rights; steer at least some of the money raised toward research and development and to compensate lower-income consumers for higher energy prices. 
Republicans called that "a light-switch tax." Democratic old-timers warned about being "BTU'd," a reference to President Bill Clinton's ill-fated energy tax. Support for auctioning permits evaporated. Under the House bill, only 15% of the emission permits will be auctioned initially. 
The rest of the permits will be given away -- 2% to oil refiners, 5% to free-standing "merchant" coal plants, 9% to regulated natural-gas distributors, and so on. Permits are valuable; recipients can sell them if they don't need them. 
As Europe's experiment with cap-and-trade demonstrated, giving away permits can fatten polluters' profits without protecting consumers from higher prices. 
"How one gives them away, what restrictions are on that gift, makes all the difference in the world for the economic effects," said Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office. In other words, Congress will put strings on the gifts. And then things get complicated. 
Giving away allowances yields windfall profits -- unless the government controls prices, as it does with electric utilities. The bill gives 30% of the permits to utilities that buy electricity from power plants and then sell that power to consumers. Congress is counting on state regulators to make utilities pass the benefits of free emission permits along to consumers. 
That eliminates the windfall-profits problem, but creates another one. 
Remember, if electricity prices don't rise, households won't conserve and carbon emissions won't be reduced. So emissions elsewhere in the economy will have to be reduced to meet the national cap on carbon. How? By boosting prices for carbon-heavy activities besides electricity production. Can you say "gasoline"? 
Waxman defenders hope state regulators will allow electricity prices to rise so people use less, and then give a quarterly or annual rebate. But Robert Stavins, a Harvard University economist, warns: "The political instinct is not to compensate, but to insulate consumers" from price increases. That's a mistake. 
Unregulated industries are different. Producers will charge what the market will bear, whether they pay for permits or get them for nothing. Congress, for good reason, worried about boosting the costs for American factories that compete with factories in countries that don't require producers to buy emission permits. The Waxman bill gives such producers 15% of the permits, and more permits if they increase production in the U.S. That reduces the temptation to move production abroad but blunts the incentive to reduce pollution. 
Among the arguments for giving away permits, two have merit. One, allocation rules can be crafted to award free permits to protect parts of the country that otherwise would see very steep increases in energy prices from a carbon cap, such as those that rely on coal. Two, this approach may be the only politically possible way to get any cap on carbon emissions through Congress. 
But there's another rub: Without the auctions, there isn't any revenue. Mr. Obama's budget proposal projected more than $75 billion a year from the auction, much of which was supposed to go to his "making work pay" tax break. 
The U.S. government entered the recession with promises to pay health-care and retirement benefits far greater than its anticipated revenue. It's now borrowing heavily to resuscitate the economy and rehabilitate the financial system. 
The deficit is tolerable now because the recession is so deep and foreigners so willing to lend to the U.S. at low rates. But at some point, like it or not, the federal government will need more revenue. Giving away emission permits instead of auctioning them crosses one big potential source of revenue off the list.

Abstract 
[...] the latest version of the climate bill, which is being debated in a congressional committee this week, has disappointed natural-gas advocates by giving away large emission allowances to coal-fired power generation. 

Full text 
Natural-gas futures continued their wild ride as a report on gas storage sparked new worries that demand isn't recovering as quickly as some traders predicted. 
On Thursday, prices dropped 9.2% -- the biggest percentage decline since August 2007 -- as rising inventories in a weekly storage report from the Energy Information Administration spooked traders. Gas settled at $3.603 per million British thermalunits at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas stockpiles rose by 103 billion cubic feet from the previous week, worse than already-bearish Wall Street estimates. Storage levels are now nearly a third higher than the 
same time last year, and 22% above the five-year average. 
Traders have been forced to "refocus on the underlying factors," said Gene McGillian, a broker at Tradition Energy. 
Prices soared 37% between late-April and mid-May after a sharp decline in rig counts was viewed as a harbinger of tighter supply. But over the past eight sessions, prices have 

retreated 20%. 

Demand has been hit hard by the weak economy, which reduced the need for gas to generate electricity, power factories and make plastics and other products. U.S. gas 
consumption fell 9.1% in February from the same month a year ago, led by a 14.9% drop in industrial demand, according to the EIA. 
Natural-gas investors had hoped that climate-change legislation would improve long-term demand, betting that a cap on carbon emissions would push power companies to burn 

more gas, which emits about half as much carbon as coal to produce the same amount of electricity. But the latest version of the climate bill, which is being debated in a 

congressional committee this week, has disappointed natural-gas advocates by giving away large emission allowances to coal-fired power generation. 
Meanwhile, supplies have been growing. In recent years, high prices, easy credit and new technologies led natural-gas producers to discover vast new fields in Texas, Louisiana 
and elsewhere, driving up U.S. gas production. 

Falling prices have led companies to slash spending, and the number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. has fallen by 55% since September, according to Baker Hughes Inc. 

Despite the falling rig count, producers have struggled to rein in production. Major gas producers such as Devon Energy Corp., XTO Energy Inc. and Petrohawk Energy Corp. 
reported double-digit production growth in the first-quarter, largely because of huge wells in new fields. 
"The industry's a bit of a victim of their own success," said Dave Pursell, an analyst with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., an energy-focused investment bank in Houston.

Abstract 
At a White House meeting Wednesday, members of President Barack Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board endorsed the central idea of the 900-plus page measure -- to cap carbon emissions and require businesses to buy tradeable permits to pollute. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of climate change policy estimated that price increases associated with a 15% cut in carbon dioxide emissions would cost the average U.S. household $1,600 a year. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The "American Clean Energy and Security Act" is one of the most ambitious efforts to re-engineer American social and economic behavior in decades, presenting risks and opportunities for a wide array of businesses from Silicon Valley to the coal fields of the Appalachians. 
The legislation, better known as the Waxman-Markey bill, isn't yet law and has big hurdles to clear. A critical vote looms this week in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. But even with its chances of passage uncertain, the measure has become the basis for debate in Washington over how the U.S. should respond to pressure to slash its carbon emissions. 
At a White House meeting Wednesday, members of President Barack Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board endorsed the central idea of the 900-plus page measure -- to cap carbon emissions and require businesses to buy tradeable permits to pollute. The measure could create "green" jobs in the U.S. while reducing harmful pollution that might be causing global climate change, executives in the group said. They included General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who sat next to the president. 
Mr. Obama said he's "excited about the opportunity" to develop such a system and that "we've seen some great progress this week" in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The bill has been put forward by U.S. Reps. Henry A. Waxman, (D., Calif.) and Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.). It's prospects look good in the House, but it could face a tougher time in the Senate. Still, the bill is the most viable yet to tackle climate change. 
If adopted, it would confront big sectors of the economy with potentially costly challenges. The bill requires that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases linked to climate change be cut by 83% from their 2005 levels by 2050, long after most current members of Congress will have left office. The planned reduction is all the more ambitious considering that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions grew by 17% between 1990 and 2007. 
To drive businesses and power generators to use less oil and coal and slash emissions of other gases, the Waxman-Markey bill would make businesses acquire pollution permits, which they could use to cover their emissions and sell any spares. 
The current draft of the bill would give away up to 85% of those permits over the next 20 years. Still, instituting a cap and trade system would start the process of putting a price on emitting carbon dioxide. The bill's supporters say that is enough to start driving the technological innovation and investment needed to move away from fossil fuels. 
"Putting a price on carbon is the most important thing we can do," Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr told reporters after the meeting of the president's advisory board. Mr. Doerr, a partner at, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, is one of a number of tech figures who have invested some of the wealth they earned during the Internet boom in clean-energy ventures that could get a boost from the Waxman-Markey proposal. 
Critics of Waxman-Markey, most of them Republicans but also some Democrats, say it is a tax by another name applied in a complex and costly way. 
A Congressional Budget Office analysis of climate change policy estimated that price increases associated with a 15% cut in carbon dioxide emissions would cost the average 
U.S. household $1,600 a year. The CBO analysis said low income households would shoulder a larger burden, as would families in coal dependent regions such as the Ohio Valley. 
Harvard University economics professor Martin Feldstein questioned during the meeting with Mr. Obama whether the price might be too high for U.S. consumers, but said giving away too many pollution credits to utilities could undermine the goal of reducing emissions. 
"You have to raise the price to consumers to get them to cut back," Mr. Feldstein said. "I have a hard time understanding the give-away strategy." 
Lawmakers say they would compensate consumers for the added burden through tax credits and direct government subsidies. The Waxman-Markey bill would use the states to funnel monthly payments to low-income households, defined as those eligible for food stamps or with gross income up to 150% of the poverty line. 
But the Waxman-Markey bill is more than just cap and trade. The proposal would establish requirements that utilities buy at least 12% of their electricity from renewable sources such as windmills, solar panels and geothermal technology. 
Another section promotes "large scale" programs to spur demand for electric vehicles with incentives for buying plug-in cars and building charging stations. 
The proposed bill offers auto makers several forms of assistance to make the shift to lower-carbon cars. They include as much as $50 billion in loans under an Energy Department program to spur advanced vehicle development and up to $4 billion for subsidies to consumers who trade in older vehicles for more efficient models. 
In addition, auto makers would get 3% of the free pollution allowances through 2017 and 1% from 2018 through 2025 -- tied to investments in electric vehicles and other advanced technology. 
The proposal would offer rebates to spur demand for appliances that are not only energy efficient, but also come equipped with "smart grid" technology that would allow a dishwasher to know the most economical time of day to run based on variable electric rates. Retailers would get incentives to push highly efficient appliances to consumers. 
The act would order the Department of Energy to see to it that building codes are amended to make new buildings 30% more efficient by 2010 and 50% more efficient by 2016. The act would even establish new efficiency standards for "portable light fixtures," also known as lamps.

Abstract 
[...] many CEOs are genuinely concerned about global warming. [...] research shows that each new job cost Spain 571,138 euros, with subsidies of more than one million euros required to create each new job in the uncompetitive wind industry. [...] the programs resulted in the destruction of nearly 110,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy, or 2.2 jobs for every job created. 

Full Text 
Some business leaders are cozying up with politicians and scientists to demand swift, drastic action on global warming. This is a new twist on a very old practice: companies using public policy to line their own pockets. 
The tight relationship between the groups echoes the relationship among weapons makers, researchers and the U.S. military during the Cold War. President Dwight Eisenhower famously warned about the might of the "military-industrial complex," cautioning that "the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist." He worried that "there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties." 
This is certainly true of climate change. We are told that very expensive carbon regulations are the only way to respond to global warming, despite ample evidence that this approach does not pass a basic cost-benefit test. We must ask whether a "climate-industrial complex" is emerging, pressing taxpayers to fork over money to please those who stand to gain. 
This phenomenon will be on display at the World Business Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen this weekend. The organizers -- the Copenhagen Climate Council -- hope to push political leaders into more drastic promises when they negotiate the Kyoto Protocol's replacement in December. 
The opening keynote address is to be delivered by Al Gore, who actually represents all three groups: He is a politician, a campaigner and the chair of a green private-equity firm invested in products that a climate-scared world would buy. 
Naturally, many CEOs are genuinely concerned about global warming. But many of the most vocal stand to profit from carbon regulations. The term used by economists for their behavior is "rent-seeking." 
The world's largest wind-turbine manufacturer, Copenhagen Climate Council member Vestas, urges governments to invest heavily in the wind market. It sponsors CNN's "Climate in Peril" segment, increasing support for policies that would increase Vestas's earnings. A fellow council member, Mr. Gore's green investment firm Generation Investment Management, warns of a significant risk to the U.S. economy unless a price is quickly placed on carbon. 
Even companies that are not heavily engaged in green business stand to gain. European energy companies made tens of billions of euros in the first years of the European Trading System when they received free carbon emission allocations. 
American electricity utility Duke Energy, a member of the Copenhagen Climate Council, has long promoted a U.S. cap-and-trade scheme. Yet the company bitterly opposed the Warner-Lieberman bill in the U.S. Senate that would have created such a scheme because it did not include European-style handouts to coal companies. The Waxman-Markey bill in the House of Representatives promises to bring back the free lunch. 
U.S. companies and interest groups involved with climate change hired 2,430 lobbyists just last year, up 300% from five years ago. Fifty of the biggest U.S. electric utilities -­including Duke -- spent $51 million on lobbyists in just six months. 
The massive transfer of wealth that many businesses seek is not necessarily good for the rest of the economy. Spain has been proclaimed a global example in providing financial aid to renewable energy companies to create green jobs. But research shows that each new job cost Spain 571,138 euros, with subsidies of more than one million euros required to create each new job in the uncompetitive wind industry. Moreover, the programs resulted in the destruction of nearly 110,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy, or 2.2 jobs for every job created. 
The cozy corporate-climate relationship was pioneered by Enron, which bought up renewable energy companies and credit-trading outfits while boasting of its relationship with green interest groups. When the Kyoto Protocol was signed, an internal memo was sent within Enron that stated, "If implemented, [the Kyoto Protocol] will do more to promote Enron's business than almost any other regulatory business." 
The World Business Summit will hear from "science and public policy leaders" seemingly selected for their scary views of global warming. They include James Lovelock, who believes that much of Europe will be Saharan and London will be underwater within 30 years; Sir Crispin Tickell, who believes that the United Kingdom's population needs to be cut by two-thirds so the country can cope with global warming; and Timothy Flannery, who warns of sea level rises as high as "an eight-story building." 
Free speech is important. But these visions of catastrophe are a long way outside of mainstream scientific opinion, and they go much further than the careful findings of the United Nations panel of climate change scientists. When it comes to sea-level rise, for example, the United Nations expects a rise of between seven and 23 inches by 2100 -­considerably less than a one-story building. 
There would be an outcry -- and rightfully so -- if big oil organized a climate change conference and invited only climate-change deniers. 
The partnership among self-interested businesses, grandstanding politicians and alarmist campaigners truly is an unholy alliance. The climate-industrial complex does not promote discussion on how to overcome this challenge in a way that will be best for everybody. We should not be surprised or impressed that those who stand to make a profit are among the loudest calling for politicians to act. Spending a fortune on global carbon regulations will benefit a few, but dearly cost everybody else. 
Mr. Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus, a think tank, and author of "Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming" (Knopf, 2007).

Full Text 
Jon Basil Utley writing at Reason.com: 
It's only a matter of time before President Barack Obama's vast popularity runs aground on his energy policies. In the name of saving the planet from global warming, he has delayed new oil drilling, an action that will have major political repercussions once the world economy recovers. Instead of using some [of] the stimulus billions to produce more gas and oil, Obama's wild-eyed supporters dream of "renewable" energy derived from corn, wind, sunshine, and even grass. 
With the appointment of extremists like climate czar Carol Browner and science adviser John Holdren, Obama has placed his administration's environmental policy in the hands of radicals. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar proposes replacing oil and coal with windmills. Yet Barron's recently reported that America would need to build 500,000 giant offshore windmills and transmission lines to produce Salazar's specified 1,900 gigawatts of electricity. In contrast, oil and gas drilling could provide hundreds of thousands of solid, well-paying blue-collar jobs. . . . 
All of these things are happening at a time when natural gas is abundant and cheap. The new technology of horizontal fraccing has made it economically feasible to drill into vast shale deposits in many states, even famously difficult ones like Michigan and New York. Many cars could run on natural gas, much like many buses do already. On a recent trip to Peru, I learned that most taxicabs have been converted to natural gas for a cost of about $1,000 each. New technologies continually revive old oil and gas fields and make new ones economically viable. So it's little more than socialist Malthusianism to argue that the world is running out of cheap energy. Science will always find and harness new sources.

Indiana Says 'No Thanks' to Cap and Trade

Abstract 
California, Massachusetts and New York -- seeking to exploit politically weaker colonies in order to prop up their own decaying economies. Because proceeds from their new taxes, levied mostly on us, will be spent on their social programs while negatively impacting our economy, we Hoosiers decline to submit meekly. 

Full Text 
This week Congress is set to release the details of the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act, a bill that purports to combat global warming by setting strict limits on carbon emissions. I'm not a candidate for any office -- now or ever again -- and I've approached the "climate change" debate with an open-mind. But it's clear to me that the nation, and in particular Indiana, my home state, will be terribly disserved by this cap-and-trade policy on the verge of passage in the House. 
The largest scientific and economic questions are being addressed by others, so I will confine myself to reporting about how all this looks from the receiving end of the taxes, restrictions and mandates Congress is now proposing. 
Quite simply, it looks like imperialism. This bill would impose enormous taxes and restrictions on free commerce by wealthy but faltering powers -- California, Massachusetts and New York -- seeking to exploit politically weaker colonies in order to prop up their own decaying economies. Because proceeds from their new taxes, levied mostly on us, will be spent on their social programs while negatively impacting our economy, we Hoosiers decline to submit meekly. 
The Waxman-Markey legislation would more than double electricity bills in Indiana. Years of reform in taxation, regulation and infrastructure-building would be largely erased at a stroke. In recent years, Indiana has led the nation in capturing international investment, repatriating dollars spent on foreign goods or oil and employing Americans with them. Waxman-Markey seems designed to reverse that flow. "Closed: Gone to China" signs would cover Indiana's stores and factories. 
Our state's share of national income has been slipping for decades, but it is offset in part by living costs some 8% lower than the national average. Doubled utility bills for low-income Hoosiers would be an especially cruel consequence of the Waxman bill. Forgive us for not being impressed at danglings of welfare-like repayments to some of those still employed, with some fraction of the dollars extracted from our state. 
And for what? No honest estimate pretends to suggest that a U.S. cap-and-trade regime will move the world's thermometer by so much as a tenth of a degree a half century from now. My fellow citizens are being ordered to accept impoverishment for a policy that won't save a single polar bear. 
We are told that although China, India and others show no signs of joining in this dismal process, we will eventually induce their participation by "setting an example." Watching the impending indigence of the Midwest, and the flow of jobs from our shores to theirs, our friends in Asia and the Third World are far more likely to choose any other path but ours. 
Politicians in Washington speak of a reawakened appreciation for manufacturing and American competitiveness. But under their policy, those who make real products will suffer. Already we observe the piranha swarm of green lobbyists wangling special exemptions, subsidies and side deals. The ordinary Hoosier was not invited to this party, and can expect at most only table scraps at the service entrance. 
No one in Indiana is arguing for the status quo: Hoosiers have been eager to pursue a new energy future. We rocketed from nowhere to national leadership in biofuels production in the last four years. We were the No. 1 state in the growth of wind power in 2008. And we have embarked on an aggressive energy-conservation program, indubitably the most cost-effective means of limiting CO2. 
Most importantly, we are out to be the world leader in making clean coal -- including the potential for carbon capture and sequestration. The world's first commercial-scale clean coal power plant is under construction in our state, and the first modern coal-to-natural gas plant is coming right behind it. We eagerly accept the responsibility to develop alternatives to the punitive, inequitable taxation of cap and trade. 
Our president has commendably committed himself to "government that works." But his imperial climate-change policy is government that cannot work, and we humble colonials out here in the provinces have no choice but to petition for relief from the Crown's impositions. 
Mr. Daniels, a Republican, is the governor of Indiana.

Abstract 
Earlier in the day, Republicans pounced on a White House document that says regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act is likely to have serious economic consequences for regulated entities throughout the U.S. economy, including small businesses and small communities.\n 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- House Democratic leaders said Tuesday evening they had reached agreement within their caucus on climate-change legislation that sets easier targets for emissions reductions and renewable-energy requirements than originally proposed. 
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.) has been negotiating with a group of Southern and Midwestern Democrats on his committee who have withheld support for his bill because they feared it would hurt the economies in their states. 
Mr. Waxman's bill calls for capping emissions of greenhouse gases, and requiring companies to hold permits in order to emit such gases. But the original version of the proposal was silent on the degree to which companies would have to pay for those permits, versus being given them free. Utilities dependent on coal and other carbon-intensive industries such as steel plants or oil refineries have been lobbying Congress to give them the permits for free, at least initially. 
"I think we have the basis of an agreement with members of the Democratic caucus," Mr. Waxman said. He said a new version of the proposal would be made public Thursday and that he expects the Energy and Commerce Committee to vote on the measure next week. 
Virtually all of the Republicans on the panel are expected to oppose the bill, but Mr. Waxman may not need their support if most of the Democrats are on his side. "I expect we're going to have the votes to pass this out of committee," he said. 
If the bill can get passed by his panel, which is among the largest and most ideologically and geographically diverse in Congress, the legislation is widely seen as having a strong chance of passing the full House and possibly the Senate as well. 
Bowing to members of his party whose states depend heavily on cheap, coal-fired electricity, Mr. Waxman told reporters late Tuesday that he has agreed to amend the legislation so that it requires a cut in U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, rather than a 20% cut in that time frame, as called for in the original version of his proposal. 
Mr. Waxman said Tuesday he has agreed to give away to electric utilities 35% of the emissions permits that would be created by the bill, at least initially, rather than require them to pay for the permits. 
People familiar with the outlines of the deal said that under the revised proposal, auto makers initially would receive 3% of the permits free, and that certain trade-sensitive industries, such as aluminum, glass and steelmakers, initially would get 15% free. 
Those concessions would be a win for the affected industries, potentially worth billions of dollars. It wasn't clear how long the free permits would be granted. 
A senior Republican on the committee, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, said Republicans are preparing to introduce as many as 200 amendments aimed at slowing down the bill and eliminating major provisions of the legislation. "Bring your No Doze," he said, predicting numerous late-night meetings of the panel next week. 
Republicans and other interest groups were already turning up the heat on Democrats and the Obama administration ahead of Tuesday's deal. Earlier in the day, Republicans pounced on a White House document that says regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act "is likely to have serious economic consequences for regulated entities throughout the U.S. economy, including small businesses and small communities." 
The document, an amalgamation of comments by government agencies sent from the Office of Management and Budget to the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year, presents a more dire view of the consequences of regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act than the Obama administration has publicly stated. 
Asked about the memo at a Senate hearing Tuesday, the EPA's administrator, Lisa Jackson, said the agency's recent declaration that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare is preliminary and might not lead to regulations under the Clean Air Act. She reiterated the administration's preference for legislation such as Mr. Waxman's that would cap and gradually reduce emissions, while allowing companies to buy and sell emissions permits. 
House Minority Leader John Boehner (R., Ohio) said the OMB memo "suggests that a political decision was made to put special interests ahead of middle-class families and small businesses struggling in this recession."

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Monday that it expected even wider deficits this year and next than previously forecast, and Congress could undermine the administration's push to narrow the gap by slashing the revenue generated by the president's plan to curb greenhouse gases. 
On Monday, White House budget director Peter Orszag revised the fiscal 2009 deficit upward by $89 billion to $1.84 trillion, 12.9% of the economy. That is a level not seen since 1945. Next year's deficit forecast was raised $87 billion, to $1.26 trillion. 
White House officials still say they are holding to a long-term goal of cutting the inherited budget deficit in half by 2013. But that effort is threatened by the weak economy and by congressional politics. White House economists didn't revise their expectation that the economy would be growing by 3.5% by the end of this year, despite the fact that some private economists have been lowering their forecasts. 
Congress is debating proposals to give away to utilities and other businesses the pollution credits that would be created by a cap-and-trade system. Such a system is designed to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by instituting caps, and requiring that businesses buy permits to pollute that they can trade like commodities. 
Beginning in 2012, the White House budget had counted on the sale of greenhouse-gas emissions permits to bring in $77 billion to $79 billion a year through 2019. Of the $624 billion in revenue, the White House allocated $504 billion to a $800-per-family tax cut for households with incomes below $150,000, in part to offset the impact of the cap-and­trade system on electricity rates. An additional $15 billion a year was dedicated to developing and deploying renewable-energy efforts to replace the fossil fuels being hit by the pollution trading system. 
If Congress decides to give away permits, that would mean less money for policy ideas such as the president's Making Work Pay tax cut and his push to wean the nation off fossil fuels, and less money for deficit reduction. 
"At least half the revenue that the administration is expecting is just not going to materialize," said Daniel J. Weiss, director of Climate Strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank closely allied with the Obama White House. 
A White House official said Monday that the tax cut won't be extended beyond 2010 if the administration can't find a way to pay for it. The administration is still holding out hope that the sale of emissions permits will generate more than enough revenue to finance its alternative-energy plan. 
Just how much money the administration might have to work with will become clearer when House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) unveils his full climate-change bill this week. He hopes to have a vote on the bill in his committee by Memorial Day. 
Congressional aides and lobbyists familiar with the bill say as much as 75% of the emissions credits will be given away free in the first few years of the plan. Many of those free credits will go to coal-fired utilities that would struggle to cover the cost of permits for all the carbon they emit. Energy-intensive industries that face stiff global competition would get most of their emissions permits free in the first years of trading as well. 
It may be 10 to 15 years until all the emissions permits will be sold, according to people familiar with the legislation. 
Seeking to bolster public support for climate legislation, the Obama administration is consulting pollsters who advocate avoiding phrases such as "cap-and-trade" and "global warming." On Monday, the White House Council on Environmental Quality was scheduled to meet with Robert Perkowitz, president of ecoAmerica, a Washington-based nonprofit that uses "psychographic research" to "shift personal and civic choices of environmentally agnostic Americans," according to its Web site. 
"We're trying to give them phrases that work," Mr. Perkowitz said in an interview. He said that in a survey of some 2,000 Americans conducted by his group in March and April, less than half of the respondents said they would support a "cap-and-trade" policy, and that only 24% said they knew what the phrase means. "If you call it 'clean energy dividend' . . . almost anything other than 'cap and trade,' you'll get people responding a lot more favorably," he said.

Tapping Methane's Value --- Miners Begin Capturing Gas, Gaining Credits in Process

Abstract 
The EPA encourages coal producers to capture methane from their mines and either sell it into the natural-gas market or dispose of it through oxidation or flaring, and sell the carbon credits. 

Full Text 
As the U.S. moves closer to regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, capturing methane from coal mines could be increasingly lucrative for mining companies. 
Methane is highly flammable and for safety reasons must be removed before underground mining can take place. But it's also a valuable commodity that can be sold into the natural-gas market. What's more, mines that reduce the amount escaping get valuable carbon credits. 
President Barack Obama has proposed cutting U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% by 2050. The Environmental Protection Agency is moving toward regulating greenhouse gases as a pollutant while Congress considers proposals to cap CO2 emissions by creating a market for emitters to buy and sell allowances. 
U.S. coal mines emit significant amounts of methane, which has 20 times the heat-trapping capability of carbon dioxide. Coal mines account for less than 5% of total U.S. carbon emissions, which could keep them out of the cross-hairs of regulation. Nevertheless, cutting coal-mine methane emissions could become a growing business. 
Walter Energy Inc. recently installed a demonstration project at one of its Brookwood, Ala., mines to capture methane from a ventilation air shaft. Canadian emission-reduction firm Biothermica Technologies Inc. provided the technology, and the closely held company plans to sell the carbon credits in the U.S. voluntary carbon market. 
The pilot project is designed to remove 40,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. With U.S. carbon credits selling for anywhere from $2 to $7 a ton of carbon dioxide, the project, if scaled up, could yield a tidy sum. That's just what Walter Energy plans to do, with an eye toward selling the carbon credits and preparing for climate-change legislation. 
"It's a foregone conclusion that we're rapidly heading toward some type of carbon tax, or cap and trade," said Rich Donnelly, vice president of engineering at Walter. "We would anticipate the real potential that eventually those emissions would be scrutinized closer and maybe capped, and we'd have to get into some type of mitigation." 
Carbon market analysts see carbon credit prices rising after Congress passes climate change legislation. 
Walter, which also has a natural-gas business, produces methane gas before mining for coal underground in Alabama, which has unusually high underground methane levels. Walter has been able to generate carbon credits from some of its coal-mine methane production, and listed the credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange, where the company is a member, said Mr. Donnelly. 
Capturing methane from ventilation shafts is new -- the Walter project is the first in the U.S. But it could be the wave of the future, with the potential to capture from half to two-thirds of the methane released from mine ventilation shafts, Mr. Donnelly said. 
The EPA encourages coal producers to capture methane from their mines and either sell it into the natural-gas market or dispose of it through oxidation or flaring, and sell the carbon credits. 
"Several companies have been out in front doing this, and in some cases they're making a fair amount of money in their gas sales," said Jane Sommers, a program manager at the EPA's Coalbed Methane Outreach Program in Washington. 
In addition to Walter, Consol Energy Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. have coal-mine methane projects.

Abstract 
Mr. Obama summoned committee Democrats to the White House to urge them to intensify efforts to agree on a bill ahead of a Memorial Day deadline to ready legislation for House floor action. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Consumers would get vouchers for as much as $4,500 from the government to trade in their gas-guzzling cars under a compromise plan that could help advance a broad measure to combat climate change. 
The so-called cash-for-clunkers plan could be part of climate-change legislation being pieced together in the House. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), a co-sponsor of the climate bill, said the auto deal -- forged by Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee and endorsed by President Barack Obama -- "demonstrates how representatives from both coasts and the Rust Belt can reach agreement on difficult issues." 
The cash-for-clunkers plan would run for one year, offering vouchers to people who trade in vehicles with average city/highway fuel economy of less than 18 miles a gallon to buy a more-efficient new car or light truck. The proposed program would offer the maximum $4,500 voucher for people to use to buy a car that gets at least 10 more mpg or a truck that is at least five mpg more efficient. The program is designed to spur some one million purchases of new cars or trucks to support the ailing auto industry. 
Big hurdles remain before passage of the bigger climate measure. 
The legislation is mired in disagreements among lawmakers over potential costs to consumers and businesses. Republicans are stepping up attacks on the climate initiative, branding it a "national energy tax." Meanwhile, committee Democrats are haggling privately over details of the proposal to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Mr. Obama summoned committee Democrats to the White House to urge them to intensify efforts to agree on a bill ahead of a Memorial Day deadline to ready legislation for House floor action. 
"The message of the meeting was, I need everybody on board, and we need to make this happen," said Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley. He added Mr. Obama wanted Democrats to move because health-care reform looms "just around the corner." 
Mr. Obama did not dictate specifics, participants said, but made clear he wants a bill that eases the costs imposed on consumers and businesses, creates a predictable set of rules, and addresses concerns that some regions of the country could shoulder disproportionately heavy costs. 
"He's giving us a lot of latitude," said Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman (D., Calif.). "He wants us to move." 
Mr. Waxman's bill calls for curbing U.S. emissions by roughly 80% below 2005 levels by mid-century, by placing a cap on overall emissions and forcing companies to hold permits allowing them to emit greenhouse gases. The bill is generally silent on the degree to which companies will have to pay for those permits, and how revenue raised from selling them would be used by the government. 
In order to speed the bill along, Mr. Waxman is considering bypassing a key subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce panel and bringing the climate bill directly to the full committee. The chairman had hoped for a subcommittee vote, but winning consensus among subcommittee Democrats has proven difficult. Mr. Waxman said Tuesday that "no final decisions on process have been made," but that he is "consulting with members" of the committee "about the best way forward." 
Mr. Obama has called for using the bulk of the money raised by auctioning the permits to fund tax credits for the middle class, but lawmakers from Rust Belt and coal states are pressing him to give some permits to industries in their regions for free. 
Rep. Gene Green (D., Texas) said Mr. Obama's message on Tuesday was "work it out, so we can have a broad-based bill that will have Democratic support." Mr. Green is among the lawmakers leaning on Mr. Waxman to give away some permits to ease the impact on businesses, such as the oil and gas refiners in his district. 
As recently as March, Mr. Obama emphasized he wanted all greenhouse-gas emissions to be covered by permits that businesses would have to buy. On Tuesday, he signaled he would accept some amount of credits to be given away, said some participants in the meeting.

The EPA Follows the Supreme Court in CO2 Ruling

Abstract 
With a simple Google search, one will find that the average human being emits around 0.5 tons of CO2 per year. [...] any city or town with a population in excess of 500 (using the 250-ton figure applied to other pollutants by the EPA) could be a potential target of taxes for being a polluter, all because its inhabitants decide to engage in that selfish action called breathing. 

Full Text 
The Environmental Protection Agency's greenhouse gas endangerment finding about CO2 was hardly "Reckless 'Endangerment'" (Review & Outlook, April 24); it was simply following the rule of law. Lest you forget, the Supreme Court ruled that "EPA can avoid promulgating regulations only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change." 
Given that ruling, the EPA had no choice but to determine if greenhouse gases posed a threat to public health and welfare, and given the science it had no choice but to find endangerment, and given that finding it has no choice but to regulate. To do anything less would be reckless disregard for the law. 
W. L. Chameides Duke University Durham, N.C. 
The EPA makes CO2 illegal? Man controls the temperature and weather on earth? Proponents of human-caused global warming are going to look very foolish when the truth comes out. The earth has been warming for 12,000 years during our present interglacial cycle, and the sea level has risen 300 feet during this time. There have been many of these glacial cycles in the past. Mother Earth does not understand 1955 as a static baseline, as our politicians wish us to believe. 
Vincent Rex Ramirez 
Carson City, Nev. 
Your editorial regarding what new sources of pollution could potentially be regulated as a result of the new EPA ruling on carbon dioxide, says: "Still, why confine the rule only to cars and trucks? By the EPA's own logic, it shouldn't matter where carbon emissions come from. Carbon from a car's tailpipe is the same as carbon from a coal-fired power plant." 
Why stop there? With a simple Google search, one will find that the average human being emits around 0.5 tons of CO2 per year. Therefore, any city or town with a population in excess of 500 (using the 250-ton figure applied to other pollutants by the EPA) could be a potential target of taxes for being a polluter, all because its inhabitants decide to engage in that selfish action called breathing.

Those regulating zealots at the EPA apparently didn't have biology in their middle-school curricula. How can a gas essential to life on Earth be labeled a pollutant? Plants cannot 
survive without carbon dioxide in the air, and animals cannot survive without plants.

Abstract 
The discoveries have spurred energy experts and policy makers to start looking to natural gas in their pursuit of a wide range of goals: easing the impact of energy-price spikes, reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering "greenhouse gas" emissions and speeding the transition to renewable fuels. The bill, which could emerge from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in May, is expected to set aggressive targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent man-made greenhouse gas.

CADDO PARISH, La. -- A massive natural-gas discovery here in northern Louisiana heralds a big shift in the nation's energy landscape. After an era of declining production, the 
U.S. is now swimming in natural gas. 
Even conservative estimates suggest the Louisiana discovery -- known as the Haynesville Shale, for the dense rock formation that contains the gas -- could hold some 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That's the equivalent of 33 billion barrels of oil, or 18 years' worth of current U.S. oil production. Some industry executives think the field could be several times that size. 
"There's no dry hole here," says Joan Dunlap, vice president of Petrohawk Energy Corp., standing beside a drilling rig near a former Shreveport amusement park. 
Huge new fields also have been found in Texas, Arkansas and Pennsylvania. One industry-backed study estimates the U.S. has more than 2,200 trillion cubic feet of gas waiting to be pumped, enough to satisfy nearly 100 years of current U.S. natural-gas demand. 
The discoveries have spurred energy experts and policy makers to start looking to natural gas in their pursuit of a wide range of goals: easing the impact of energy-price spikes, reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering "greenhouse gas" emissions and speeding the transition to renewable fuels. 
A climate-change bill being pushed by President Barack Obama could boost reliance on natural gas. The bill, which could emerge from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in May, is expected to set aggressive targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent man-made greenhouse gas. 
Meeting such goals would require quickly moving away from coal-fired power plants, which account for substantial carbon emissions. President Obama wants the U.S. to rely more on renewable energy such as wind and solar power, but those technologies aren't ready to shoulder more than a fraction of the nation's energy burden. Advocates for natural gas argue that the fuel, which is cleaner than coal, would be a logical quick fix. In addition, billionaire energy investor T. Boone Pickens has been touting natural gas as an alternative to gasoline and diesel for cars and trucks. 
"The availability of natural-gas generation enables us to be much more courageous in charting a transition to a low-carbon economy," says Jason Grumet, executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, who was a senior adviser to President Obama during the campaign. 
Just three years ago, the conventional wisdom was that U.S. natural-gas production was facing permanent decline. U.S. policy makers were resigned to the idea that the country would have to rely more on foreign imports to supply the fuel that heats half of American homes, generates one-fifth of the nation's electricity, and is a key component in plastics, chemicals and fertilizer. 
But new technologies and a drilling boom have helped production rise 11% in the past two years. Now there's a glut, which has driven prices down to a six-year low and prompted producers to temporarily cut back drilling and search for new demand. 
The natural-gas discoveries come as oil has become harder to find and more expensive to produce. The U.S. is increasingly reliant on supplies imported from the Middle East and other politically unstable regions. In contrast, 98% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. is produced in North America. 
Coal remains plentiful in the U.S., but is likely to face new restrictions. To produce the same amount of energy, burning gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal. 
Natural gas has never played more than a supporting role in the nation's energy supply. Crude oil, refined into gasoline or diesel, fuels nearly all U.S. cars or trucks. Coal is the dominant fuel for generating electricity. 
Natural-gas production in the U.S. peaked in the early 1970s, then fell for a decade due to weak prices and declining gas fields in Texas, Louisiana and elsewhere. Production bounced back in the 1990s with the discovery of new fields in New Mexico and Wyoming, but by 2002, output was falling again -- this time, most experts thought, for good. Believing the U.S. would soon need to import liquefied natural gas from overseas, companies such as ConocoPhillips, El Paso Corp. and Cheniere Energy Inc. spent billions on terminals, pipelines and storage facilities. 
The supply fears drove up prices, which spurred innovation. Oil-and-gas companies had known for decades that there was gas trapped in shale, a nonporous rock common in much of the U.S. but considered too dense to produce much gas. 
In the 1980s, Texas oilman George Mitchell began trying to produce gas from a formation near Fort Worth, Texas, known as the Barnett Shale. He pumped millions of gallons of water at high pressure down the well, cracking open the rock and allowing gas to flow to the surface. 
Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp. bought Mr. Mitchell's company in 2002. It combined his methods with a technique for drilling straight down to gas-bearing rock, then turning horizontally to stay within the formation. Devon's first horizontal wells produced about three times as much gas as traditional vertical wells. 
The development of the Barnett Shale almost single-handedly reversed the decline in U.S. natural-gas production. Last year, the Barnett produced four billion cubic feet of gas a day, making it the largest field in the U.S. Other companies such as Newfield Exploration Co., Southwestern Energy Co. and Range Resources Corp. found shale fields across the 
U.S. 
One of the most aggressive companies was Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake Energy Corp., which got into the Barnett a couple of years behind cross-town rival Devon, and was an early entrant into the second big U.S. field, the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas. In 2005, Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon sent teams of geologists across the country with a mission: Find the next Barnett. Less than two years later, they told him they had it, in Louisiana. 
The Haynesville Shale is centered in northern Louisiana, one of the country's oldest oil- and gas-producing regions. Wildcatters had explored beneath the lush cow pastures and cotton fields as far back as the 1870s. Shreveport, the region's largest city, saw decades of booms and busts until the 1980s, when a glut of cheap oil from overseas all but killed the region's oil industry. 
Oil companies knew about the Haynesville Shale, but it was considered a less viable prospect than the Barnett. The shale lies 10,000 or more feet below ground, where high pressure and 300-degree temperatures are enough to fry high-tech drilling equipment. 
But in 2006, Chesapeake drilled an exploratory well and decided the results were promising enough to justify the higher cost of drilling in such harsh conditions. By late 2007, Mr. McClendon says, "we knew that we had a tiger by the tail." 
In March 2008, as oil and gas prices were soaring, Chesapeake went public with its findings. The rush was on: Dozens of companies dispatched agents to the area to lease land for drilling, turning farmers and ranchers into millionaires overnight. 
"There was excitement in the air," recalls Jeffrey Wellborn, a Shreveport resident who sits on the board of the local Sierra Club. "You thought everyone in the world had won the lottery." 
The frenzy marked the peak of a nationwide drilling boom that was fueled by a combination of soaring energy prices and easy credit. It didn't last. Between July and October, oil and gas prices fell by more than 50%, and kept falling. 
The weakening economy eroded demand for both oil and gas. Natural gas, unlike oil, suffered from a supply glut. U.S. gas production rose 7.2% last year, while oil production fell 1.9%. As a result, oil prices are up 12% since the start of 2009. Natural-gas prices have fallen 41% to their lowest since 2002. 
Gas producers saw their profits evaporate and share prices slump. Liquefied-natural-gas imports plunged, leaving import terminals nearly idle. Worried about a glut, companies cut back sharply on drilling and formed a lobbying group to try to boost demand. 
The growing supply created opportunities for policy makers and environmentalists, who saw natural gas as a possible solution to the nation's energy problems. Some groups suggested burning more gas and less coal for power generation. Others favor its use in vehicles. 
Mr. Pickens has spent millions promoting an energy plan that aims to, among other things, convert thousands of big-rig trucks to run on natural gas. Mr. Pickens has large investments in natural gas and stands to benefit if his plan is adopted. In TV ads, Internet videos and speeches, he emphasizes a different goal: reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. 
Mr. Pickens arrived for a recent speech in Dallas in a natural-gas-fueled Honda Civic with a bright blue "Pickens Plan" logo. He told a packed auditorium that the U.S. is importing two-thirds of its oil even as the country is "absolutely overwhelmed with natural gas." If the reverse were true, he said, he would favor burning oil. 
Some environmentalists have embraced Mr. Pickens's plan as a way to fight climate change. Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, says he sees natural gas as a "bridge fuel" that could help the U.S. burn less coal and oil until renewable sources of energy are ready to take over. 
The dual message of energy security and environmental responsibility has helped Mr. Pickens win powerful allies, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and dozens of elected officials from both parties. A bipartisan bill providing tax incentives for natural-gas cars looks likely to pass this year. 
Not everyone shares Mr. Pickens's enthusiasm for natural-gas vehicles. Major users of natural gas, such as utilities and chemicals companies, are concerned the plan would drive up prices -- an outcome that would benefit producers. 
Energy Secretary Steven Chu and some other policy makers have expressed doubts about the practicality of retrofitting hundreds of thousands of service stations to offer natural gas. Some environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, have argued that natural gas is better used to replace coal for power generation, and that cars should run on electricity generated by the sun, wind and natural gas. 
Market forces are already helping natural gas make inroads against coal and oil. Gas is now cheaper than coal in many parts of the country, leading utilities to burn more gas. Of the 372 power plants expected to be built in the U.S. over the next three years, 206 will be fired by gas and just 31 by coal, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
Natural gas is gaining market share far more slowly in transportation. Earlier this year, AT&T announced it would convert up to 20% of its truck fleet to run on natural gas, largely because it has been cheaper than gasoline in recent years. Cities including New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta have converted part of their bus fleets to run on natural gas, for air-quality reasons. 
Shreveport could be the next city to make the switch. In March, Mayor Cedric Glover announced that the oil capital turned natural-gas boomtown would abandon diesel and convert its bus fleet to natural gas.

Abstract 
If that weren't enough, they rolled in every other item on the green wish list: a renewable electricity standard; a low-carbon fuel standard; a broader renewable fuels policy; new efficiency standards. There's Mr. Matheson, chair of the Blue Dog energy task force, who has made a political career championing energy diversity and his state's fossil fuels, and who understands Utah is mostly reliant on coal for its electricity needs. 

Full Text 
Congressman Henry Waxman played to the crowds this week with high-profile hearings designed to boost his climate legislation. To listen to the Energy and Commerce committee chair, a House global warming bill is all but in the recyclable bag. 
To listen to Congressman Jim Matheson is something else. During opening statements, the Utah Democrat detailed 14 big problems he had with the bill, and told me later that if he hadn't been limited to five minutes, "I might have had more." Mr. Matheson is one of about 10 moderate committee Democrats who are less than thrilled with the Waxman climate extravaganza, and who may yet stymie one of Barack Obama's signature issues. If so, the president can thank Democratic liberals, who are engaging in one of their first big cases of overreach. 
Not that you couldn't see this coming even last year, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi engineered her coup against former Energy chairman John Dingell. House greens had been boiling over the Michigan veteran's cautious approach to climate-legislation. Mr. Dingell's mistake was understanding that when it comes to energy legislation, the divides aren't among parties, but among regions. Design a bill that socks it to all those manufacturing, oil-producing, coal-producing, coal-using states, and say goodbye to the very Democrats necessary to pass that bill. 
Such sense didn't deter Mrs. Pelosi, who first tried an end-run around Mr. Dingell in 2007 by putting Massachusetts Rep. Edward Markey in charge of a new global-warming committee. When that didn't get her a bill, she helped her fellow Californian, Mr. Waxman, unseat Mr. Dingell. Environmentalists threw a party, and the Waxman-Markey duo got busy on legislation to please their coastal crowds. 
Cap and trade was already going to be a brawl, but the two upped the ante by including tougher targets and restrictions. If that weren't enough, they rolled in every other item on the green wish list: a renewable electricity standard; a low-carbon fuel standard; a broader renewable fuels policy; new efficiency standards. Any one of these is a monumental fight on its own. Put together they risk an intra-party committee mutiny. 
There's Mr. Matheson, chair of the Blue Dog energy task force, who has made a political career championing energy diversity and his state's fossil fuels, and who understands Utah is mostly reliant on coal for its electricity needs. He says he sees several ways this bill could result in a huge "income transfer" from his state to those less fossil-fuel dependent. Indiana Democrat Baron Hill has a similar problem; not only does his district rely on coal, it is home to coal miners. Rick Boucher, who represents the coal-fields of South Virginia, knows the feeling. 
Or consider Texas's Gene Green and Charles Gonzalez, or Louisiana's Charlie Melancon, oil-patch Dems all, whose home-district refineries would be taxed from every which way by the bill. Mr. Dingell remains protective of his district's struggling auto workers, which would be further incapacitated by the bill. Pennsylvania's Mike Doyle won't easily throw his home-state steel industry over a cliff. 
Add in the fact that a number of these Democrats hail from districts that could just as easily be in Republicans' hands. They aren't eager to explain to their blue-collar constituents the costs of indulging Mrs. Pelosi's San Francisco environmentalists. Remember 1993, when President Bill Clinton proposed an energy tax on BTUs? The House swallowed hard and passed the legislation, only to have Senate Democrats kill it; a year later, Newt Gingrich was in charge. With Senate Democrats already backing away from the Obama cap-and-trade plans, at least a few House Dems are reluctant to walk the plank. 
Rumors were in fact flying earlier this week that Mr. Markey might have to postpone next week's subcommittee markup. For now, he and Mr. Waxman are busy trying to buy or arm-twist votes. They have some potent tools, in particular the enticement of giving some carbon-emission permits away for free, or allocating them to specific industries. Yet having set expectations so high, the duo risk losing liberal members if they give away too much. 
The Obama team is aware it has trouble, which explains last week's well-timed Environmental Protection Agency "finding" that carbon is a danger. The administration is now using this as a stick to beat Congress to act, arguing that if it doesn't the EPA will. (Reality: Any EPA actions will be tied up in court for years.) It also helps explain EPA's Monday analysis claiming the legislation won't cost all that much. (Reality: The agency could only make this claim by assuming an endless recession.) 
The real risk to the president is that his bill goes down at the hands of his own party -- with nary a Republican to blame. Whether Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Waxman considered this as they crafted their gem is unclear. But the overreach has made it a possibility now.

Abstract 
Negotiations over free emissions permits reflect the pivotal role centrist business-minded Democrats are playing in the evolving legislation to combat climate change. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are weighing a plan to give some of the nation's biggest polluters a 10-year cushion from the impact of greenhouse-gas regulations to get a 
cap-and-trade system in place now. 
Under the proposal, electric utilities would get free permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for as long as ten years, after which they would gradually begin 
paying. In exchange, utilities would be required to shield consumers and businesses from higher electricity rates during that time. They would also make investments in 
conservation and renewable energy to lessen the industry's reliance on coal. 

"We're going to have some of the money allocated to ratepayers," said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) "How much and what 

percentage, I don't know." 
Under the proposal, which is still being negotiated, electric utilities would receive about 40% of the permits allotted under a cap-and-trade program designed to gradually cut 
carbon-dioxide emissions. That is roughly equivalent to the utility industry's share of such emissions. 

Negotiations over free emissions permits reflect the pivotal role centrist business-minded Democrats are playing in the evolving legislation to combat climate change. 

Republicans are attacking the House climate bill as a job-killing tax. In response, the bill's main sponsors, Mr. Waxman and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), are working to 
shore up support among committee Democrats from the South and industrial Midwest who are worried about hurting their states' economies. 
To court the centrists, Mr. Waxman has already added a provision to commit $10 billion over ten years for development of technologies that would allow coal to be burned 

cleanly. That's important to Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, a Democrat who represents a coal-producing region and now a key figure in the debate. 

Mr. Waxman also agreed to protect such trade-sensitive industries as cement and steel by granting them some permits without cost, the better to compete with rivals in other 
countries with less stringent rules. The measure is a priority of Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat. 
By showing flexibility with House moderates, Mr. Waxman could make his bill more palatable in the Senate, where strong concerns also exist among Democratic centrists. Still, 

he has by no means locked down the votes of House moderates. 
Some economists say giving away permits to electric utilities will artificially suppress price increases in electric bills and undercut incentives for consumers to reduce electricity. 
The Waxman-Markey bill aims to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 80% by 2050. The proposal would put a cap on the total amount of 

greenhouse gases emitted by businesses across the economy and allow individual companies to buy and sell permits giving them the right to pollute. 

Crucial questions remain, such as which industries will have to pay for pollution permits and how the revenue they generate will be distributed. The bill Mr. Waxman made public a few weeks ago is largely silent on these issues. Top House Democrats are also considering a proposal to create a second consumer rebate to help lower- and middle-income families offset the higher energy costs of the cap­
and-trade program. 
"There should be no cost to the consumer," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Wednesday. She vowed the legislation would "make good on that" pledge.

Abstract 
According to EPA, the average permit today takes 866 hours for a source to prepare, and 301 hours for EPA to process. [...] even as taxpayers are now paying tens of billions of dollars to prop up GM and Chrysler, Ms. Jackson will be able to tell the entire auto industry it must make even more small cars that consumers don't want to buy. 

Full Text 
President Obama's global warming agenda has been losing support in Congress, but why let an irritant like democratic consent interfere with saving the world? So last Friday the Environmental Protection Agency decided to put a gun to the head of Congress and play cap-and-trade roulette with the U.S. economy. 
The pistol comes in the form of a ruling that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant that threatens the public and therefore must be regulated under the 1970 Clean Air Act. This so-called "endangerment finding" sets the clock ticking on a vast array of taxes and regulation that EPA will have the power to impose across the economy, and all with little or no political debate. 
This is a momentous decision that has the potential to affect the daily life of every American, yet most of the media barely noticed, and those that did largely applauded. When America's Founders revolted against "taxation without representation," this is precisely the kind of kingly diktat they had in mind. 
Michigan Democrat John Dingell helped to write the Clean Air Act, as well as its 1990 revision, and he says neither was meant to apply to carbon. But in 2007 five members of the Supreme Court followed the environmental polls and ordered the EPA to determine if CO2 qualified as a "pollutant." The Bush Administration prudently slow-walked the decision. As Peter Glaser, an environmental lawyer at Troutman Sanders, told Congress in 2008, "The country will experience years, if not decades, of regulatory agony, as EPA will be required to undertake numerous, controversial, time-consuming, expensive and difficult regulatory proceedings, all of which ultimately will be litigated." 
The Obama EPA has now opened this Pandora's box. The centerpiece of the Clean Air Act is something called the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, under which the EPA decides the appropriate atmospheric concentration of a given air pollutant. Under this law the states must adopt measures to meet a NAAQS goal, and the costs cannot be considered. For global warming, this is going to be a hugely expensive futility parade. 
Greenhouse gases mix in the atmosphere, and it doesn't matter where they come from. A ton of emissions from Ohio has the same effect on global CO2 as a ton emitted in China; and even if Ohio figured out a way to reduce its emissions to zero, it would still have no control over the carbon content in its ambient air. But under the law, EPA would be required to severely punish Ohio -- and every state -- for not complying with NAAQS. 
Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA also must regulate all "major" sources of emissions that emit more than 250 tons of an air pollutant in a year. That includes "any building, structure, facility or installation." This might be a reasonable threshold for conventional pollutants such as SOX or NOX, but it's extremely low for carbon. Hundreds of thousands of currently unregulated sources will suddenly be subject to the EPA's preconstruction permitting and review, including schools, hospitals, malls, restaurants, farms and colleges. According to EPA, the average permit today takes 866 hours for a source to prepare, and 301 hours for EPA to process. So this regulatory burden will increase by several orders of magnitude. 
The EPA took the highly unusual step of not accompanying its endangerment finding with actual proposed regulations. For now, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson claims her agency will only target cars and trucks. That is bad enough. It probably means, for example, that California's mileage fleet burdens will seep out to every other state. So even as taxpayers are now paying tens of billions of dollars to prop up GM and Chrysler, Ms. Jackson will be able to tell the entire auto industry it must make even more small cars that consumers don't want to buy. 
Still, why confine the rule only to cars and trucks? By the EPA's own logic, it shouldn't matter where carbon emissions come from. Carbon from a car's tailpipe is the same as carbon from a coal-fired power plant. And transportation is responsible for only 28% of U.S. emissions, versus 34% for electricity generation. Ms. Jackson is clearly trying to limit the immediate economic impact of her ruling, so as not to ignite too great a business or consumer backlash. 
But her half-measure is also too clever by half. By finding carbon a public danger, she is inviting lawsuits from environmental lobbies demanding that EPA regulate all carbon sources. Massachusetts and two other states have already sued in federal court to force the EPA to create a NAAQS for CO2. 
Which brings us back to the Obama Administration's political roulette. Democrats know that their cap-and-tax agenda is losing ground, notably among Midwestern Senators. The EPA "endangerment" is intended to threaten businesses and state and local governments until they surrender and support the Obama agenda. The car industry is merely the first target, meant to be the object lesson. 
Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey put it this way at MIT recently: "Do you want the EPA to make the decision or would you like your Congressman or Senator to be in the room and drafting legislation? . . . Industries across the country will just have to gauge for themselves how lucky they feel if they kill legislation in terms of how the EPA process will include them." 
This "Dirty Harry" theory of governance -- Do you feel lucky? -- is as cynical as it is destructive. And contra Mr. Markey, if cap and tax is killed this year, it will be done in by Democrats, many of whom are starting to realize the economic harm it would inflict. In March, the Senate voted 89 to 8 on a resolution vowing to pass a climate bill only if 
"such legislation does not increase electricity or gasoline prices." 

That's called democracy, but for the Obama Administration such debate is an inconvenient truth. If they can't get Congress to pass their agenda, they'll use EPA and the courts 
to impose it. How lucky do you feel?

Abstract 
The campaign, crafted by Washington Media Group, is one of a growing number of efforts by advocacy groups to shape major policy changes sought by the White House and congressional Democrats. Since Mr. Obama's inauguration, $270 million has been spent on television advertisements designed to influence public-policy decisions, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan organization that tracks television spending. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- A pilots group on Monday launched an advertising campaign designed to shoot down an Obama administration proposal to levy new user fees on planes, part of a surge in spending on issue ads by lobbying organizations. 
The new $1.5 million ad blitz by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a Washington-based group whose 416,000 members fly everything from turboprops to hot-air balloons, takes aim at a forthcoming White House plan that would place more than $7 billion in new user fees on aircraft that use airspace managed by federal air-traffic controllers. 
AOPA tapped the star power of actor Harrison Ford, a long-time pilot and AOPA member. In one print ad, Mr. Ford rails against a "misguided budget scheme that would impose crippling new fees on general aviation that could devastate small communities in every state." 
The campaign, crafted by Washington Media Group, is one of a growing number of efforts by advocacy groups to shape major policy changes sought by the White House and congressional Democrats. 
Since Mr. Obama's inauguration, $270 million has been spent on television advertisements designed to influence public-policy decisions, according to Campaign Media Analysis Group, a nonpartisan organization that tracks television spending. That is up significantly from the same period at the beginning of the last session of Congress in 2007. It took until September 2007 for so-called issue-advocacy spending to reach $270 million in the previous cycle, according to the organization. 
The rise in such advertising underscores Washington's new prominence in the economy. 
"What has surprised me so much this year is that nobody has sat back and waited to see what Congress is going to do," said Evan Tracey, chief operating officer of Campaign Media Analysis Group. 
Energy issues have been the focus of more than $115 million in advertising, according to the analysis. Much of that spending has been dedicated to influencing legislation that would seek to reduce global warming, according to the analysis. The industry-backed American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, for example, says it will spend about $17 million on television ads this year. 
Health-care organizations have spent millions of dollars on advertisements, according to the analysis. The newly formed Conservatives for Patients Rights says it will spend $20 million urging Democrats to enact a health-care law that relies on the free market, rather than the government. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce kicked off a $1 million campaign last week in an effort to block legislation that would make it easier to unionize employees, part of a broader $30 million campaign touted by industry coalitions. Organized-labor groups say they have spent $10 million on ads since Labor Day to generate support for the legislation. 
In its campaign, the pilots group is seeking to distinguish itself from the corporate-jet world, which is represented by the National Business Aviation Association and has a separate advertising effort under way. In some ads, the pilots group features small-business owners and doctors to emphasize the importance of general aviation to the economy and humanitarian efforts. 
"It's a positive message," said AOPA President Craig Fuller. "We're not attacking anybody." 
The general-aviation industry is struggling with layoffs at aircraft makers and suppliers, a long-term decline in certified pilots and a number of potentially costly legislative and regulatory proposals. The industry is also worried about a potential backlash against the use of private jets by business executives.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC's push to become a world leader in the technology to capture and store carbon dioxide has hit a snag in the Netherlands, where locals are trying to block the company's plan to bury CO2 under their town. 
The idea of stripping CO2 from the emissions of coal-fired power plants and other big polluters and injecting it deep underground is seen as a crucial weapon in the battle against climate change. But the technical and economic hurdles are immense, and it has never been tested on a commercial scale. 
The case of the Dutch town of Barendrecht shows there are other obstacles, too -- grass-roots opposition from locals who say it's unsafe. 
Shell's plan is designed to reduce emissions from its Pernis oil refinery near the port of Rotterdam. Already, the company diverts some of Pernis's CO2 to nearby greenhouses and the local soft-drinks industry. Its aim is to pipe the rest to Barendrecht, 17 kilometers to the south, where it would be injected into two nearly exhausted gas fields operated by NAM, a joint venture between Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp. The Dutch government says it will allocate $39.2 million to the project if it gets the go-ahead. 
Barendrecht is a small-scale demonstration project. Initially, Shell will pump only about 400,000 metric tons of CO2 a year into its gas fields, or about 0.2% of the Netherlands' total annual emissions of the pollutant. But with lots of aging natural-gas reservoirs coming to the end of their productive life, the Netherlands has vast potential for carbon storage. Shell says Barendrecht should lay the foundation for an industry that could sequester about 30 million tons of CO2 a year by 2020. 
Success is also crucial for Shell's public image. The Anglo-Dutch energy company came under fire from environmentalists last month when it said it no longer planned big investments in wind and solar energy. 
But Shell failed to account for local opposition. The company drew up an environmental-impact assessment for the project earlier this year and put it up for public consultation. Some 1,300 locals raised objections to the plan. Last month, the town council came out against it, citing "numerous reservations." 
"It's not just Nimby-ism," said Anne-Marie van het Erve, a spokeswoman for Barendrecht's council, using the acronym for not in my backyard. "A large part of the carbon-storage technology is unproved. And we're saying if it's an experiment, you shouldn't be doing it in an urban environment." 
Council members argue that Barendrecht, located in one of the most densely populated, built-up parts of Europe, is already playing host to a number of big infrastructure projects, and there's only so much it can take. Ms. Van het Erve said locals also fear a catastrophic leak or explosion of gas. 
The council's objections have been submitted to an independent commission, which is due to give its verdict later this week. Shell, which is backed by the Dutch government, is confident it will get a green light. "We say look at the facts and the risk analysis and you'll see that it's safe," said Wim van de Wiel, a Shell spokesman.

World News: Group Urges Beijing To Cut Coal Emissions

Abstract 
Developed countries participating in the United Nations' Kyoto Protocol on global warming have already accepted national caps on greenhouse-gas emissions, requiring industries that pollute more to buy so-called carbon credits. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- The International Energy Agency warned that China must clean up its coal sector or face dire environmental consequences for itself and the world. 
The Paris-based body outlined steps to mitigate pollution in China, including tougher enforcement of regulations, more foreign investment in energy, and putting a price on carbon emissions. 
"Without strong action, CO2 emissions could rise in an unsustainable way," IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said at a launch of a report on clean coal technology in China. The report was done in cooperation with the Chinese government, reflecting growing awareness in Beijing of the hazards posed by current energy trends. 
The IEA's list of recommendations included calls for greater openness of China's domestic energy sector to outside investment, and a continued pursuit of new technologies to capture carbon emissions from power plants and sequester them in the ground or elsewhere. China has said it is making cleaning up its coal-fired power sector a priority and has implemented reforms, such as shutting hundreds of small and inefficient power plants, and instituting national energy-efficiency standards. 
But Mr. Tanaka also suggested that China will have to eventually charge for carbon emissions -- a move Beijing has vigorously resisted out of fears it could stymie economic growth. Making companies pay for how much carbon they produce could be a part of setting national limits on emissions. 
"Ultimately, a market in which emissions of carbon are priced will emerge," Mr. Tanaka said. "I see that a debate is taking place in China about how quickly China should move in that direction." 
Developed countries participating in the United Nations' Kyoto Protocol on global warming have already accepted national caps on greenhouse-gas emissions, requiring industries that pollute more to buy so-called carbon credits. 
China has no national limits on carbon emissions. It has earned billions of dollars through the Kyoto plan because companies in developed countries can invest in pollution-reduction programs in China in exchange for credits to apply to their emissions back home. 
China has surpassed the U.S. as the world's leading source of global-warming greenhouse gases. That status is the byproduct of roaring economic growth that has lifted millions from poverty, but relied heavily on coal as the primary source of energy.

Abstract 
[...] please note that the bill never once uses the word nuclear. 

Full Text 
It's no surprise that the climate bill offered by Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey ("Henry Waxman Has a Plan. . . ," Review & Outlook, April 10) contains all manner of lifestyle management minutiae. The two congressmen have had more than 30 years in the House to fine tune their lifestyle ideas for Americans. 
The pair have been waiting for an opportunity to push through a more intrusive Carter administration energy-plan sequel, cleverly recycling the original "20% renewables in 2000" broken promise into a new "25% in 2025" unachievable commitment. (Look for a "50% in 2050" pledge from a future Democratic administration after the 2025 hoax is revealed.) Other key changes from the 1979 version include: thousands of invasive regulations and product mandates in place of Mr. Carter's suggestions to turn thermostats down and wear very heavy sweaters; a cap-and-trade revenue windfall instead of the Carter oil company windfall profits tax (they could have had both this time if not for the unfortunate collapse in oil prices); and a global warming rationale instead of the 1970s global ice-age climate threat du jour. 
Democrats accuse the GOP of wanting to tell Americans what they can do in the privacy of their own bedrooms. If Messrs. Waxman and Markey have their way, Democratic environmental enforcers will be telling us what we can do in every nook and cranny of our homes, including our showers and toilets. Light bulbs apparently aren't the only things that dim after 30 years in Washington; time to change some of those Carter-era bulbs. 
Lynne Beck 
New Canaan, Conn. 
If the simple fact that the proposed legislation contains 648 pages isn't proof enough of its intrusiveness and wrong-headedness, let me cite just a few of the gems tucked into this "discussion draft." 
Your editorial notes the proposal demands that 25% of all electricity be generated from renewable resources by 2025, starting at 6% in just three years. You did not note, however, that a supplier of electricity generated solely from nuclear power also must meet these renewable percentages even though a nuclear plant does not emit a single pound of carbon dioxide. 
The proposal unabashedly bans new coal-fired electric plants. In 2009 new coal-fueled electric plants are limited to 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (MWh) and 800 pounds after 2020. Present fossil-fuel electric plants emit the following pounds of CO2 per MWh: 2100 for coal, 1900 for oil, and 1300 for natural gas. It's unbelievable. The bill that includes "security" in its title limits our plentiful secure coal supply to discharges of about one-half that allowed for oil and natural gas. 
Finally, please note that the bill never once uses the word nuclear. We get 20% of our electricity from nuclear plants and France, the darling of many liberals, gets 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Nuclear energy doesn't generate even a single pound of carbon dioxide and is fully developed. 
The bottom line is that the Waxman-Markey proposal is not about global warming or energy security. It is solely about subjugating a population. Shame on us if we let that happen. 
Michael A. Petronino 
Stratford, Conn. 
Reps. Waxman and Markey's 648-page "discussion draft" of the climate bill with its descriptions of permitted light bulbs is so complex, confusing and impossible to understand, let alone implement without breaking some regulation, that it will make the old central planning of the Soviet Gosplan seem like a back of the envelope outline by comparison.

Abstract 
The push to address climate change was given new urgency Friday, when the Obama administration ruled that greenhouse gases "endanger public health" and said that unless Congress acts, new regulations would be forthcoming. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Shortly after Congress returns from recess Monday, lawmakers will have to choose which Obama promise to make a higher priority -- overhauling the health­care system or addressing climate change. 
A growing number of Democratic lawmakers prefer health care, saying that has a far greater chance of producing consensus than climate change, inside the party and across party lines. And they argue that it would be a more tangible accomplishment to present to financially stressed voters heading into the 2010 midterm elections. 
"Moving forward on health-care reform should be first among equals," Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) said in an interview. Mr. Van Hollen, a member of the House leadership team, said the House will also "make substantial progress" on climate change, including consideration of a cap-and-trade plan to control harmful emissions. But he stressed health care has the best prospect for enactment. "That is in a position to move through the entire process first," he said. 
Health care "is a way of delivering major good news to voters," added Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.), a top leader in the Blue Dogs, a group of moderate Democrats. 
The White House and Democratic congressional leaders say both issues remain at the top of their agenda. Mr. Obama looks "forward to working with [the] leadership on Capitol Hill in the months to come on both issues," said White House spokesman Jen Psaki. 
The push to address climate change was given new urgency Friday, when the Obama administration ruled that greenhouse gases "endanger public health" and said that unless Congress acts, new regulations would be forthcoming. In response, business groups said they would push for a new law from Capitol Hill, preferring that to potentially more costly emissions rules from the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Both issues are complex and politically difficult, and Capitol Hill has rarely completed landmark legislation on two fronts in one year. With four months gone in 2009 and the 2010 election looming, the window for substantive legislative action will narrow sharply. 
Beyond those measures, Democrats have a long to-do list. They still have to conclude action on the fiscal 2010 budget. They face fights over the next round of funding for the U.S.-led wars abroad as well as congressional demands to set benchmarks for progress in Afghanistan. Complex legislation is also moving that would overhaul regulation of financial markets. 
Mr. Cooper said health care is ripe for action in part because Congress has already had extensive debates on the issue, going back to the failed Clinton effort in 1994. "You don't have to start from scratch," he said, suggesting that climate change is relatively new to voters and would have a big impact on the economy -- and consumers -- while not producing an immediate benefit for voters. "Climate change doesn't have a lot of great news in it," he said. 
House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) is vowing to have a climate-change bill ready for floor action by Memorial Day. He has unveiled a draft that would control greenhouse gases by capping harmful emissions and creating a trading system that helps corporations comply with the limits. His panel will convene several hearings on the issue this week, and a key subcommittee will take up the bill in the last week of the month. 
Republicans are attacking the initiative as a tax on consumers, who would face greater energy costs. More problematic, Democrats are divided, especially in the Senate, with manufacturing and coal-state lawmakers resisting aggressive action. 
Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said climate change and health care remain "high priorities." But he looks at the political landscape and sees stronger interest in health care. "If you had to rank them, health care is probably a little bit higher," he said. 
While health care may have a smoother path than climate change, even that won't be easy, with many details remaining to be worked out. Among them: how to pay for expanded coverage, which is estimated to cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years.

Abstract 
Some Republicans and business groups that have long blocked action on climate-change legislation shifted positions in response, saying Congress now must act on legislation that would give businesses more flexibility in meeting emissions targets than rules issued under the Clean Air Act.

Corrections & Amplifications 
The U.S. emitted greenhouse gases equivalent to 631.9 metric tons of carbon dioxide per $1 million of gross domestic product in 2007. In a chart that accompanied a page-one 
article Saturday on the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that warming gases pose a threat, emissions were incorrectly labeled in billions of metric tons. 
(WSJ April 21, 2009) 
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration declared Friday that carbon dioxide and five other industrial emissions threaten the planet. The landmark decision lays the 

groundwork for federal efforts to cap carbon emissions -- at a potential cost of billions of dollars to businesses and government. 

The Environmental Protection Agency finding that the emissions endanger "the health and welfare of current and future generations" is "the first formal recognition by the U.S. 
government of the threats posed by climate change," EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wrote in a memo to her staff. 
The finding could touch every corner of Americans' lives, from the types of cars they drive to the homes they build. Along with carbon dioxide, the EPA named methane, nitrous 

oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride as deleterious to the environment. Even if the agency doesn't use its powers under the Clean Air Act to curb 

greenhouse gases, Friday's action improves the chances that Congress will move to create a more flexible mechanism to do so. 
On a conference call Friday with environmentalists, EPA officials stressed they would take a go-slow approach, holding two public hearings next month before the findings are 
official. After that, any new regulations would go through a public comment period, more hearings and a long review. 

"Whatever the process it, it will be the time-honored and ordinary process of soliciting public input," an EPA official said. 

New regulations driven by the finding could be years away. But unless superseded by congressional action, the EPA ruling eventually could lead to stricter emissions limits. 
Businesses that stand to be affected range from power plants and oil refineries to car makers and cement producers. 
Uncertainty about the impact of such regulation is already affecting some companies. Consol Energy Inc., a big coal and energy company based in Pittsburgh, says it is delaying 

two large mining projects in Northern Appalachia because of uncertainty around pending carbon emission regulation. 
"In terms of starting to move dirt, we would postpone that until there's some clarity," said Thomas Hoffman, vice president of investor relations. 
Friday's announcement marks a significant turn in U.S. policy on climate change. The U.S. has never ratified the Kyoto climate treaty. President Bill Clinton, who signed the pact, 

didn't submit it to the Senate for ratification because of strong opposition to the deal, which didn't impose greenhouse gas limits on China and other developing economies. President George W. Bush also didn't submit the Kyoto treaty for ratification, and largely resisted calls for stronger action on climate change, including the endangerment finding. 
That approach began to crumble two years ago, when the Supreme Court found that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and declared that the EPA can regulate 
it. 
With Friday's finding, the U.S. takes a big step closer to European Union nations, which have agreed to Kyoto greenhouse gas limits and are pushing for a new treaty on climate 
change at a December meeting in Copenhagen. 

Some Republicans and business groups that have long blocked action on climate-change legislation shifted positions in response, saying Congress now must act on legislation that would give businesses more flexibility in meeting emissions targets than rules issued under the Clean Air Act. 
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), a co-author of sweeping climate change legislation, called the EPA's decision "a game changer." 
"It's now no longer a choice between doing a bill or doing nothing," said the lawmaker, who will hold four days of climate change hearings next week before the formal drafting 
of a bill begins the last week of April. "It is now a choice between regulation and legislation." 

Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, sought a middle ground, proposing to focus carbon caps on coal-fired power plants and vehicle tailpipes -- and holding off any move until the nation emerges from recession. 
American Electric Power, a utility giant with 5.2 million customers in states from Texas to Michigan to Virginia, is already considering what coal plants would have to be shuttered and how high rates would have to go to comply with either a regulatory or legislative mandates to curb carbon dioxide. AEP spokesman Pat Hemlepp said rate increases stretch from 25% to 50% and beyond, depending on the climate change strategy that finally emerges from Washington. 
A proposal by President Barack Obama would cap the emissions of greenhouse gases, then force polluters to purchase emission permits, which could be traded on the open market. The details of the cost of carbon credits have been left to Congress, although Mr. Obama has said he wants all emissions covered, with no allowance for free emissions, as some business groups and lawmakers want. 
Heavy carbon emitters, such as utilities that rely on coal-fired power, would pay a hefty price, but the cost of compliance would be alleviated by purchasing extra emissions permits from companies that emit less or can more easily adapt with energy-saving technology. 
Regulation, on the other hand, would probably exclude such flexibility, and simply force businesses to reduce emissions. Businesses also see a more favorable playing field in Congress than with EPA regulators, who do not have to face the voters. 
"We're pretty confident that Congress is going to be much more sensitive to the economic impact of this than some unelected bureaucrats," said Hank Cox, a spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers. 
The impact of the EPA finding could be dramatic. Using the Clean Air Act, the EPA could raise fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, such as by authorizing nationwide adoption of California's rules for greenhouse-gas tailpipe emissions. 
That could require auto makers to produce more hybrid and electric vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid under development by General Motors Corp. The Volt, however, is expected to carry a sticker of about $40,000, or roughly twice the price of a conventional Chevrolet Malibu sedan. 
In electric power, the EPA could force new power plants to include emissions-reduction technology, although it is unclear whether emerging technologies to capture carbon-dioxide emissions would be feasible. 
The EPA could order older power plants to be retrofitted, such as with more-efficient boilers, and it could mandate more reliance on wind and other renewable energy if coal-fired power plants can't be made to run more cleanly. That could present technological and infrastructure challenges. 
White House officials made clear Friday that President Obama prefers a legislative approach to curbing global warming. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold hearings next week on an Obama proposal to cap carbon emissions and sell tradable permits that businesses must buy to emit carbon dioxide. The White House will dispatch senior officials to those hearings, an official said. 
The EPA finding comes about two years after the Supreme Court found that carbon dioxide is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA can regulate it.

Abstract 
"Members of Congress are looking at a variety of policy options to help us make that transition, and the administration will be flexible during the policy-making process as long as those larger goals" of a clean-energy economy, "green" job creation and cutting oil imports are met, he said in an email. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The White House is open to compromise on certain key elements of its climate-change agenda, including whether businesses could get some emissions allowances for free, administration officials said Wednesday. 
"[The president's] preferred approach was 100% auction to create incentives for companies to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions," said White House spokesman Ben LaBolt. "Members of Congress are looking at a variety of policy options to help us make that transition, and the administration will be flexible during the policy-making process as long as those larger goals" of a clean-energy economy, "green" job creation and cutting oil imports are met, he said in an email. 
Many lawmakers have warned that passing a climate bill will be difficult if the administration sticks to a position that all of the greenhouse-gas emissions allowances under a so-called cap-and-trade system would have to be purchased at auction. Recent Senate votes have indicated that proponents of an economy-wide cap and trade proposal don't yet have the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. 
"The road to success is 60 votes [in the Senate], and so we want to make sure that we're able to address as many members' needs as possible to try to get there," Joseph Aldy, special assistant to the president for energy and the environment, said at an energy conference here Wednesday. 
President Barack Obama last month backed away from pressing for 100% auction of emission credits, telling the Business Roundtable that it wasn't politically feasible. The president's science adviser said in an interview with the Washington Post Wednesday that a climate bill didn't necessarily have to start with 100% auction, but could work its way there over time. 
Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, last week unveiled a 648-page draft climate change and energy bill that will likely become the blueprint for congressional and administration policy efforts. Congressional debate on the Waxman bill and other proposals is expected to begin in earnest when lawmakers return from a break the week of April 20. 
Mr. Aldy said the administration had reached out to moderate Democrats in the Senate who have expressed reservations about current proposals to cap greenhouse- gas emissions. Nearly a dozen lawmakers from states with heavier reliance on coal-fired power plants and energy-intensive industries last year blocked a more lenient climate proposal in the Senate. 
Many of those same senators have written to Mr. Obama warning against trying to push a bill with 100% auction and outlining some of their concerns. Legislators are concerned that auctioning off so many credits would cost industries too much, and they want a larger portion of the revenue funneled into low-carbon energy technologies and energy-intensive sectors. 
In the president's fiscal 2010 budget, the administration proposed cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 83% from 2005 levels by 2050, and auctioning off all of the credits that give the holder the right to emit gases such as carbon dioxide. 
Mr. Obama proposed distributing most of the revenue gathered in the auction as tax credits to lower-income households, while siphoning off a fraction to fund clean energy technologies.

Abstract 
Acting like a giant mirror, the Arctic sea ice helps cool the planet by reflecting solar radiation back into space. 

Full Text 
A decade-long decline in the ice covering the Arctic Sea is continuing, according to new U.S. data, and other measurements give fresh indications that the area's ice cap is thinning as well. 
Acting like a giant mirror, the Arctic sea ice helps cool the planet by reflecting solar radiation back into space. When there is less sea ice, the dark, open water absorbs more of the sun's warmth and raises the temperature of both air and water -- thereby affecting the climate. 
How the sea-ice cover changes -- in both summer and winter -- has become a hot topic for policy makers. The Arctic melt is already affecting tourism, shipping and trade routes. It has persuaded several countries to push for territorial claims in newly accessible regions of the Arctic. 
The latest figures were released the same day that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton opened a U.S.-hosted summit in Baltimore, which brings together two diplomatic bodies that govern the Arctic and Antarctic. The Obama administration is arguing for more restrictions on polar tourism to protect the fragile environment. 
Scientists calculate that thicker ice that is two or more years old now makes up less than 10% of the Arctic's wintertime ice cover, about one-third the average levels seen annually from 1981 to 2000, according to a study reported Monday by a team of scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder. That is equivalent to a decline of 278,000 square miles of ice, a surface area larger than Texas. 
Equally troubling to some scientists is that the overall Arctic ice cap is thinning. That has been hard to measure in the past because the Arctic is vast, and because sea ice can move. 
Scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., have now used satellite data to create the first map of sea ice over the entire Arctic basin. Their chief finding, based on data from 2005 and 2006, is that older arctic ice is on average nearly nine feet thick. Submarine measurements from the 1980s found that the ice then had been more than 41/2 feet thicker, according to Ronald Kwok of NASA's Jet Propulsion lab. 
"The sea-ice changes we're seeing go hand-in-hand with temperature changes," says Walt Meier of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. "There really isn't another overriding mechanism we see that can cause these long-term changes." 
Concern over the polar environment comes amid a tussle in the U.S. over climate change. President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have said they want a cap on greenhouse-gas emissions -- a departure from the policy of the Bush administration. Last week,, two House Democrats, Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, introduced a bill to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, a bigger cut than Mr. Obama has called for in the same period. 
Either way, the proposals represent only opening salvos in the political fight. Politicians from states that depend for most of their electricity on burning coal, which emits large amounts of greenhouse gases, already are warning that a severe emissions cap could significantly raise energy prices. 
Given that debate, it is unclear whether the U.S. will have a climate proposal with broad political support by the time diplomats from around the world meet in December in Copenhagen to discuss a new international climate-change treaty.

Abstract 
A November 2008 study by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change forecasts the international costs could be as much as $3 trillion by 2050 for developing nations to make the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are necessary. 

Full Text 
Last summer, China and the developing world announced the price for their cooperation on a global-warming treaty: up to 1% of the developed world's gross domestic product. For the U.S., this would mean sending $140 billion a year to China, Iran, North Korea and Cuba, among other countries. This is in addition to the $28 billion we already distribute each year in foreign aid. 
For a U.S. family of four, China's demand comes to nearly $1,900 in yearly taxes. And that's just the beginning. 
The tenor of international climate negotiations has emboldened the Indian government to claim in a February filing with the United Nations that the West owes it billions of dollars in compensation for climate change. These payments, it said, should be mandatory and not "subject to decisions of developed country governments and legislatures." 
A November 2008 study by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change forecasts the international costs could be as much as $3 trillion by 2050 for developing nations to make the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are necessary. The MIT report says that the U.S. share would total nearly $1 trillion of these "international financial transfers of unprecedented scale." 
President Barack Obama recently unveiled a budget blueprint that called for a $646 billion climate tax through a carbon-trading system. Already, White House officials are saying this tax could be three times larger. That means a family of four could have to shell out nearly $45,000 in climate taxes during the coming decade. 
For beleaguered U.S. taxpayers in a troubled economy, these numbers are disastrous. 
The U.S. cannot reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere without the developing nations cutting their emissions as well. A 2007 study by the Battelle Memorial Institute found that if China, India and the other developing countries keep growing at current rates, they will emit nearly three times as much carbon dioxide as will the developed countries by the end of this century. But will China and India join in the effort to reduce CO2 emissions? 
During December's U.N. climate-change conference in Poznan, Poland, I asked delegates from both of these nations if they would agree to cut their emissions. Both said, unequivocally, "no." 
The Poznan conference wasn't my first experience with the developing world's refusal to sign up for the West's global-warming agenda. I led the congressional delegation to the infamous Kyoto, Japan, negotiations in 1997, and the story then was the same as now. Without China and India, there can be no deal. 
It's understandable why the developing nations are reluctant to cut emissions -- it means higher energy costs and reduced growth. China and India are more concerned with growing their economy, expanding access to electricity, and reducing poverty. I don't blame them. 
U.S. policy makers should remember the nation's experience with the financial bailout before sending blank checks abroad. Lawmakers will find themselves at a loss to explain to taxpayers how the U.S. paid billions of dollars to China and India only to fund the very coal-fired power plants that are among the worst emitters of greenhouse gases. Giving away money with the hope that it will be spent properly is wishful thinking. China has requested 1% of the developed world's GDP, but will it agree on how to spend it? 
This week, negotiators are meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the next round of climate talks. The direction of these talks must change from the current path that is promising high costs and few guarantees. 
Yvo de Boer, the United Nations climate chief, said last month that the developed world needs "to set out how it will meet its fair share of financial obligations and shed some light on how it will mobilize those resources." Before we ask how we will "mobilize resources," policy makers should know how these resources will be spent. 
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Congress on March 17 that researchers must make "breakthrough" technological advances if greenhouse-gas reduction goals are to be met. He is right. Global energy demands are going to rise. Development and implementation of new technologies are the only way to control emissions when they do. 
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions isn't about massive federal spending and transfers of wealth to the developing nations. It's about developing cost-effective technologies that reduce emissions. Federal policy should focus on encouraging these technologies, not meeting demands for additional foreign aid. 
Mr. Sensenbrenner (R., Wisc.), is the ranking minority member of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.

The modern environmental movement is having an identity crisis. Staring down its biggest enemy yet, it's fiercely divided over how to beat it. 
The global challenge of climate change is tougher than the localized problems the green movement has spent decades fighting. To some environmentalists, it requires chucking old orthodoxies and getting practical. To others, it demands an old-style moral crusade. 
The pragmatists have the upper hand. One sign is that the movement is moving beyond small-scale backyard wind turbines and rooftop solar panels. It's calling for technological change at industrial speed and scale -- sometimes to the detriment of local ecologies. 
In Europe, environmental groups are backing proposals for massive collections of wind turbines off the continent's Atlantic coast that would amount to seaborne power plants. In California, they're endorsing huge solar-panel installations on farmland and in the desert. In Washington, they're lobbying for more spending to develop "clean coal," resigned to the conclusion that scrubbing coal is more plausible than killing it. 
"There's a kind of reality check," says Stephan Singer, the Brussels-based director of global energy policy for WWF, an environmental group also called the World Wildlife Fund. The only clean-energy options likely to matter are "large, centralized solutions," he says. "That's the way it is." 
Karen Douglas feels the pressure from both sides of the divide. She has spent her career as a green activist in California, and her success has helped move her from outside agitator to inside policy maker. After California passed a law curbing greenhouse-gas emissions, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tapped Ms. Douglas early last year to join the California Energy Commission, which has to help figure out how to comply with the law. Recently, she was named chairman. 
The commission is trying to figure out where big new solar-energy installations and electric-transmission lines should go. The process is pitting locally oriented environmentalists, whose priority still is to protect California's wilderness, against globally oriented environmentalists whose focus is to get big renewable-energy projects built. "I am in an interesting spot," she says. "It's hard." 
Mr. Singer of the WWF is in a similar fix. In Europe, the prospect of large-scale renewable energy means the construction of hundreds of wind turbines off the coast. His organization "strongly supports" that move, he says, despite opposition from some local environmentalists who contend such installations might harm birds or fish. 
"We all grew up with this kind of mantra that small is beautiful," he says. But that "is not a model for a highly modernized, global world." 
Nothing underscores the green movement's soul-searching more than its conflicted view of coal, which provides about half the world's electricity. Should society pour billions of dollars into trying to perfect a way to turn coal into electricity without emitting greenhouse gases? Or should it reject coal as inalterably dirty and try to replace it entirely with renewable sources like the wind and sun? 
Late last year, the influential Natural Resources Defense Council helped sponsor ads ridiculing coal-industry ads boasting about progress toward cleaning up coal. "In reality, there's no such thing as clean coal," said a print version of the ad. 
But last month, the NRDC, along with the Environmental Defense Fund, another prominent group, hosted workshops advocating more spending on clean-coal research. The rationale: Coal will remain a crucial fuel for decades, so it makes sense to try to clean it up. 
"If NRDC had written all the ads by itself, we probably would have had a more nuanced ad," says NRDC climate expert David Hawkins. "But it probably would have been a nuanced ad that doesn't get noticed." 
Industry claims that coal already is clean are "misleading," says Mr. Hawkins. Still, the technology to generate electricity from coal and capture the carbon-dioxide emissions "is both needed and feasible," he says. That was the point of the workshops, he says: that government should implement policies to deploy the technology. 
Now, a backlash is building within the movement. Rather than push certain technological fixes, critics say, environmentalists should simply push government to slap industry with a tough cap on greenhouse gases -- and let industry figure out how to meet the mandate. 
"It's like we're pushing to invent a better cotton gin as a way to reduce slaveholding instead of just banning slaveholding," says the Environmental Defense Fund's John DeCicco. "The environmental movement has become insiders. Is that actually to our benefit now? Or is that to our detriment?"

Abstract 
The more-than-600-page document published by Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) represents the opening bid by the party's liberal leaders in the House in what promises to be a long struggle with more moderate Senate Democrats and Republicans over how to curb emissions, and whether to do it in the middle of a recession. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The debate in Washington over climate change shifted into higher gear Tuesday as powerful California Democrat Henry Waxman introduced a bill to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, but without specifying how the costs would be levied on different sectors of the economy. 
The more-than-600-page document published by Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) represents the opening bid by the party's liberal leaders in the House in what promises to be a long struggle with more moderate Senate Democrats and Republicans over how to curb emissions, and whether to do it in the middle of a recession. 
The Waxman-Markey proposal represents another big piece in a complex energy strategy that Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies are pushing through legislation, budget priorities and policies being set by regulatory agencies. 
Mr. Obama wants to put a price on emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change, in part to spur development in the U.S. of new power-generation technology, more efficient cars and buildings that consume less energy. Mr. Obama has argued this serves two goals: curbing climate change, and creating new "green" jobs. Mr. Obama has directed billions of dollars in new federal spending to renovate the electric grid, the better to carry power generated by windmills. He has called for more federal support for research into energy-saving technology, and has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider letting states regulate automobile emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. 
But the key to all of Mr. Obama's initiatives is raising the cost of burning fossil fuels, which provide the majority of the U.S. economy's electric and transportation energy -- a politically challenging endeavor even in good economic times. 
Those risks were underscored by Republican attacks Tuesday on the Waxman-Markey bill. The proposal would "raise taxes on every American who drives a car, flips on a light switch, or buys a product manufactured in the United States," House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio said in a statement. 
The Waxman-Markey bill calls for cutting U.S. emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, compared with the roughly 14% reduction that Mr. Obama has called for in that time frame. It would also mandate tougher efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, and require that by 2025, the U.S. derive at least 25% of its electricity from renewable sources. 
But the measure -- which its authors described as a "discussion draft" -- avoids specifying how the costs of fighting climate change will be distributed across the economy. For example, the measure would establish a so-called cap-and-trade system, which would limit the overall amount of carbon dioxide companies are allowed to emit and would let companies buy permits giving giving them the right to pollute if they can't cut their emissions by the required amount. But the proposal doesn't spell out the percentage of those permits that would be given away for free, versus being sold at auctions by the government. 
Lobbyists for industries that depend heavily on cheap fossil-fuel power, such as cement, steel and coal-fired electric plants, say any U.S. regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions should include a giveaway of some emissions allowances, to give the companies time to work on new technology. 
Mr. Obama's aides say that would lead to windfall profits for some companies. His administration has called for auctioning off 100% of the emission allowances and using the bulk of the revenue -- roughly $645 billion between 2012, when the system kicks in, and 2019 -- to fund tax credits for the middle class. 
The Waxman-Markey proposal calls for an unspecified amount of emissions permits to be given away for free to certain trade-sensitive U.S. industries, to ease their costs of compliance.

Abstract 
J. Wayne Leonard, chairman and CEO of Entergy Corp., one of the largest U.S. energy companies and the No. 2 generator of nuclear power, is no stranger to the many contradictions of American energy policy. The avuncular Mr. Leonard, who lives in Lousiana, made his name in nuclear, and over the last nine years as Entergy CEO he has achieved the highest total shareholder return in the nuclear power industry. 

Full Text 
Washington -- On the one hand, environmentalists claim that climate change is a "planetary emergency," perhaps the greatest threat ever to face humanity. On the other, nuclear energy is still verboten in the green catechism -- despite the fact that it provides roughly one-fifth of U.S. electricity, all of it free of carbon emissions. And without more nuclear power, it is nearly impossible to see even the glimmers of any low-emission future. 
J. Wayne Leonard, chairman and CEO of Entergy Corp., one of the largest U.S. energy companies and the No. 2 generator of nuclear power, is no stranger to the many contradictions of American energy policy. "Everybody's gums are still bleeding from the '70s," he says of nuclear power, noting that today's technology is far superior to its Three Mile Island vintage. 
The avuncular Mr. Leonard, who lives in Lousiana, made his name in nuclear, and over the last nine years as Entergy CEO he has achieved the highest total shareholder return in the nuclear power industry. But now his thoughts are concentrated on more lasting matters -- namely, his deep-seated concern about climate change. 
Does he think nuclear energy has a larger role to play in that effort? 
"Is it nuclear?" Mr. Leonard asks in Entergy's D.C. office. "Are you really going to mandate nuclear? I don't think so. I mean, mandate private businesses at the kind of prices we're taking about, and the kind of risks? That's pretty tough to do. You'd have to turn all of us into France" -- 79% of its electricity is nuclear -- "and have a government-sponsored program. I don't see that as consistent with what made this country into what it is today." 
Mr. Leonard thinks like an economist. He talks about "efficiency" and "maximizing consumer surplus" the same way other utility executives talk about rate schedules and voltage. The most important thing the government can do on climate change, in Mr. Leonard's estimation, is to change the incentives for producing -- or, not producing -­carbon. His answer on the role of nuclear was revealing about his mentality: Set the price, and market forces, not government, will make the decisions. 
"We see ourselves as a market economy, and that's created great wealth for society over time," he says, "but we're a market economy that doesn't have price signals for CO2." 
Entergy belongs to the swarm of major energy companies that are -- contrary to type -- practically begging Washington to create a cap-and-trade program. Mr. Leonard supports President Barack Obama's plan to slash emissions 80% by 2050. It sounds strange: Lobbying the government to tax your products is generally not taught in business school. 
But then, a lot of companies stand to make a bundle off cap and trade. Once Congress puts a ceiling on emissions, and then allows businesses to sell any of its extra allowances that stand for the right to emit, it is essentially creating the world's largest commodity market -- in carbon-backed securities. These will be extremely valuable, and everything comes down to how the government chooses to distribute them. 
Mr. Leonard thinks the allowances should be auctioned off, rather than given away. So does the White House. Then the billions in new revenues that cap and trade would raise every year should be returned to the public. "Ideally you want to recycle it all, give all the money back," he says. 
That's the purist's view on cap and trade -- and it puts him at odds with many of his peers at big coal-fired utilities like Duke Energy and American Electric Power that emit the most carbon. These companies signed on in the expectation that the allowances would be handed out at no charge. But economically, that is the same as selling them and giving the money to businesses -- i.e., as subsidies and corporate welfare. Mr. Leonard uses more diplomatic language: "Everybody's got their kind of own self-interest out there that they're tending to promote, once you get behind it." 
It would be fair here to note Entergy's own self-interest: Only about 7% of its portfolio is coal, and the nuclear industry stands to benefit as much as any "green" business from a carbon crackdown. Then again, if Congress does create cap and trade, expect the next populist outcry to be for a windfall profits tax on nuclear. 
Mr. Leonard acknowledges, though, that coal and other energy companies -- and their customers -- have legitimate reasons to worry about cap and trade: "No utility CEO likes to raise rates, and that's what would happen. Your rates go up no matter what," he says. And even if the government returns every dime of climate revenues to ratepayers, "That's a painful thing for utilities to have to endure, because angriness comes toward you, and somebody else gets the goodwill." Giving out the allowances, he does concede, could help the cushion the blow. 
On pure economic grounds, Mr. Leonard seems to prefer a straight carbon tax, which would be simpler and more efficient than cap and trade. But he also notes that "the political will to go the tax route . . . is just not there. Nonexistent" -- namely because the use of the word "tax." The key, he says, is to design a cap-and-trade program that will "simulate the same thing a tax would do." That is, to achieve the increased energy prices essential to the success of cap and trade. 
Mr. Leonard does evince a certain . . . uneasiness with the direction of climate politics. "The old adage of 'think globally, act locally' -- it still works," he says. "But with climate change, for it to really be effective, we have to take that thought much more completely and much more deeply than probably we've ever really thought about an issue." 
He notes China's breakneck construction of conventional coal plants. China has already surpassed U.S. coal capacity and is on pace to double it sometime in the middle of the next decade. The U.S., he says, could close down every single coal plant immediately and that would be "working to a global solution, acting locally. But that wouldn't do much good in the scheme of things," because atmospheric CO2 concentrations would continue to rise as China continues to expand. 
"We go to zero emissions in this country, and if China doesn't follow us, we're nowhere. . . . We've just ruined our economy, and we're nowhere," Mr. Leonard says. "We make mistakes here," meaning a poorly designed carbon system, "and we have a real problem." He goes on, "We talk about that we should lead, then people will follow, but that's kind of" -- he pauses -- "silly. China's not going to follow us because we're the United States. . . . You say, 'Shut down your plants' -- well, that's going to be a short conversation. They've got $2 trillion invested in their plants and they still aren't feeding all their people." He adds that "If we were China, we wouldn't shut our plants down either." 
Mr. Leonard argues that the best way to square these circles is to channel U.S. basic research dollars into the technology that can retrofit existing coal plants with carbon capture technology. Most current funding is devoted to second-generation systems that are still 10 or 20 years away from commercial deployment, at best. "We should spend 99% of our time on the problem that we have today, and it ain't going away," he says, referring to coal emissions. He also sees retrofit technology as a realistic way to curb Chinese emissions: "They're going to follow because we can offer them something." 
Mr. Leonard worries, too, that Congress may make matters worse as it takes up climate change legislation this spring or summer. One proposal that enjoys wide Democratic support is a "renewable portfolio standard," which would mandate that utilities generate a certain percentage of their electricity -- as high as 20% -- from renewable sources like wind or solar. Nuclear, naturally, does not qualify. 
Mr. Leonard points to yet another energy policy contradiction, which is that a portfolio standard -- which Congress would impose on top of cap and trade -- would actually increase carbon emissions. Power companies would be more likely to use renewables to replace sources like natural gas, which is relatively lower in carbon but also expensive, rather than to displace coal, which is cheaper and more abundant but also produces more emissions. 
While Mr. Leonard says -- repeatedly -- that Entergy has nothing against solar or wind, "Our view is that government shouldn't be in the business of picking technologies. . . . And we're moving down a path where we're mandating renewables instead of a price signal to do it. We're . . . moving toward a planned economy by mandating a technology. Well, if we're a planned economy, if we're mandating technologies, then we don't have a whole plan." 
"The focus," Mr. Leonard reiterates, "should be on developing the cap-and-trade program: Setting the amount of reductions, where we want to be, setting the price signal that works so that it's not so high that it shuts down coal plants prematurely, and that's not so low that it becomes a loophole and people don't end up doing anything -- and all we end up doing is taxing people, and God knows what the government will do with that money." 
"This needs to be done with a fine pen to get it right," he adds. 
Still, the government is not exactly run by omniscient technocrats. Does he believe that Congress -- with its entrenched constituencies, its own self-interest, its many antibusiness biases -- can actually create a climate system that is as sensitive and efficient as he envisions? That is, can the political class actually write the same bill that economists would write? 
"That is really the tough part," Mr. Leonard says. "The trade-offs are not simple. . . . With a well-crafted bill, the market will make those choices. Or you can do it with a planned economy, and hope you get it right." 
We may find out.

Abstract 
The crisis that erupted in the predawn hours of March 28, 1979, when a combination of worker mistakes and equipment malfunctions triggered a partial meltdown in the core of one of two reactors at a power plant near Harrisburg, Pa., was long thought to have sealed the fate of the industry in the U.S. But rising concerns about global warming have set the stage for a comeback. 

Full text 
Thirty years after the accident at Three Mile Island, the nuclear power industry is moving ahead with plans to build a string of new reactors in the U.S., though the revival faces many uncertainties. 
The crisis that erupted in the predawn hours of March 28, 1979, when a combination of worker mistakes and equipment malfunctions triggered a partial meltdown in the core of one of two reactors at a power plant near Harrisburg, Pa., was long thought to have sealed the fate of the industry in the U.S. 
But rising concerns about global warming have set the stage for a comeback. Nuclear power can generate electricity without producing the greenhouse gases associated with energy sources such as coal. 
This green dimension is a surprising shift from the past, when nuclear power was widely demonized by environmentalists, and is one reason public acceptance of the technology appears to be growing. A Gallup poll released last week found 59% of people favor its use, including 27% strongly in favor. 
The U.S. has 104 reactors from the earlier wave of construction, which generate about 20% of the nation's electricity. Utilities have applied to build 26 new reactors, often at or adjacent to existing plants, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has to approve the plans, says the first approvals could come by 2011. Given how long it takes to build a plant, the first wouldn't come on line until later in the decade. 
But the revival faces tough barriers, including high costs. Jone-Lin Wang, managing director of the global power group at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, says estimates "have gone up substantially, compared to just a few years ago." A 1,000 megawatt unit could cost $6 billion to $8 billion, she says, adding that since many plans call for building twin units as part of a single project, that could push total price tags up to $16 billion. 
"For some of the companies going through the licensing process, that's the same size as their entire market cap," she says, and it remains unclear whether they can secure financing. 
Despite these uncertainties, the industry is growing again, particularly in western Pennsylvania -- not far from Three Mile Island -- a region long associated with nuclear businesses. Larry Foulke, director of nuclear programs at the University of Pittsburgh, sees it in his classrooms: Pitt created an introductory nuclear engineering class in 2006 and expected 25 to enroll. Seventy-five signed up. For next fall's class, 104 have already pre-enrolled. 
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, which builds and maintains reactors and is now part of Japan's Toshiba Corp., added 1,400 workers last year to handle the influx of business, and says it will keep adding 650 a year for the next half a decade. 
"The recession is something everyone is paying attention to, but it doesn't seem to be having a significant impact on us," says company spokesman Vaughn Gilbert, noting that the company inked another deal in January. Westinghouse now has contracts to build six reactors in the U.S. 
It's hard to overstate the impact Three Mile Island had on the nuclear industry. Just days before the accident, the movie "The China Syndrome" opened in U.S. theaters, depicting a catastrophe at a nuclear plant. After the accident, no new applications to build nuclear plants were filed with the NRC until the recent wave began in 2007. The second reactor at the site, which was undamaged, was eventually restarted in October 1985, while the damaged reactor has remained closed. 
The accident spurred sweeping changes as companies poured money into safer designs and better safety systems. The cleanup helped spark advances in robotics technology. Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh built a series of robots to aid in the process. "There were a great deal of operational firsts that occurred with those robots, which opened the way for other working robots," says William L.

A test model of one of those machines is included with other cleanup tools in a new display at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, which is being unveiled Saturday to commemorate the anniversary. 
Ralph DeSantis, a spokesman for Exelon Corp., the utility that operates Three Mile Island, says people are coming into the industry today who weren't born when the accident occurred. "They grew up watching Homer Simpson," the cartoon character who portrays a bumbling nuclear-plant worker, "but they know it's just a cartoon." Moreover, the industry is growing, offering jobs at a time of rising unemployment.

Abstract 
According to an internal document presented by the EPA to White House officials earlier this month, the EPA believes the health effects of elevated greenhouse-gas levels could cause "severe heat waves...with likely increases in mortality and morbidity, especially among the elderly, young and frail." 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency has sent the White House a proposed finding that carbon dioxide is a danger to public health, a step that could trigger a clampdown on emissions of greenhouse gases across a wide swath of the economy. 
If approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget, the endangerment finding could clear the way for the EPA to use the Clean Air Act to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases believed to contribute to climate change. In effect, the government would treat carbon dioxide as a pollutant. The EPA submitted the proposed rule to the White House on Friday, according to federal records published Monday. 
Such a finding would raise pressure on Congress to enact a system that caps greenhouse gases -- which trap the sun's heat in the earth's atmosphere -- and creates a market for businesses to buy and sell the right to emit them, as President Barack Obama has proposed. 
A White House representative said Monday that Mr. Obama's "strong preference is for Congress to pass energy security legislation that includes a cap on greenhouse-gas emissions. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must review whether greenhouse-gas emissions pose a threat to public health or welfare, and this is simply the next step in what will be a long process that engages stakeholders and the public." 
The administration has proposed a cap-and-trade system that could raise $646 billion by 2019 through government auctions of emission allowances. Environmentalists want the administration to act on climate change before December, ahead of talks aimed at forging a successor to the Koyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that commits many industrialized countries to reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions. 
EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn declined to comment on the details of the endangerment proposal, saying it is "still [an] internal and deliberative" document. But in a move that indicated the potential scope of regulation, the agency earlier this month proposed a national system for reporting carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions by major emitters. The EPA has said about 13,000 facilities, accounting for about 85% to 90% of greenhouse gases emitted in the U.S., would be covered under the proposal. 
Industry officials say it will still take months, possibly even years, for the administration to finalize rules for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. 
According to an internal document presented by the EPA to White House officials earlier this month, the EPA believes the health effects of elevated greenhouse-gas levels could cause "severe heat waves...with likely increases in mortality and morbidity, especially among the elderly, young and frail." The agency also said climate change caused by higher greenhouse-gas levels could result in more severe storms and more suffering related to "floods, storms, droughts and fires." 
Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers warn that if the EPA moves forward on regulation of CO2 under the Clean Air Act -- instead of a measured legislative approach -- it could hobble the already weak economy. 
Coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and domestic industries, such as energy-intensive paper, cement, fertilizer, steel, and glass manufacturers, worry that increased cost burdens imposed by climate-change laws will put them at a severe competitive disadvantage to their international peers that aren't bound by similar environmental rules. 
Environmentalists have called for the endangerment finding, and say action by Congress or the Obama administration to curb greenhouse gases is necessary to halt the ill effects of climate change.

Abstract 
Carbon-dioxide emissions were to be removed from the waste stream and pumped underground for permanent storage, reducing the release of greenhouse gases that are linked to climate change. 

Full Text 
The federal government is once again dangling billions of dollars for "clean coal" projects, sparking a high-stakes lobbying effort among different states trying to score some of the cash for local projects. 
The recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act designates $3.4 billion in federal funding for investment in pioneering clean-coal technology, including power plants that would capture carbon dioxide so only small amounts are released to the atmosphere. 
The Texas political establishment launched a campaign this month to press Energy Secretary Steven Chu to consider funding a project proposed by Summit Power Group for a site near Odessa, in western Texas. 
Another clean-coal project by Tenaska Inc. at a site east of Sweetwater, Texas, also is a contender. A power-plant proposal in Mattoon, Ill., which was a showcase project under a failed Bush administration clean-coal program called FutureGen, also is trying to secure financing and is backed by the Illinois congressional delegation. 
These plants would be among the most costly power projects ever constructed, more expensive even than nuclear-power plants, per unit of productive capacity. Without massive federal funding, it is unlikely that any of them would move forward. The Department of Energy has yet to detail how it would dole out the money. 
The funding comes on the heels of the FutureGen effort, which was stalled last year by then Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman when the estimated cost rose to $1.8 billion. Mr. Bodman said he thought the project had little chance of yielding results. 
The Energy Department's decision to cancel FutureGen, after many millions of dollars had been spent, was a blow to those who believed the technology would never move forward without strong federal support. 
The program was begun in 2003 with the aim of funding a power plant that would convert coal into a combustible gas, then burn it to make electricity. Carbon-dioxide emissions were to be removed from the waste stream and pumped underground for permanent storage, reducing the release of greenhouse gases that are linked to climate change. 
There is no indication that the current effort will fare any better or prove any less costly than FutureGen. However, the promise of billions of dollars in funding means these projects have attracted strong political support. 
In a letter signed by nearly 100 members of the Texas legislature, Mr. Chu was asked last week to offer federal assistance to the Odessa project. U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R., Texas) is also lobbying for the plant, as are more than two dozen members of the Texas congressional delegation. On Friday, Ms. Hutchison said the project would create badly needed jobs and was "critical for the production of clean domestic energy." 
The Odessa project had lost out under the FutureGen program when it was beaten out by the Illinois site. But its backers believe it stands a strong chance under the new program. 
At $1.6 billion, the Odessa plant would cost about 10 times as much as a modern gas-fired power plant. Summit Power Chairman Donald Hodel, formerly energy and interior secretary under President Ronald Reagan, said he expects "significant savings from each successive plant that's built." The plant's economics, he said, would be improved by cap-and-trade legislation that would raise the cost of traditional fossil-fuel generation and electricity prices, which are now very low. 
"There are a lot of moving pieces," in terms of financing, said Mr. Hodel, "but we have got to find a way to use coal in an acceptable manner."

Currents -- Power Shift: Coal Hard Facts: Cleaning It Won't Be Dirt Cheap --- The Technology to Scrub Out Carbon Dioxide Is Within Reach, but It Costs Too Much Money and Consumes Too Much Energy

Abstract 
In dueling television commercials, the power industry portrays it as a silver bullet nearly ready to be deployed, while environmental groups allied with Mr. Gore imply it's a smokescreen from a fossil-fuel industry under fire. CO2 has been shot underground for decades in places like Texas, where it is injected into aging oil and gas fields to force the remaining fossil fuel up through wells. 

Full text 
Pleasant Prairie, Wis. -- Big industry calls it the future. Al Gore suggests it's a fantasy. Whatever the truth about "clean coal," consumers will be paying for it one way or another. 
Coal, more than any other fuel, powers the planet. It is the primary source of electricity in dominant economies from the U.S. to China to Germany. In all those places, coal is cheap and, unlike oil, domestically plentiful. Its use is rising, particularly in developing countries that soon will consume more energy than the industrialized world. 
Coal's problem is that it is dirty. When burned, it spews out more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel. Globally, burning coal to make electricity is the biggest single source of man-made CO2 -- bigger than gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Governments world-wide are advocating massive cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions. It is hard to see how those cuts could materialize without clean coal. 
Clean coal refers to the idea of harnessing the black rock's energy while safely disposing of the resulting CO2 rather than sending it skyward. In dueling television commercials, the power industry portrays it as a silver bullet nearly ready to be deployed, while environmental groups allied with Mr. Gore imply it's a smokescreen from a fossil-fuel industry under fire. 
Right now, clean coal seems both possible and improbable. The basic elements of clean coal are already in use in small corners of industry. But whether it is broadly and quickly adopted around the world will depend less on science than on economics. Cleaning coal is very expensive. 
Home to one of the world's most advanced clean-coal tests, the Pleasant Prairie power plant exposes the hyperbole on both sides of the debate. Fired up three decades ago, the plant has run full-bore ever since, adapting time and again to new environmental rules and still churning out some of the cheapest energy in the nation. It burns some 13,000 tons of coal daily to produce 13% of the electricity consumed by all of Wisconsin. 
New rooms of machinery have been added to scrub a swirl of pollutants from the plant's exhaust before it is released into the air. Today, half as much space at the plant is devoted to preventing pollution as to producing power. That has slashed the plant's output of chemicals that cause respiratory disease and acid rain. But it has done nothing to trim the plant's emissions of CO2. This coal-fired power plant is cleaner than it once was, but it still isn't "clean." This plant pours out some 8.6 million tons of CO2 annually -­about as much as 1.7 million U.S. cars. 
The first step in making coal more climate-friendly is for a power plant to capture most of its CO2. A handful of plants today capture small amounts of the gas for reasons unrelated to climate change. One in Maryland, for example, sells it for making soft drinks and beer, and for freezing food. One byproduct of power generation is steam, and the federal government offers incentives to plants that make more-efficient use of it. Steam is also used to capture CO2. 
A year ago, the Pleasant Prairie plant entered this first phase with an experiment to capture its CO2. The machinery for extracting the gas here is three stories tall. But at the 425-acre plant, it seems tiny. Its pipes pull a bit of exhaust from the power plant and then remove the CO2 in a process that involves mixing the gas with ammonia. 
So far, the test is grabbing only about 1% of the greenhouse gas the plant coughs out. The method still consumes too much energy, says Sean Black, a manager at Alstom SA, the French company managing the test. "We're just in the beginning of this process," he says. 
The second step -- one not yet attempted here at the Wisconsin plant -- is to take the captured CO2 and dispose of it safely, perhaps by burying it. CO2 has been shot underground for decades in places like Texas, where it is injected into aging oil and gas fields to force the remaining fossil fuel up through wells. Some 30 million tons of CO2 are injected into oil and gas wells annually in the U.S., according to federal statistics. That is tiny -- less than 1% of the roughly six billion tons of CO2 the country annually exhales. 
Howard Herzog, a leading clean-coal specialist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a technological optimist and a political realist. He believes scientists can find ways to slash power plants' CO2 output just like they figured out how to slash those plants' output of pollutants that foul air and streams. But it will take a lot of money: MIT recommended in a recent study that the U.S. nearly quadruple its clean-coal spending, to $1 billion a year. And that is just for research. 
It also will take patience. An anticoal backlash is gathering steam in the U.S., and Mr. Herzog worries it will block all new coal-fired power plants in the country, which could boost electricity prices. A rational compromise, he believes, would be to allow new coal-fired plants to keep their CO2 emissions at the same level as natural-gas-fired plants through the use of cleaning technology. That would amount to an emissions cut of about 50% below the level of a conventional coal-fired plant, while raising the cost of generation by 50%, Mr. Herzog figures. Consumers probably wouldn't see rate boosts that high, he says, because generating costs are only one factor in determining retail electricity rates. 
Still, clean coal has proven too expensive before. Earlier this decade, the federal government launched a multibillion-dollar research program intended to build a carbon-free, coal-fired power plant. Last year, when the cost of that program nearly doubled to $1.8 billion, the government effectively shut it down. 
The Pleasant Prairie power plant is a monument to the fickleness of the nation's energy priorities -- and to the stubborness of coal. Designed in the wake of sweeping 1970s federal environmental laws, the power plant was the first built by Wisconsin Energy Corp. to burn coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin rather than from nearby Illinois or Appalachia. One reason is that Western coal is lower than the Eastern variety in sulfur, which forms a pollutant the laws capped. 
At the time, Wisconsin Energy intended to build new nuclear plants, too. But Wisconsin effectively banned new nuclear-plant construction in the state. Without an alternative, Wisconsin Energy has run the Pleasant Prairie plant to crank out more power than originally planned. As the federal government has further toughened clean-air standards, the company kept adding pollution-scrubbing equipment to keep the plant alive. 
The crackdown on CO2 is just the latest -- and biggest -- regulatory shift prodding more changes to the the plant. On a recent frigid morning, in a scene that brought to mind an old whiskey still, one of the shiny pipes for capturing CO2 was shaking and clanging, and steam was pouring out the top. Alstom's Mr. Black said the contraption looked so jury-rigged because engineers had to modify it to resolve problems that cropped up. 
That burst of steam could be the industry's last gasp. It also could be a fresh breath from an industry with plenty of life left.

Abstract 
[...] the regulators stipulated that insurers need not provide information that is "quantitative," that is "forward-looking," or that insurers "in good faith believe is commercially sensitive or proprietary." 

Full Text 
Insurance companies must start disclosing how climate change is likely to affect their businesses, state insurance regulators decided Tuesday. 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners voted to require insurers to submit annual "climate-risk" reports, an unusually aggressive stance on the environmental issue from industry regulators. 
The officials acted after concluding that climate change threatens insurers in two ways. It increases the risk of extreme weather events such as floods and wildfires, which would boost claims. And it is prompting governments to cap industrial carbon emissions that contribute to global warming -- a move threatens the profits of companies such as coal-fired utilities in which insurers commonly invest. 
Climate change "will have a huge impact on the insurance industry," particularly on property and casualty insurers, said Joel Ario, Pennsylvania's insurance commissioner and the head of the association's global-warming task force. 
Insurance commissioners also foresee climate change offering savvy insurers new ways to make money. One example: auto insurance with premiums based on the number of miles a person drives. Such policies would prod consumers to drive less, curbing their vehicles' carbon emissions. 
The commissioners' decision shows how the politics of climate change are shifting. In the past, a handful of insurers have expressed concern that the phenomenon threatens their portfolios. Most of those companies have been based in Europe, which already has imposed carbon-emission limits. But momentum is moving in the U.S. toward some sort of emission constraint, as the Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers have said they intend to impose such a cap. 
The insurance commissioners' decision came only after delicate negotiations over how tough to make the environmental requirements. Environmental activists wanted insurers to have to disclose specific information about how their businesses might be threatened by climate change, said Andrew Logan, director of the insurance program at Ceres, a Boston-based environmental group involved in the talks. The activists believe such disclosures will help them press their case in Washington for a tough federal cap on carbon emissions. 
Many insurers resisted. In the end, the regulators stipulated that insurers need not provide information that is "quantitative," that is "forward-looking," or that insurers "in good faith believe is commercially sensitive or proprietary." 
What information insurers choose to disclose will become public next year. Insurance companies with annual premiums totaling more than $500 million must submit their first annual climate-risk disclosure reports by May 1, 2010. 
Some carriers aren't happy with the regulators' decision. David Kodama, director of policy analysis for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, which represents more than 1,000 insurance companies, said his group is concerned that insurers that provide climate-risk information could face lawsuits alleging that their information isn't detailed enough.

Abstract 
Yet Congress, being Congress, is incapable of designing even a marginally efficient system -- and given environmental politics and state carbon realities, the losers will be concentrated in noncoastal regions that rely most on coal and manufacturing. [...] therein lies the value of emissions production data. 

Full Text 
We don't mind an intellectual fight, and in a nearby letter, two economists at Resources for the Future take aim at our Monday editorial on how the costs of cap and trade will be distributed across regions and income groups. Dallas Burtraw and Richard Sweeney call it "a bait-and-switch argument." Mr. Sweeney added on his blog that "The Wall Street Journal is an idiot."(see accompanying article -- WSJ Mar. 13, 2009) 
That's how the global-warming clerisy debates these days, but we'll try to take their argument seriously. They claim that by citing state-level CO2 production data, rather than CO2 consumption data, we exaggerated regional differences. This is distortion disguised as verisimilitude. 
It's true that discrepancies in per capita emissions -- 73 tons in West Virginia versus 12 tons in Rhode Island, for instance -- reflect the fact that carbon-heavy power plants and industries are based in some states and not others. It's also true that electricity crosses state lines, and that -- as cap and trade raises prices -- a consumer in California who buys a car built in Michigan, say, will bear some of its carbon costs. 
However, one reason we didn't mention per capita consumption figures is that, strictly speaking, they don't exist. The economic literature on the incidence of cap and trade extrapolates carbon consumption by region from the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey. But nearly every human activity has some carbon cost associated with it. Consider the emissions of "consuming" french fries at a fast food restaurant: 
There's CO2 in fertilizing and harvesting the potatoes; processing, freezing, then transporting them; and still more when they're cooked. Now multiply that by the entire economy. One danger of a carbon tax -- especially if it is poorly designed -- is it that its costs will ripple throughout complex energy chains in ways that economic modeling can't quantify. 
Still, in the spirit of comity, we'll mention the work of Messrs. Burtraw and Sweeney, who wrote a 2008 paper finding that cap and trade disproportionately hits the poorest households and that those effects are exacerbated in some regions over others. That was our argument too. 
Of course, ultimately the incidence of a carbon tax depends on how the revenues it takes from the public are redistributed back to the public. Yet Congress, being Congress, is incapable of designing even a marginally efficient system -- and given environmental politics and state carbon realities, the losers will be concentrated in noncoastal regions that rely most on coal and manufacturing. 
And therein lies the value of emissions production data. Not only does cap and trade tax at the point of production (even if some of those costs are ultimately borne by consumers elsewhere), but it also shifts economic activity away from those industries. The states that produce the most emissions are going to see the strongest ancillary declines in income and increases in unemployment. The top carbon states -- in absolute, not per capita, emissions -- include Ohio (No. 3), Pennsylvania (No. 4), Indiana (No. 7) and Michigan (No. 9). 
What really drives cap-and-trade idolaters like Messrs. Burtraw and Sweeney to schoolboy taunts is their fear that the American people might figure this out. Then their dreams of having government command a huge new chunk of the economy might collapse.

Abstract 
Most of the money raised would go toward a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families, subject to income limits. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- Democratic congressional leaders are encountering opposition from key Senate Democrats to the president's plan to put a price on carbon this year, and are considering bypassing normal Senate procedures to push through legislation. 
President Barack Obama's 2010 budget plan calls for using a carbon cap-and-trade system to raise as much as $646 billion in new revenue for the government between 2012 and 2020. 
The system would set limits on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases industries could emit, and sell rights to emit those gases that could be traded among companies. Most of the money raised would go toward a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families, subject to income limits. The rest would go to subsidize clean technology research, under the president's proposal. 
Under normal rules, backers of the cap-and-trade bill would need 60 Senate votes to cut off debate and move to final action. As of now, it's not clear Democratic leaders have those votes. 
In a harbinger of the trouble Democrats face over environmental legislation, the House on Wednesday voted down a proposal to set aside more than two million acres in nine states as protected wilderness. A majority of House members supported the bill, but it fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. 
On the much broader climate issue, several Democratic senators from Rust Belt and coal-producing states have warned that they may not support legislation that lacks sufficient protections for their home-state manufacturing and mining interests. 
On Wednesday, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad (D., N.D.), said it is "unlikely" climate legislation will pass the Senate "if it doesn't have money set aside for industries that will be especially hard hit." 
The sparring over climate change underscores the choices facing Democratic leaders, who could try to push through a cap-and-trade bill using "reconciliation" rules that shield certain budget measures from filibusters. In an interview, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag said the administration is considering trying to pass climate legislation using such rules, which require 51 votes rather than a filibuster-proof 60. 
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Jim Manley, said that Mr. Reid is weeks away from making a decision about how to proceed on cap-and-trade legislation. 
In 2001, Republicans used the budget reconciliation process to push through tax cuts called for by then-President George W. Bush, and many Democrats accused Mr. Bush of bypassing the democratic process. 
The debate over climate is not taking place in a vacuum. The decision on climate change will be balanced against other Democratic priorities, including whether the partisan fighting likely to be spurred by the move would poison cooperation on other initiatives. In the run-up to action on the 2010 budget, Democrats are also debating whether to seek filibuster-proof protections for Mr. Obama's health-care plan, as well as a proposal to change the way the government finances student loans. 
Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat from coal-state Montana and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said "it's not a good idea" to use reconciliation to pass cap-and-trade, and the partisan nature of such a strategy would cause the administration trouble. "It's possible 51 votes could be found, but at what cost?" he said. 
Republicans were more blunt. "It's a horrible idea, [and] would be seen as a vast power grab and would be wildly unpopular," said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas).

Abstract 
Power utilities that burn lots of coal are pressing for a revamp of proposed federal climate-change policy to offer greater financial leeway and extra time to overhaul their operations. 

Full Text 
Power utilities that burn lots of coal are pressing for a revamp of proposed federal climate-change policy to offer greater financial leeway and extra time to overhaul their operations. 
President Barack Obama has pledged to establish climate-change legislation including a cap-and-trade system that would allow polluters to buy and sell emission credits, and a government auction of allowances that polluters would have to buy if they couldn't cut their emissions by the required amount. 
Executives at American Electric Power Inc., Duke Energy Corp. and other companies say any U.S. regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions should include a partial giveaway of emissions allowances and an enforcement grace period to give the companies more time to work on new technology. Coal-fired power plants account for 33% of U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Development of the technology to capture CO2 from power-plant stacks and bury it underground is at an early stage. 
"Clean coal is not here today because we don't have the technology to do it," AEP Chief Executive Michael Morris said at The Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference last week. "Our hope is that by 2012 we'll scale it up. But coal is not going to go away. If I shut things down, people are going to sit in the dark and freeze." 
As part of the $3.55 trillion budget plan President Obama gave to Congress last week, the administration proposed cutting greenhouse-gas emissions from all major sources to 14% below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. The proposal estimates that the federal government would receive $646 billion from auctioning off credits from 2012 through 2019. 
The Obama administration has acknowledged that the plan would boost energy costs for some lower- and middle-income consumers, and has said the government would use some of the money raised from the auctions to offset the higher costs. 
Such relief to customers isn't enough, Duke Energy CEO James Rogers said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. Mr. Rogers said power prices for all Duke customers would rise if the utility had to purchase allowances for all its carbon emissions allowances, with rates seen jumping as much as 40% in Indiana, he said. 
"At end of the day you'll have a blend of an allocation and auction system," Mr. Rogers said. Free allowances, or allocations, "need to go to the local distribution company and we need to make that transition equitable," Mr. Rogers said. 
Utilities should also be allowed a transition period to switch to cleaner technologies, similar to the way in which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowed for a grace period in the 1990s when it introduced requirements for generators to cut sulfur dioxide emissions, Mr. Rogers said. 
"We didn't build (power plant) scrubbers right away because it hadn't evolved," Mr. Rogers said. "We waited for the second or third generation of technology because (sulfur dioxide) allowance prices were low. Now, we've reduced our emissions 70% and we've been able to minimize and smooth out the impact to our customers over time." 
Critics, including former Vice President Al Gore, argue that the outlook for carbon capture and storage and other clean-coal technologies are dubious and that carbon legislation should be drafted under the assumption that they will not be available. 
The threat from climate change involves massive costs and these need to be factored into the use of coal, Mr. Gore said at the conference. "We have to fix the defects in the way the market now ignores carbon dioxide; we have to put a price on carbon," he said. 
Duke's Mr. Rogers said he agrees with the need to put a price on carbon so that utilities can plan their future costs.

Utilities Industry Loses Its Juice 
Over Carbon Plan, Dividend Cuts 
Sector is Second-Worst S&P Performer, Behind Financials 
One of the market's traditionally defensive sectors has recently been anything but. 
In the past several weeks, as the market has hit 12-year lows, each of the 10 industries in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost ground. In March, after financials, the worst performer has been the utilities sector, down 9%. 
Strategists point to concerns about the Obama administration's efforts to limit carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade program that would tax offenders, including many utility companies, along with concerns about higher financing costs and reduced demand. 
Recent dividend cuts, along with expectations that favorable tax treatment for dividends will lapse in 2010, also are weighing on the sector. Ameren Corp. and Great Plains Energy Inc. reduced their quarterly payouts in February by 39% and 50%, respectively, calling into question the view that utilities were a safe source of dividends. 
Utilities were hardly standouts in 2008; the sector fell nearly 32%, but that was third best among the 10 industry sectors and short of the S&P's 39% decline. The stocks weren't particularly weak in the early part of the year, but as expectations for climate-control legislation have risen, so too has investor concern, because of the potential cost for utility companies. 
In commentary last week, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Hugh Wynne noted that climate-control legislation is high on the list of priorities of Democrats in the House and Senate. He said a bill that was moving through Congress last year may be resuscitated, one that he said was "guided in large part by the need to establish support for climate change legislation among coal state Democrats and affected industries." 
These worries have caused shares to decline, making their valuations more attractive, said Dan Eggers, analyst at Credit Suisse Group, who upgraded shares of utilities Duke Energy Corp. and Consolidated Edison Inc. on Tuesday. 
Mr. Eggers said utilities trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, lower than the sector's long-term average. He added that dividend yields are at 19-year highs -- more than yields on bonds issued by utility companies. 
As for those worried about the expiration of the 2003 tax cuts that lowered the rate on dividends, Mr. Eggers is less concerned. 
He said the lower taxes boosted price-to-earning multiples in the sector, but amid the selloff "that lift has been stripped out of the stocks at this point."

Abstract 
Why are you doing it? ERIC SCHMIDT: Because energy matters. [...] the way you solve the environment problem is you solve the energy problem. 

Full Text 
Many think of Google Inc. as a search company. But it's also an investor in renewable energy, and it has proposed an ambitious plan to put clean energy at the heart of the U.S. 
energy mix. 
The plan promotes energy efficiency, a massive renewable-energy push to replace coal, and an accelerated rollout of plug-in cars. 
Google's chairman and CEO, Eric Schmidt, discussed the company's energy plan with The Wall Street Journal's Alan Murray. Here are edited excerpts of their discussion. 

ALAN MURRAY: The nation may not have a national energy plan, but Google does. Why are you doing it? 
ERIC SCHMIDT: Because energy matters. And the way you solve the environment problem is you solve the energy problem. From a Google perspective it's the right thing to do 
for the world. It's also good for our business because we're in the information business. And a lot of the energy solutions involve a lot of information. 

MR. MURRAY: But that would have to be a pretty small part of your overall business, energy information. 
MR. SCHMIDT: Well, but we're happy to make money everywhere. 
It seems to me that we're in a situation where you've got to get out and take a stand. So we talked about it, and [Google founders] Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] talked about 

it a lot, and Larry's had an interest in this for a very long time. We need to take a stand. We'll put up a proposal, and you can shoot at us, but at least we put up a proposal and 

at least you can judge us based on what we said. 
MR. MURRAY: One of the early speeches you gave on this was in September. I pulled something up off the Web where people were commenting on it. A shareholder says, "I 
don't want Eric Schmidt out there talking about green-energy investments. I understand they consume a lot of energy but that doesn't address the top line, it has a marginal 
effect on earnings. Don't do it." What do you say to shareholders who say this isn't the way you should be spending your time? 

MR. SCHMIDT: The shareholder value in a company is created at the end of everything you do. You create shareholder value by serving your customers, building a great business, and if you do a great job your stock will go up. So they're not first in the discussion point. What's really first at Google is about changing the world, in a positive way. Can we make a difference? In our case, we're huge energy users, so a relatively straightforward solution to our energy costs goes right to the bottom line. 
MR. MURRAY: Let's talk about the specifics of the plan. You set a target date of 2030 to get utilities totally off carbon fuels. 
MR. SCHMIDT: That's correct. It's easier if I make the argument this way. You've got to solve a whole bunch of problems. You've got to solve the energy-generation problem, 

and you've got to solve the transportation problem. So when you add it all up, if you make, in our view, the right assumptions and you invest in the right ways, you end up 
saving money. That's the thing that was most surprising to me. 
So the rough numbers are, we need about $3.5 trillion of investment over 22 years, as opposed to over three months, and we generate on a cost basis a savings of $4.4 trillion. 

If you invest in the right way, you can make money by doing this. And the way you do it is you've got to figure out a way to install the renewable energy and the distribution network to get it to consumers, and you've got to address the energy-efficiency issues with respect to cars. 
MR. MURRAY: Let's start with the renewable energy, the utility piece of it. Your 2030 plan takes renewables to like a third of our energy sources, up from 1% or 2% now. 
MR. SCHMIDT: What we did is we kept the current sources of power roughly constant, because you figure they're not going to be turned off. In particular we kept nuclear at its 
current absolute number. 

MR. MURRAY: You don't want more nuclear in your plan? 
MR. SCHMIDT: Our plan does not require more nuclear, and it also does not require it to be turned off, which is important. 
[One of] the assumptions we made is that you would enact essentially a renewable portfolio standard and constant energy efficiency which, on a per capita basis, has been 

achieved in California since 1973. If you look at per capita use of energy in the U.S., it has gone up over 30 years, largely due to regulatory issues, in our view. MR. MURRAY: I don't want to leave utilities yet because it's really the notion that we can, between now and 2030, go from well under 1% wind power to a huge percentage, 10%, in your plan. And solar from very small percentages. 
MR. SCHMIDT: Wind is, on a kilowatt-per-hour basis, roughly similar to the cost of coal after the subsidies it gets today, and without the subsidies it's a couple cents higher per 

kilowatt. So that's pretty good. It's the one that's closest now to being a free substitute for coal, which is the most common power source that we all have. 
The issue, of course, is the wind doesn't blow in the places where the people are. So in order to make these systems really work, you also have to have the grid technology. And 
the problem with the grid is it takes two years to get the line built and eight years to get the permits. I'm not making that up, by the way. So you fundamentally have to 
establish either federal rights of way for these things or other incentives that cause the utilities to actually be able to build these power plants. 

MR. MURRAY: So the federal government has to say we can site these transmission lines where we need to. 
MR. SCHMIDT: That has been discussed. The Obama administration has already indicated very strong support for a federal renewable portfolio standard. An alternative if that 

does not get through -- and I suspect it will get through -- is that you can imagine incentives at the state level where, if two states have RPS's, they can basically build these lines quicker with federal help. The arguments that we make do not work unless you solve the problem that the wind blows in the middle part of the country from north to south, and by the way there's a 
tremendous amount of wind, and the sun shines primarily in the deserts and heats up the ground for enhanced geothermal. 
MR. MURRAY: That's critical, you have to do that. 
MR. SCHMIDT: Absolutely critical. If you look at the rate of improvement of solar photovoltaic and solar thermal, they are behind wind but they're going to get there. It's 

remarkable how quickly they're moving. 

MR. MURRAY: And do you see a distributed plan? Are you talking about me putting solar panels on my house or are you talking about centralized solar power-generated 
facilities? 
MR. SCHMIDT: All solutions ultimately are distributed. One of the errors that we have is that we have a patchwork of economics and incentives that distort what is an obviously 

correct model, which is distributed power. And you want people to be able to generate and send power back into the grid. In fact, it's becoming possible to have a real business 
of generating power and sending it to the utilities. 
MR. MURRAY: And why not clean coal? Why not carbon capture, why not take advantage of the technologies that can make coal plants cleaner? 
MR. SCHMIDT: First of all, there's a lot of great progress in carbon capture and sequestration. I don't use the term clean coal because I think it's misused. 

MR. MURRAY: Because you don't think coal is clean? 
MR. SCHMIDT: If we're going to talk about coal, I'd like to talk about it in the context of its CO2 load as opposed to the other particulates that clean coal typically represents. So 
the fundamental problem is that coal, which is the most prevalent source of energy in the U.S. and China, generates too much CO2. It really does contribute to global warming. 

Now, one answer to that is that you have a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. I am skeptical as to whether those are going to happen simply because they have the wrong 

words in them -- taxes and prices and so forth. 
There are many, many people who believe that they're the right answer, but I think politically we have to act as though those will occur but not anytime soon. We assume 
carbon capture and sequestration will work, but we assume that it will take a fairly long time for those systems to be prevalent enough. 

I should say that we're having a U.S.-based conversation here, but we can solve all the problems in the U.S. and get them right and we can still die as a society, basically 

because of the issues in China and India. 
And so we have to solve the efficient-car problem in the U.S., but it's even more important to establish it at lower price points in developing countries, which is where most of 
the cars are going to get sold. Now, maybe you start in the U.S. and you learn from that and you scale from there. These need to be global solutions. 

MR. MURRAY: I have seen you say in other venues that you stepped into this gap because you felt there was an enormous lack of leadership in the U.S. on energy issues. Do 

you still feel that? 
MR. SCHMIDT: Obviously, the administration makes a huge difference, and President Obama, then candidate Obama, had indicated a very strong support for renewable energy. 
And I think with politicians you want to judge them based on what they do, not what they say. The stimulus bill that was passed had $50 billion of renewable investment. 

MR. MURRAY: Is it in the right places as far as you're concerned? 
MR. SCHMIDT: It's good enough. Given that the government is two months old, they did a good job.

Abstract 
What seems likeliest is a cap-and-trade system in which the government would distribute a set number of permits for companies to emit those gases, and then companies would buy and sell those permits among themselves, creating an economic incentive to find emission cuts at the lowest possible cost. 

Full Text 
All bets are off in the business of the environment. 
A year ago, energy prices were surging, and the new-energy industry was growing at a feverish pace. Wind-turbine and solar-panel makers were cranking out their wares full-throttle. Fuel-efficient cars were flying off dealer lots. 
Today, amid a recession, Americans aren't buying much of anything at all. Capital markets have frozen and energy prices have plummeted, and one of the hardest-hit victims has been the clean-energy industry that not long ago seemed on top of a new world. 
ECO:nomics, The Wall Street Journal's second annual conference on the business of the environment, revealed last week the conundrum in which companies seeking to profit from a shift to cleaner forms of energy now find themselves. These companies are betting that over the long term, an improving economy and deepening concerns about global-warming emissions will lead to new technologies that will crank out energy with less impact on the climate. But what do they do in the meantime? How can they maintain their momentum as they wait for the economy to bounce back? 
Within that cauldron of uncertainty, many questions are bubbling. 
Some questions are about technologies. Does the future of power production in the U.S. continue to rest on cleaning up coal? Or in ramping up renewable energy? Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google Inc., predicted renewable energy could produce about 30% of U.S. electricity by 2030. Michael Morris, CEO of American Electric Power Co., said he thinks that's too optimistic. Behind that debate are questions about the viability not only of "clean coal," but also of nuclear energy, which emits essentially no carbon dioxide but has long been politically unpopular. 
And what will the automobile of the future run on? Google has talked up the possibility of plug-in hybrid electric cars. Vinod Khosla, managing partner of Khosla Ventures, a prominent energy investor, said he's particularly excited about the potential for biofuels. Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens envisions a future in which vehicles, starting with trucks, run on natural gas. 
Other questions are about politics -- notably, how the Obama administration and Congress will choose to impose a cost on greenhouse-gas emissions. What seems likeliest is a cap-and-trade system in which the government would distribute a set number of permits for companies to emit those gases, and then companies would buy and sell those permits among themselves, creating an economic incentive to find emission cuts at the lowest possible cost. 
Former Vice President Al Gore said some sort of price on carbon is necessary to propel technological development forward. Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, said Europe's experience reveals the deep flaws in a cap-and-trade system. 
For now, much of the money pouring into the environmental market has dried up. But there's probably no better sign that the market is likely to bounce back than that those who will be the most affected by it are arguing mightily over its details.

Getting Going: Investors Won't Like Obama's Budget

Abstract 
[...] the horrid economy and the flailing financial system are playing a key role in driving down share prices, but the budget is providing one more reason for investors to wince. In the energy sector, the administration proposes a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions associated with climate change. 

Full Text 
President Obama's ambitious budget proposals may be what the current crisis needs, but for investors they're no St. Patrick's Day present. 
After spending more than a week digesting the massive spending proposals, the market is in a funk and any fleeting optimism has mostly evaporated. Certainly the horrid economy and the flailing financial system are playing a key role in driving down share prices, but the budget is providing one more reason for investors to wince. 
In broad terms, the president's plan will mean a great deal more government spending and involvement in the economy, a marked change from the general budget approach since 1980. This raises questions about "crowding out" in the private sector, where the government takes on a bigger role, reducing opportunity for business. 
The budget also calls for higher taxes on wealthier Americans, though not straight away. These higher taxes will come in the form of higher marginal tax rates and higher capital-gains taxes, but they currently aren't scheduled to come into effect until the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. This focus on the wealthy, most of whom are investors in the stock market, is another reason that the markets have taken on a glummer tone. 
But the budget, while met with general opprobrium on Wall Street, does have some potential positives for investors. Greater government spending -- and there promises to be quite a lot of it -- could crowd out some private business, but it should also translate into economic growth as new jobs are created. 
Just how strong that government-led growth will be is an open question, however, and the Federal Reserve has recently forecast that growth will be slower than at any time since 1950 for the next several years. 
While there may be frustration at the scale and scope of the budget, investors should focus on two things in particular: where the government will spend money and how the tax system will change. The first issue matters because government attention can, as noted above, alter market dynamics in ways that will either help or hurt various sectors. The second issue matters because taxes, especially those focused on investment, have an impact on returns. 
The Obama administration's plans focus on three sectors in particular: the financial system, health care and energy. 
In terms of the financial system, the plans look like more of the same. The new budget seeks an additional $750 billion in financial rescue money to go along with the $700 billion approved last fall. Given the recent performance of financial shares, there's little confidence that the new plans will help investors anytime soon. 
The health-care plans are nearly as opaque, but expectations are for an increase in government involvement in that sector as the administration seeks to expand coverage to all Americans. Such plans would likely shrink the market for private health insurers and could undercut incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs. The Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. health-care stock index is down 18% this year. 
In the energy sector, the administration proposes a cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions associated with climate change. This program would act as a new tax, generating an estimated $78.7 billion in revenue in 2012 and $646 billion in revenue in 2019. Generally, investors despise new taxes since they usually curtail growth. 
The cap-and-trade program would create higher costs for energy-intensive industries, such as aluminum producers. Alcoa shares, already depressed by the moribund economy, have fallen more than 50% since year-end. It would also place pressure on coal companies or companies that burn coal. 
On the plus side, alternative energies such as solar and wind would benefit from new government support and investments. Some of these companies, like First Solar, have perked up since the new budget was announced. The challenge for these technologies is that they are not particularly competitive when oil prices are low, which is the case today. 
Tax policy will be important for investors to watch as the budget debate unfolds. As lawmakers grapple with the Christmas tree of new and larger programs, the budget is more likely to grow than shrink. Already, the new budget is $4 trillion, a whopping $1 trillion increase over the previous budget. That number, remarkably, could grow as more ornaments are festooned upon the tree. 
The market may already reflect some of that pessimism. Persistently high budget deficits could raise questions about the dollar or prompt a return to a more inflationary environment, neither of which would thrill investors. 
Economists at the Fed and elsewhere do not believe inflation will be a problem for the foreseeable future, citing anemic labor activity and non-existent upward pressure on wages. But it's difficult to find equally sanguine views about the soaring budget deficits ahead.

The Climate Change Lobby Has Regrets

Abstract 
President Obama's auction bonanza would earn the feds $650 billion in 10 years, according to the administration's budget estimate -- and that's a low, low, low estimate. [...] Mr. Rogers's lament. 

Full Text 
Jim Rogers is not happy with the Obama administration. Ever since the White House unveiled its costly climate program, the CEO of Duke Energy has been arguing the proposals amount to nothing more than a tax. Indeed. 
Mr. Rogers belongs to the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, about 30 companies that decided they were going to dance with the U.S government to the tune of global warming legislation. The group demanded a "cap-and-trade" system, figuring they'd craft the rules so as to obtain regulatory certainty, with little upfront cost. At the time, Mr. Rogers explained: "If you don't have a seat at the table, you'll wind up on the menu." 
Duke sat, yet it and its compatriots are still shaping up to be Washington's breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Obama plan will cost plenty, upfront, which will be borne by Mr. Rogers's customers. The Duke CEO tells me that he still sees opportunity to change the proposal: "This is not my first rodeo, in terms of working with the legislative process." There nonetheless may be a lesson here for companies that invite the U.S. government to saddle them with huge, expensive regulations. 
"People are learning," says William Kovacs, vice president of environment, technology and regulatory affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which has been cautious about embracing a climate plan). "The Obama budget did more to help us consolidate and coalesce the business community than anything we could have done. It's opened eyes to the fact that this is about a social welfare transfer system, not about climate." 
Truth is, any cap-and-trade system is a tax, even if Mr. Obama's plan has only started to force business proponents to admit it. The government sets a cap on how much greenhouse gas can be emitted annually. Companies buy and sell permits that allow them to emit. Customers bear the price of those permits. 
But the political question was always how that first batch of permits would end up with companies. Corporate support rested on the belief they'd be "allocated," for free. This would allow them to delay the day when they'd have to pass costs on to consumers, and ignore, for now, the "tax" question. 
It didn't take long for the pols to figure out they could auction off permits and spend the loot. President Obama's auction bonanza would earn the feds $650 billion in 10 years, according to the administration's budget estimate -- and that's a low, low, low estimate. 
Thus Mr. Rogers's lament. No one can now pretend that this isn't going to cost, and Duke is going to be tagged as tax collector via higher electricity bills. If the customer outrage won't be enough, some utilities will also be forced into fights with state regulators, who have to approve the rate-hike requests. 
Congress isn't sympathetic. Most Democrats want the money to spend, while many Republicans have written off companies asking for government freebies. "What you saw when [the Climate Action Partnership] was draping itself in the name of saving mankind, what they were really doing was trying to create the largest earmark in modern history," says Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker of the "allocation" system. 
Mr. Corker has been having fun exposing the self-dealing in recent climate bills. Companies aside, he blew an early whistle on Congress's ambitions to use an auction system to enrich itself. During last year's debate on Sen. Barbara Boxer's (D., Calif.) climate bill, he offered an amendment to require rebates of all auction funds to American families. It helped kill the bill, as did a growing awareness among Midwest and Southern Democrats that the legislation would disproportionately hammer their industries and constituents. 
Mr. Obama is promising to return auction money to Americans, via a tax cut he proposed on the campaign trail. Mr. Corker calls this a "sleight of hand," since people were counting on a tax cut in any event. Nobody told them they'd have to fund it with higher energy costs. It's also a wealth transfer -- electricity users in coal-heavy Ohio, for instance, will be funding tax cuts for green Californians. Not that congressional spenders have any intention of using this money for tax cuts in the first place. 
All this foreshadows the political battles to come. With the business community moving more uniformly against the bill, the administration will be looking to cut a deal. One way to buy support is to offer a certain percentage of the permits for free. Next comes the fight over how much money the government gets to keep versus how much goes to states or individuals. Expect a lot of political courting of Midwest and Southern members, on whom the fate of the Obama plan hinges. 
Business leaders might do better to use this as an opportunity to kill the beast. They might get some credit for protecting their customers from what they are now, finally, admitting is a giant tax -- in the middle of a recession.

The Obama Budget: Carbon Trading to Raise Consumer Energy Prices

Abstract 
To help achieve that goal, Mr. Obama wants to spend some of the money raised through the auction of emissions permits for research and development of low-carbon energy technologies, such as windmills, electric cars or more efficient power grids and buildings. 

Full Text 
The cost of energy for consumers would be driven higher in President Barack Obama's proposed budget by a carbon cap-and-trade system that is projected to raise about $80 billion a year starting in 2012. 
The budget assumes the U.S. adopts the cap-and-trade system that would set limits on the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that industries can emit, and allow companies to buy and sell rights to emit those gases. The budget assumes a starting price of $20 per ton for carbon emissions, an amount that Mr. Obama's aides says is conservative and would likely rise. 
The budget projects raising $645 billion from the auction of emissions credits between 2012, when the system kicks in, and 2019. Mr. Obama would use some of that money to pay for about $120 billion of spending on various low-carbon technologies over that time. The rest of the money -- about $525 billion -- would be retuned "to the people, especially vulnerable families, communities and businesses to help the transition to a clean energy economy," according to Mr. Obama's proposal. 
The cap-and-trade system is a key part of Mr. Obama's broader strategy to reduce U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide by roughly 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. To help achieve that goal, Mr. Obama wants to spend some of the money raised through the auction of emissions permits for research and development of low-carbon energy technologies, such as windmills, electric cars or more efficient power grids and buildings. 
But some question the government's ability to spend all that money wisely. It is also unclear whether lawmakers will be able to resist diverting money to causes that have little to do with fighting climate change, such as deficit reduction. 
"Let's just be honest and call it a carbon tax that will increase taxes on all Americans who drive a car, who have a job, who turn on a light switch, pure and simple," said the Republican leader in the House, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio. 
A fundamental question is how the government will distribute the billions of dollars in revenue generated through a emissions trading system. Lawmakers from states dependent on coal and heavy manufacturing are expected to demand that more money go toward their constituents, since they will experience higher costs associated with the transition to low-carbon energy sources. 
Mr. Obama's aides say his plan would provide a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for working families. The credits would phase out between $150,000 and $200,000 for a married couple, and between $75,000 and $100,000 for an individual. 
"This is going to change the distribution of wealth potentially for a century," said Dallas Burtraw, an economist at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. 
Mr. Obama's budget also calls for new fees and taxes on oil companies that drill on federal lands, and for closing various tax credits that the industry currently qualifies for -- a step the administration says would raise about $30 billion over a decade. Beginning in 2011, Mr. Obama would assess a new excise tax on oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico to close what Mr. Obama's aides say are loopholes that have give companies "excessive royalty relief." 
Oil-industry officials said Mr. Obama's proposals would encourage the industry to shift production -- and jobs -- abroad. "With America in the midst of an economic recession, now is not the time to impose new taxes on the nation's oil and natural gas industry," Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a written statement.

Abstract 
The Administration in fact projects that these "climate revenues" will become the sixth largest source of federal receipts by 2019, outpaced only by individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare and (barely) excise taxes. 

Full Text 
That didn't take long. The same week that President Obama promised (again) that "95% of working families" would not see their taxes rise by "a single dime," his own budget reveals that taxes will rise for 100% of everyone for the sake of global warming. Ahem. 
You don't even have to burrow into yesterday's budget fine print to discover the "climate revenues" section, where the White House discloses that it expects $78.7 billion in new tax revenue in 2012 from its cap-and-trade program. The pot of cash grows to $237 billion through 2014, and at least $646 billion through 2019. If this isn't tax revenue, what is it? Manna from heaven? The offset from Al Gore's carbon footprint? 
If it brings in revenue that the government then spends, it's a tax, and politicians should start referring to it as such. The Administration in fact projects that these "climate revenues" will become the sixth largest source of federal receipts by 2019, outpaced only by individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare and (barely) excise taxes. We're supposed to be living in a new era of fiscal honesty, so let's start with cap and trade. 
Of course it's easy to see why Democrats don't want the public to think of cap and trade as a tax. Tax increases aren't popular, as Mr. Gore learned when he and Bill Clinton tried to impose a BTU tax in 1993. The complex cap-and-trade tax would ripple throughout the energy chain and ultimately the entire economy. All consumers, not just "the rich," would pay more for goods and services that use carbon energy -- though some would pay more than others. A majority of those "95% of working families" probably lives in the middle of the country that relies far more on manufacturing and coal-fired power than do the better-off coastal regions. 
Mr. Obama's Energy Secretary Steven Chu was refreshingly candid on this point with the New York Times earlier this month. Given that higher prices are supposed to motivate the changes necessary to reduce carbon energy use, Mr. Chu said he was worried that climate taxes may drive jobs to countries where costs are cheaper. "The concern about cap and trade in today's economic climate," he said, "is that a lot of money might flow to developing countries in a way that might not be completely politically sellable." You are correct, sir. 
Meanwhile, the political class loves a cap-and-trade tax because it gives them new economic and political power. Congress would create a new property right to expend CO2, setting a price per ton on carbon output, and then Congress would also get to determine the distribution of allowances. The Administration wants all of them to be auctioned off, which is what creates the giant revenue windfall. The politicians would then decide how to spend all of that new "climate revenue." 
Mr. Obama's budget proposes to spend this windfall on two items: $15 billion a year in more subsidies for alternative fuels, and $65 billion or so a year to finance tax subsidies for workers, many of whom don't pay income taxes. In other words, once this cap-and-trade tax is on the books, the revenue stream will create political constituencies that depend on it. 
No new pot of gold goes uncontested, however, so you can assume that Mr. Obama's priorities will not go unchallenged. Already on Capitol Hill, Charlie Rangel's tax committee and Henry Waxman's energy clan are feuding about who gets to divvy up the spoils. Not to mention who gets the political control that will become a source of tens of millions in new campaign contributions from thousands of affected businesses. 
By the way, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that cap-and-trade taxes would actually throw off as much as $300 billion every year -- not merely $78.7 billion -- and in a footnote the Obama budget implicitly acknowledges that its $645.7 billion estimate is a lowball: "All additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public." No doubt.

Abstract 
According to farm lobbyists, Tom Vilsack, the newly minted agriculture secretary, has been telling farm trade groups in recent weeks that fixed direct payments have outlived their usefulness. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Industries from health care to agribusiness to mining that stand to lose under President Barack Obama's policy agenda are ramping up lobbying campaigns to derail or modify his plans. 
The day after Mr. Obama formally laid out his policy goals in his first address to Congress, the former chief executive of HCA Inc. unveiled a $20 million campaign to pressure Democrats to enact health-care legislation based on free-market principles. 
"What you see is when the government gets involved, you run out of money and health care gets rationed," former CEO Richard Scott said Wednesday, after announcing the creation of Conservatives for Patients Rights. 
Mr. Obama's ambitious agenda -- ranging from expanding health-care coverage to cutting farm subsidies to cutting wasteful defense projects -- touches almost every part of the 
U.S. economy. It threatens to disrupt the business models of a broad swath of America's biggest companies. 
Opinion polls indicate that Mr. Obama's broad goals enjoy popular support. But crucial details of the president's agenda will be decided in coming months by close-in legislative fighting, where big industries and the members of Congress that support them have plenty of clout. At the same time, threatened interests are gearing up to shape the coming debates with multimillion-dollar public-relations and lobbying campaigns. 
The agriculture lobby quickly recoiled Wednesday against President Obama's vow to "end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them," though industry leaders and farm-state legislators weren't sure which government payments they'll have to defend. 
"We were surprised President Obama included farm payments in his speech," said Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. "But it is Congress where the rubber meets the road." 
A plunge in commodity grain prices since last summer is shrinking profits across the farm sector, making it even more politically dicey for farm-state legislators to go along with any cuts in federal aid. Earlier this month, the U.S. Agriculture Department predicted that U.S. net farm income, a rough measure of profitability, will drop 20% this year to $71.2 billion from last year's record-high $89.3 billion. 
The line in the president's speech about agribusiness seemed to merge two distinct ideas for overhauling subsidies. While the president didn't define "large agribusinesses," he favored as a presidential candidate limiting the amount of federal subsidies an individual grower can receive to $250,000, an idea that is included on the rural agenda of the White House Web site. The Senate voted down such a proposal as recently as December 2007. 
The other idea floating around Washington is to scrap a type of subsidy check called the "fixed direct payment," which since 1996 has put about $68 billion into the pockets of growers. According to farm lobbyists, Tom Vilsack, the newly minted agriculture secretary, has been telling farm trade groups in recent weeks that fixed direct payments have outlived their usefulness. 
Meanwhile, an alliance of electric utilities, coal and mining companies said it will spend as much as $40 million to make sure Congress approves a global-warming plan with funding for technology to reduce emissions that includes carbon capture and storage at coal-fired plants. In his speech, Mr. Obama called for a $15 billion-a-year investment in clean-energy sources, including clean coal. 
Joe Lucas, a senior vice president of communications for the industry coalition, says the industry is "winning the public-policy debate," but will continue funding advertisements in order to "continue to be out there in the public dialogue." 
Even before Mr. Obama's speech, the defense industry had stepped up its advertising and lobbying efforts this week in response to the president's vow to crack down on defense-project cost overruns, and to separate proposals in Congress to cut off certain expensive weapons programs. Mr. Obama's criticism, industry officials fear, is a foreshadowing of deep cuts to come. 
The Aerospace Industries Association of America has spent $2 million so far on an ad campaign urging that defense spending shouldn't be slashed to offset shortfalls in other areas. 
Boeing Co. announced Wednesday new players in its Washington team, including a new top lobbyist, David H. Morrison, who hails from powerhouse firm Podesta Group. 
Defense companies have a wind at their back: the jobs they create, and the congressional support that goes with them. That could provide a boost to Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F­22 Raptor, the Air Force's most advanced fighter, whose production line will have to begin shutting down if more jets aren't ordered soon. 
Lockheed is mobilizing grass-roots Web efforts and traditional lobbying to keep the plane going, and the Air Force will ask Defense Secretary Robert Gates for more planes. But it's still not clear whether he will allocate money for more of the $143 million jets, which have been faulted for their high cost and for their origin as a Cold War-era system.

A Compromise Energy Policy Is Within Reach

Abstract 
[...] transitional incentives are needed to make low-carbon energy competitive with other energy sources, and to kick-start technologies for large-scale carbon abatement, such as carbon capture and storage. 

Full Text 
Every U.S. president since Richard Nixon has expressed concern about America's growing dependence on imported oil. But effective action has proved elusive: Oil imports have more than doubled in the past 35 years -- from 30% at the time of the first oil shock in 1973 to around 65% today. 
Yet the collapse in world energy demand and the fall of energy prices present a rare, once-in-a-generation opportunity. Congress and the Obama administration can work with energy producers to craft an energy policy that creates jobs, expands and diversifies the nation's energy supply, generates government revenue, and protects the environment. 
Reaching those goals begins with rejecting the false choice between "drill, baby, drill" and a near-exclusive focus on alternative energies and conservation. An "all-of-the-above" approach holds far more promise. 
President Barack Obama seems to recognize this. In his address to Congress this week, he spoke forthrightly about the need to tackle climate change -- while acknowledging the role of hydrocarbons in the overall energy mix, and emphasizing the need for energy security and efficiency. At BP we welcome his commitment to "invest $15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power, advanced biofuels, clean coal and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America." 
BP has already demonstrated its commitment to a diverse energy portfolio. We're the largest producer of oil and gas in the U.S. We're also investing more than $8 billion over 10 years to develop solar, wind, hydrogen power and biofuels. We support energy conservation and efficiency, as well as addressing climate change via a cap-and-trade system to harness the power of the market to reduce CO2 emissions. 
But if the country is to gain full value from the technology, knowledge and expertise possessed by BP and its major competitors, I'd like to offer policy makers a few suggestions. 
First, energy providers and governments must have confidence in one another. An adversarial stance does nothing to increase the supply of energy. Regulatory policies need to be sensible, stable and right the first time. 
Second, energy security can only be built on a solid foundation of free markets and free trade. Two-thirds of the world's oil is traded across international borders. This huge and agile market makes it possible to respond quickly to supply disruptions, such as hurricanes or political unrest. Tariffs, heavy taxes, or restrictions on the free movement of petroleum products interfere with that process. 
Third, transitional incentives are needed to make low-carbon energy competitive with other energy sources, and to kick-start technologies for large-scale carbon abatement, such as carbon capture and storage. But these incentives should taper away over time, so costs are driven down and the market can take over as quickly as possible. 
Finally, America must stop looking to others for the oil it needs and actively develop its own hydrocarbon endowment. Even with the rapid growth of alternatives, fossil fuels will continue providing most of the energy Americans consume for decades into the future. 
The search for new sources of domestic crude has been constrained by a lack of access to promising areas, notably the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Resource estimates for closed areas exceed 100 billion barrels of oil, with 30 billion recoverable with today's technology and at today's prices. 
Opening up the OCS would enhance America's energy security. Moreover, a new study by ICF International estimates that it could create as many as 76,000 new jobs and generate a total of nearly $1.4 trillion in new government revenue by 2030. 
No one in the energy business thinks America can drill its way to energy security. But a policy based exclusively or even primarily on conservation and efficiency is a recipe for ongoing scarcity and economic decline. 
The prize is great and the time is right. When the world economy begins to recover -- and it will -- demand for energy will rise and the moment will likely have passed. We are extending our hand. We hope Washington policy makers will grasp it.

Abstract 
Officially recognizing that carbon dioxide is a danger to the public would require the government, under the Clean Air Act, to draw up regulations governing greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, refineries, chemical plants, cement firms, vehicles and any other emitting sectors. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's climate czar said the Environmental Protection Agency will soon determine that carbon-dioxide emissions represent a danger to the public and propose new rules to regulate emissions of the greenhouse gas from a range of industries. 
Carol Browner, special adviser to the president on climate change and energy, said in an interview Sunday that the EPA is looking at a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that requires the agency to determine whether carbon dioxide endangers public health or welfare. And the agency "will make an endangerment finding," she said. 
"The next step is a notice of proposed rule making" for new regulations on carbon-dioxide emissions, said Ms. Browner, speaking on the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. 
Officially recognizing that carbon dioxide is a danger to the public would require the government, under the Clean Air Act, to draw up regulations governing greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, refineries, chemical plants, cement firms, vehicles and any other emitting sectors. 
Administration officials have said they would limit regulation to facilities over a certain size. But legal experts say designating carbon dioxide a public danger could open up any emitters to legal challenge. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have been lobbying the EPA for months against trying to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, warning that such action would lead to costly new regulations affecting not only coal plants and large manufacturers but also schools, apartment buildings and hospitals. 
"Once carbon dioxide is regulated, they can no longer contain the Clean Air Act . . . and it would completely shut the country down," said William Kovacs, a chamber vice president. 
Speaking to governors and reporters later Sunday, Ms. Browner said the administration also is seeking to establish a national policy for auto emissions that could mean tougher efficiency mandates for auto makers. The White House said Sunday that the standard would be developed as part of the continuing restructuring negotiations between the government and major auto makers. 
Ms. Browner's comments provided the clearest outline to date of the Obama administration's regulatory strategy for tackling global warming. But critics warned that moving too quickly and aggressively could cripple an already ailing economy, and some business groups vowed to step up their fight against the proposed changes. 
Some Democratic lawmakers, mainly from states dependent on coal or manufacturing, are also leery of letting the EPA regulate emissions. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), a longtime advocate for Michigan's auto makers, has warned of "a glorious mess." 
Ms. Browner dismissed criticism that the administration's proposed moves would exacerbate the current recession. She said businesses hoping to invest in carbon-dioxide­mitigation projects need clearer policy direction before investing. 
Ms. Browner declined to say when the EPA would act on the endangerment issue, but EPA chief Lisa Jackson has indicated it could be on April 2, the anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency. 
The White House has separately been pressing Congress to pass legislation that would aim to cut greenhouse gases to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. It has threatened to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate these gases if legislators don't move fast enough. 
Based on government data, calculations suggest that such a reduction would be equivalent to taking several hundred conventional coal-fired power plants out of service, possibly more than all 600-plus coal stations currently in the U.S. 
Ms. Browner said that even though the EPA will move forward with its rule making, the administration prefers that Congress draft legislation that could more deftly regulate carbon dioxide through a cap-and-trade system. 
Under such a system, emitters would be required to cut their carbon-dioxide emissions every year. Those exceeding their emissions limits could buy credits on a newly created market. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said Friday that he aims to pass a climate-change bill by the end of the summer; Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), head of the House panel responsible for drafting such a bill, said he wants it approved in May. 
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp., one of the nation's largest generators of energy, including from coal-fired power plants, said the company believed the best way to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions was through congressional legislation, not the Clean Air Act. "It's best not to try and shoehorn climate rules in a law passed 18 years ago, as there are too many implications on the economy," he said. 
Ms. Browner said the administration had directed the EPA and the Department of Transportation to develop a national policy for auto emissions. The DOT is developing new efficiency standards, but Ms. Browner indicated that the administration could look for guidance to a set of strict emissions standards proposed by California. 
The administration is considering a request from California to implement its proposed standards, which would also consider cars' greenhouse-gas emissions, as opposed to just fuel efficiency, a move that a dozen other states are likely to follow. 
Ford Motor Co. spokesman Mike Moran said his company supported a national policy, but without knowing the details of the administration's plan, he couldn't comment on how it would affect his firm. Like other car companies, Ford has said in the past that California's proposals were too aggressive. 
Wade Newton, a spokesman for the U.S. Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said his organization has been seeking a national policy, but warned that auto makers continue to face unprecedented challenges, as car sales tumble and manufacturers' costs continue to rise. 
"A single national standard that pulls all of our interests and efforts together will allow us to continue our work bringing consumers across the country more fuel-efficient automobiles," he said in an email.

WASHINGTON, D.C. Reid to Push for Vote On Climate-Change Bill Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) aims by the end of the summer to debate -- and potentially pass -- a climate-change bill that would put a cost on emitting 
greenhouse gases, his office said Friday. 
A climate bill failed in the chamber last year, but Democrats now have a larger majority, and Mr. Reid's ambition is in step with the agenda of President Barack Obama, who 
wants to cut greenhouse gases 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. 
Climate-change legislation could face challenges in the Senate, where concerns about putting a high cost on carbon-dioxide emissions crosses party and regional lines. 

Democratic senators from states that have heavy manufacturing, automobile plants and coal-fired power plants could be at odds with Democrats from the West and Northeast. 

Critics of putting an expensive premium on carbon say that such a schedule may be overly optimistic, given the global financial crisis, and the potential impact putting a cap on 
greenhouse gases would have across nearly every sector of the economy.

CALIFORNIA Drought Forces U.S. to Halt Water Deliveries to Farms Federal water managers said Friday they plan to cut off water, at least temporarily, to thousands of California farms as a result of the deepening drought in the state. 
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation officials said parched reservoirs and patchy rainfall this year were forcing them to completely stop surface-water deliveries for at least a two-week period beginning March 1. 
Authorities said they haven't had to take such an action for more than 15 years. 
Farmers in the nation's No. 1 agriculture state said the shortages would wreak havoc on the rural economy. They predicted the shortages would cause consumers to pay more 
for fruits and vegetables because they will have to be grown using more-expensive well water. 

The situation could improve slightly if more rain falls over the next few weeks, and officials will know by mid-March if they can update their projections to release more irrigation 
supplies to growers from behind the mountain dams where water is stored. 
The water shortages are so severe that many cities in the state are expected to start mandatory ration programs by the summer.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
White House Rules Out Tax 
Based on Miles Driven 
President Barack Obama won't adopt a policy to tax motorists based on how many miles they drive instead of how much gasoline they buy, his chief spokesman said Friday. 

Press secretary Robert Gibbs commented after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told the Associated Press that he wants to consider the idea, which has been proposed in some states but has angered many drivers. 
Gasoline taxes, which for nearly half a century have paid for the federal share of highway and bridge construction, can no longer be counted on to raise enough money to keep the nation's transportation system moving, Mr. LaHood said in an interview Thursday.

CALIFORNIA 
Appeals Court Rejects Law 
Restricting Videogame Sales 
A federal appeals court on Friday struck down a California law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent videogames to minors. 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 2005 law violates minors' rights under the Constitution's First and 14th amendments. The three-judge panel's unanimous 

ruling upholds an earlier ruling in U.S. District Court. The law was challenged shortly after it was signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and never took effect. 
The law would have prohibited the sale or rental of violent games to anyone under 18. It also would have created strict labeling requirements for videogame manufacturers. 
In a written opinion, Judge Consuelo Callahan said there were less restrictive ways to protect children from "unquestionably violent" videogames.

GULF COAST 
Obama Keeps Open Office 
Aiding Katrina Rebuilding 
President Barack Obama extended the life of a federal office coordinating Gulf Coast reconstruction from Hurricane Katrina, saying area residents "have not always received the 

support they deserve" from Washington. 
The Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding, which had been scheduled to expire this month, will stay open at least through September. 
"The residents of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast . . . are succeeding despite the fact that they have not always received the support they deserve from the federal 

government," Mr. Obama said in a statement. 

The statement amounted to sharp though indirect criticism of former President George W. Bush's oversight of the recovery. The storm was blamed for more than 1,600 deaths and $41 billion in property damage. -- A WSJ News Roundup 
SPORTS Positive Drug Tests Barred From Bonds's Perjury Trial A federal judge ruled late Thursday that prosecutors cannot show jurors three positive steroid tests linked to Barry Bonds and other key evidence in the slugger's perjury trial 
next month. 
U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said the urine samples that tested positive for steroids are inadmissible because prosecutors cannot prove conclusively that they belong to Mr. 
Bonds. 
The judge said prosecutors need direct testimony from Greg Anderson, Mr. Bonds's personal trainer, to introduce such evidence. Mr. Anderson's attorney said the trainer will 
refuse to testify at Mr. Bonds's trial. 

Prosecutors couldn't be reached to determine whether they planned an appeal. 
Mr. Bonds has pleaded not guilty to lying to a grand jury on Dec. 4, 2003, when he denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs.

UTAH Lawmaker's Gay Comments Cost Him Leadership of Panel A Utah state senator on Friday was kicked off the judicial committee he led after he drew criticism for comparing gay activists to radical Muslims in an interview aired this week. "Muslims are good people and their religion is antiwar," Republican Sen. Chris Buttars said in an interview with a documentary producer. "But it's been taken over by the radical 
side. And the gays are totally taken over by the radical side." 
The comments by drew calls for Mr. Buttars's resignation in Utah and elsewhere. Mr. Buttars said Friday he wouldn't be issuing an apology.

PENNSYLVANIA 
Planners Pledge Memorial 
To Flight 93 Will Open by '11 
Government officials and representatives of the passengers and crew killed when United Flight 93 crashed in a rural Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001, pledged to dedicate a memorial there by the attacks' 10th anniversary. Plans for a memorial at the site near Shanksville, about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, have been in the works for years. But construction hasn't begun, as arguments over the memorial's design and problems buying land have slowed development.

Abstract 
Canada's concerns over Mr. Obama's pledge to reopen Nafta have been exacerbated by a provision in the president's just-passed $787 billion economic-stimulus package that stipulates that certain building materials for infrastructure projects funded by the plan come from U.S. suppliers. 

Full Text 
OTTAWA -- President Barack Obama, in his first foreign trip, sought to reassure Canada that he had no intention of turning some of his campaign rhetoric on trade into actual barriers between the U.S. and its largest trading partner. 
"Now is a time where we've got to be very careful about any signals of protectionism, because as the economy of the world contracts, I think there's going to be a strong impulse, on the part of constituencies in all countries, to see if they can engage in beggar-thy-neighbor policies," Mr. Obama said. 
Visiting Canada has traditionally been the first trip for a new U.S. president. In his daylong trip here, Mr. Obama touched upon an array of bilateral concerns, from trade to a declining North American auto industry to Afghanistan, where Canadian combat forces are set to leave by mid-2011. 
He capped the visit with a joint appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that highlighted some strains that have developed between the two sides in recent years. Mr. Harper took some apparent swipes at the Bush administration's position on climate change, noting that Washington was only now forming a comprehensive policy on the environment and energy. 
"I will be watching what's done in the United States with great interest," the Canadian leader said. "But I'm quite optimistic that we now have a partner on the North American continent that will provide leadership to the world on the climate-change issue." 
Mr. Harper also questioned whether the North American Free Trade Agreement could be reopened, as Mr. Obama had pledged to do during the campaign, without "unraveling what is a very complex agreement." Mr. Obama reiterated his belief that Nafta side agreements on environmental and labor standards should be incorporated into the main agreement to ensure enforcement. 
"My hope is that as our advisers and staffs and economic teams work this through, that there's a way of doing this that is not disruptive to the extraordinarily important trade relationships that exist between the United States and Canada," Mr. Obama said. He repeatedly stressed his commitment to open trade between the U.S. and Canada. 
Canada's concerns over Mr. Obama's pledge to reopen Nafta have been exacerbated by a provision in the president's just-passed $787 billion economic-stimulus package that stipulates that certain building materials for infrastructure projects funded by the plan come from U.S. suppliers. The plan says the provision must be carried out in accordance with the U.S.'s obligations under the World Trade Organization, but questions remain over how the two mandates can be reconciled. 
Mr. Obama had criticized Nafta on the campaign trail last year in hard-hit industrial states, where many people blame the trade deal for robbing the U.S. of manufacturing jobs. 
U.S.-Canada relations are likely to become a testing ground for Mr. Obama's efforts to balance the demands of his liberal and labor backers with the broader considerations and sensitivities he must consider as president. Before his departure, some labor and progressive groups sent a letter to Mr. Obama urging him to stand by his Nafta pledge. 
Environmentalists are pushing Mr. Obama to take a firm stand against Canada's already ailing oil-sands industry, which emits more greenhouse gases in the production of oil than are emitted in the production of ordinary crude. Mr. Obama brought along his energy czar, Carol Browner, who is expected to push hard for policies to address climate change. 
The two leaders announced an agreement to begin a clean-energy dialogue. White House aides had said Mr. Obama would bring up his effort to advance research into technologies that capture carbon emissions and trap them underground, even from dirty fuel sources, such as Canadian oil sands and U.S. coal. The stimulus plan provides $3.5 billion for developing carbon capture and sequestration technology. 
Denis McDonough, Mr. Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the president would also press for the tougher greenhouse-gas reduction targets advocated by Mexican President Felipe Calderon. 
On Afghanistan -- where Mr. Obama has pledged to increase U.S. troop presence by about 50% -- the president didn't push Canada to rethink its plans to withdraw its troops. Instead, he said he praised Canada for its sacrifices and for making Afghanistan its largest recipient of foreign aid. 
Ottawa has said it won't renew its troop commitment to a conflict that has killed 108 Canadian soldiers.

Full Text 
In signing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act this week in Denver, President Barack Obama claimed that the law -- which among other things will ramp up funding for renewable energy development -- is "laying the groundwork for new green energy economies that can create countless well-paying jobs." 
This statement follows promises he made during his campaign for the presidency. Mr. Obama said, for example, that he'd create as many as five million such jobs by investing over $150 billion over 10 years on wind, solar, biofuels and other renewable energy sources. 
He's also proposed a federal "renewable portfolio standard" that would require 25% of our electricity to come from clean sources -- a mandate that would boost demand for windmills, solar farms, and other clean but expensive technologies (nuclear power, however, would be excluded). This transformed energy economy, Mr. Obama said at a campaign debate in Nashville, Tenn., last October, would be an "engine of economic growth" to rival the computer. 
If the green-jobs claim sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. 
There's an unavoidable problem with renewable-energy technologies: From an economic standpoint, they're big losers. Renewables simply cannot produce the large volumes of useful, reliable energy that our economy needs at attractive prices, which is exactly why government subsidizes them. 
The subsidies involved are considerable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported in early 2008 that the government subsidizes solar energy at $24.34 per megawatt-hour (MWh) and wind power at $23.37 per MWh. Yet even with decades of these massive handouts, as well as numerous state-level mandates for utilities to use green power, wind and solar energy contribute less than 1% of our nation's electricity. 
Compare the subsidies to renewables with those extended to natural gas (25 cents per MWh in subsidies), coal (44 cents), hydroelectricity (67 cents), and nuclear power ($1.59). These are the energy sources (along with oil, which undergirds transportation) that do the heavy lifting in our energy economy. 
The alternative technologies at the heart of Mr. Obama's plan, relying on mandates and far greater handouts, will inevitably raise energy prices -- and high power prices are job killers. Industries that make physical products, whether cars or chemicals or paper cups, are energy-intensive and gravitate to low-cost-energy locales. 
With some of the highest electricity prices in the country, California and New York have hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs. California-based Google houses its massive server farms in states like North Carolina and Oregon, which have lower electricity costs. Policies that drive up energy costs nationwide, as Mr. Obama intends, will inevitably drive more manufacturing jobs overseas. 
What about jobs in the traditional industries currently supplying Americans with reliable, affordable energy? The American Petroleum Institute reports that the oil and gas industry employs 1.6 million Americans. Coal mining directly and indirectly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, according to the National Mining Association and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A radical plan to transform our energy economy will put an untold number of these men and women out of work. 
Digging deeper each month to pay for expensive renewable energy, consumers will have less to save or spend in other areas of the economy. Killing jobs in efficient industries to create jobs in inefficient ones is hardly a recipe for economic success. There may be legitimate arguments for taking dramatic steps to fight climate change. Boosting the economy isn't one of them.

Abstract 
If successful, it would become the country's first near-zero emissions coal-fired power plant, a key step as the world struggles to confront global warming. [...] Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the project's strongest backer in Congress and one of Mr. Obama's earliest supporters, made sure to cut from the compromise bill even the most oblique references to it. 

Full Text 
MATTOON, Illinois -- Most cities will consider themselves lucky to get a new viaduct or a freshened-up high school once Washington's $787 billion in stimulus money starts flowing. 
But that is small change for this railroad town 190 miles south of Chicago. People here are fishing for something far greater: a $1.8 billion high-tech power plant, called FutureGen, long sought by the state's politicians and the town with a population of 18,000. 
Conservatives have blasted the project as the mother of all "earmarks" -- funds written into legislation in a way that they could only go to one particular project, rather than being available for multiple uses. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have pledged to keep the bill free of such pet projects, so Democratic backers of FutureGen have done their best to disguise it in the bill. 
But hidden in the 1,073-page plan is an obscure phrase setting aside $1 billion for "fossil energy research" that lawmakers say is almost certain to head Mattoon's way as a down-payment on FutureGen. 
"That money has to be for a clean-coal plant, and we have the only one that's ready to go," said Angela Griffin, who has led the FutureGen charge as head of the Coles County economic-development group, called Coles Together. 
At Common Grounds, a coffee shop downtown, several of the town fathers picked over stacks of congressional documents fresh off the Internet to find out the fate of their project. They were steamed at accusations that the power plant, to be built in a field about two miles west of town, smacked of favoritism or pork. 
"After all the local and state work that went into this, that just isn't right," said David Cline, a retired policeman who is now Mattoon's mayor. "We have worked for this, and earned it." 
There is little doubt that FutureGen dovetails with the objectives of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan of quickly creating jobs while helping the environment. Construction would begin within months, employing around 3,000 people. The experimental plant would gasify different kinds of coal, extract hydrogen for commercial purposes, and then inject -- or "sequester" -- the leftover carbon dioxide into rock formations deep underground. If successful, it would become the country's first near-zero emissions coal-fired power plant, a key step as the world struggles to confront global warming. Carbon dioxide contributes to that problem because it traps the sun's rays in the earth's atmosphere. 
But some Republicans have called FutureGen the prime example of how Mr. Obama hasn't lived up to his no-earmarks pledge. Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma lambasted the project in a statement last week as "the biggest earmark in history," saying it was "not ready for prime time." 
Others have said it would dwarf Alaska's infamous Bridge to Nowhere, a $223 million earmark linking the state's mainland to a sparsely populated island. 
The project has long had the backing of the state's congressional delegation, including Mr. Obama when he was in the Senate, and his White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, when he was in the House. But speaking with PBS's Charlie Rose last month, Mr. Emanuel cited FutureGen as an example of how Mr. Obama was willing to "help put some skin in the game" by keeping the project out of the stimulus bill, even if it was an "important investment for America's future." 
In the end, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the project's strongest backer in Congress and one of Mr. Obama's earliest supporters, made sure to cut from the compromise bill even the most oblique references to it. While the Senate bill mentioned "one or more near-zero emissions power plants," the compromise package talked only of "fossil energy research." 
Mr. Durbin -- the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate -- said that as negotiations dragged on, he "got sick and tired" of accusations that he was pushing an earmark. "So I said, 'Take the language out,' and we made it as general as possible." 
Mr. Durbin said he has no assurances that the $1 billion will go to FutureGen. "But I am confident in the merits of this project," he said. 
The project's genesis goes back to the early days of President George W. Bush's administration, when he decided in 2003 to champion the clean use of coal by backing a big demonstration project to sequester carbon dioxide. The Energy Department joined with the FutureGen Industrial Alliance Inc., a nonprofit group of 13 big power and coal companies. 
A lengthy site competition ended in December 2007, when Mattoon beat out another Illinois site and two in Texas. Illinois's recently ousted governor, Rod Blagojevich, came for the announcement bash, where hundreds packed the downtown Time Theater. 
A month later, though, the administration stunned Mattoon by pulling the plug on the project, saying it had become too expensive and that the Energy Department wanted to fund several smaller clean-coal experiments instead. 
Mattoon decided to fight on. In a month, the county raised $3 million in pledges from local residents and businesses to start securing 440 acres needed to build the plant. Businessman Gene Bauer, 94 years old, pledged $50,000. Every month he signs over his $3,333 Social Security check. "This is the best thing that's ever happened around here," he said. 
After the ups and downs of the past year, few in Mattoon are ready quite yet to bank on the largess of the stimulus bill. FutureGen Chief Executive Michael Mudd said he remains "on pins and needles." But if there is "a pot of money to make this happen," he said, "then we will make our case for having some of that."

Abstract 
Many rural areas in Australia may be more fire-prone than before -- a phenomenon some scientists attribute to climate change. Since 1950, Australia's temperatures have risen and rainfall has declined in population centers, including parts of western and southeastern Australia. 

Full text 
The wildfires that have so far claimed more than 170 lives in Australia highlight the vulnerabilities in countries where populations are spilling into rural areas already under stress from sometimes extreme weather conditions. 
Police suspect arsonists played a role in starting at least some of the blazes in Australia, contributing to one of the worst natural disasters in the country's history. 
Investigators fanned out across the region Tuesday. In some places, officials still struggled to contain the flames, which obliterated at least two towns over the weekend and continued to burn in grasslands and forests north of Melbourne, the capital of the southeastern state of Victoria. On Tuesday fires were still being fought in 24 locations and winds were expected to pick up. 
Rural Australian communities like the ones north of Melbourne have had a steady influx of residents in recent years as former city dwellers have snapped up farmland to escape urban hassles without having to move too far. Similar shifts have occurred in other places that are considered at high risk for fires, including California and other parts of the American West. 
Such newcomers are less familiar than longtime rural residents with precautions needed to prevent wildfires and are less prepared to escape when fires occur, Australian bush fire experts say. 
Many rural areas in Australia may be more fire-prone than before -- a phenomenon some scientists attribute to climate change. Since 1950, Australia's temperatures have risen and rainfall has declined in population centers, including parts of western and southeastern Australia. The scorched area around Melbourne has suffered from drought for roughly a decade, leaving grass and trees there dry and making it easier for flames to spread. 
Although Australia has always had wildfires, "climate change and drought are altering the nature, the ferocity and the duration of the bush fires," says Gary Morgan, chief executive of the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, an organization that manages bushfire research efforts in Australia. 
Abnormal conditions over the weekend are at least partly to blame for the fires. Temperatures soared to record highs, and humidity dropped unusually low. 
While the underlying weather patterns that led to the heat -- and some fires -- wasn't unusual, "it has never been that severe before," says Andrew Sullivan, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia's national science agency. 
Some scientists and environmentalists discount links to climate change, noting Australia has always had extreme weather, especially in rural regions. And while many scientists say the number of wildfires has increased, data on such phenomena are incomplete. 
The disaster is prompting environmentalists to step up calls for action. Australia is the biggest per-capita polluter in the developed world, primarily because it relies heavily on low-cost coal for power. 
When Prime Minister Kevin Rudd swept to power in November 2007, he had pledged to improve Australia's environmental credentials, setting a long-term target to reduce emissions by 60% from year-2000 levels by 2050. He has since softened his stance in light of the world-wide economic slowdown and the costs such changes would entail. 
Grisly details continued to emerge from the fires, with the latest death toll Tuesday morning in Australia at 173. Firefighters and forensics investigators blocked off many areas, including the town of Marysville, a village of 600 or so people that was almost totally incinerated over the weekend, leaving a dozen or more people dead. 
Many bodies found in the region were burned beyond recognition. Some were near abandoned vehicles, as people were apparently trapped by flames as they tried to get away. Dead animals littered roads. The fires destroyed more than 750 houses and scorched more than 815,000 acres of land, according to news reports. 
Survivors recounted tales of near-death experiences. Some hid in creek beds or dived into reservoirs to escape the flames, while others who sped away in cars escaped just in time. 
Andrew Wallace, a 45-year-old property consultant with a vineyard near one of the affected areas, says he could see smoke from the fires early Saturday morning. Then, "this absolutely massive wind" swept across the area, he says, unsettling cows and sending kangaroos scampering across the paddocks. A fireman advised him to get out quickly. "You could see the whole of the mountain was ablaze," he recalls. 
Mr. Wallace's property was spared. But the flames destroyed many homes nearby, leaving several people dead.

Abstract 
Change Investments LLC, founded by Russell Read, the former chief investment officer at California Public Employees' Retirement System, led a $30 million round of financing in NC12 Inc., a Houston-based developer of technology to produce synthetic natural gas from coal, petroleum coke and biomass.

Underground Investing 
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who backs aggressive steps to address climate change, has described coal as his "worst nightmare," but some clean-technology investors are taking a more nuanced view. 
They see coal playing a major role in the nation's future energy plans because there are huge reserves of it in the U.S. The companies they are backing, however, are developing technologies designed to harness coal's energy without releasing pollutants and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is what happens now when coal is burned to make electricity. 
One Equity Partners and Green Growth Fund-Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers' later-stage investment vehicle- recently led a $75.9 million round of funding for Golden, Colo.­based Luca Technologies Inc., which has developed a process for reviving old coal beds and natural-gas wells by stimulating the growth of micro- organisms that convert coal into methane underground. Previous investors Kleiner Perkins, BASF Group and Oxford Bioscience Partners LP also participated in the Series C round, one of the largest venture-capital rounds of the fourth quarter. 
Although not a renewable resource, underground coalgasification offers several benefits over traditional coal mining, some analysts say. Alex Klein, a research director at the clean-tech industry research organization Emerging Energy Research, says underground gasification reduces the impact of mining, and produces a natural gas that has a slightly lower emissions profile when used as a fuel. In addition, underground gasification can be used in conjunction with technologies that capture and contain carbon dioxide, preventing its escape into the atmosphere. 
Luca, which operates primarily in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming, has restored 108 depleted natural- gas wells as part of a project that, according to a letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer Robert Pfeiffer, has produced approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet of new gas. Luca will use money from the new round of financing to acquire leases, wells and production assets. The company currently operates more than 630 wells and is involved in 20 well-reclamation projects monthly. 
Laurus Energy Inc. of Houston, which recently emerged from stealth mode and is backed by Mohr Davidow Ventures, also is aiming to gasify coal underground. 
Erik Straser, a managing director at Mohr Davidow who sits on the Laurus board, says underground gasification can increase the nation's energy reserves by providing access to coal that is too deep to be mined. It "opens up new, previously unminable coal reserves, of which we have an abundance in America," he says. 
Builders See Green 
Government and private-sector influences are spurring growth in the "green building" market, which entails making new and existing buildings more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient. 
The U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded $80 million in contracts to 16 companies to improve the energy efficiency of government buildings. Green building also is expected to be a theme of any infrastructure-spending package introduced by the Obama administration. And in the private sector, home builders report that "green" houses are selling better than others in a weak market. 
With these expanding markets in mind, Navitas Capital is raising a fund of between $35 million and $50 million focused entirely on green-building technology companies. 
"We will be investing in early stage technology companies that have a unique innovation for the green-building market, and that can be anywhere from the materials that go into the building, to the systems that operate the building, to the information-management side of the building," says Travis Putnam, managing partner of the Berkeley, Calif.­based firm. 
In recent weeks, Rockport Capital Partners led an $8 million Series B round of investment in Project Frog Inc., a San Francisco-based firm that designs energy-efficient buildings. Synergy Walls LLC of Coralville, Iowa, which plans five manufacturing plants to produce a type of foam that increases the energy efficiency of concrete walls, is raising $22 million in venture-capital financing. And Composite Technologies Corp. of Boone, Iowa, has signed a contract with an unnamed venture firm for as much as $100 million in financing in early 2009. The company makes a foam and connector technology called Thermomass that makes concrete more energy efficient. 
What Else Is New 
Here's a look at other recent deals reported by Clean Technology Insight: 

Change Investments LLC, founded by Russell Read, the former chief investment officer at California Public Employees' Retirement System, led a $30 million round of financing in NC12 Inc., a Houston-based developer of technology to produce synthetic natural gas from coal, petroleum coke and biomass. 
Ice Energy Inc. of Windsor, Colo., received $33 million from private-equity firm Energy Capital Partners, underlining the continued appeal to investors of energy-storage companies. Ice Energy's energy-storage system makes ice at night, when there is less demand for energy and temperatures are cooler, and uses it during the day to power air conditioners, reducing the load on utilities.

Abstract 
The new document issued by the State Council, China's equivalent of the cabinet, spelled out in greater detail the goals of the project, which aims to reduce the gap between urban and rural residents in Chongqing, the sprawling megalopolis carved out of western China's Sichuan province to help absorb the millions of people displaced by the dam on the Yangtze River. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- New questions arose about China's dam building boom rose as a recently released government plan said some of the 1.4 million farmers relocated to make way for the Three Gorges Dam would have to move again. 
The plan for the relocation and urbanization of farmers living near the Three Gorges Reservoir was published online by the government Thursday and includes some of the most pointed acknowledgments of the problems created by the forced migration of 1.4 million people to make way for the world's biggest dam. 
The plan, part of broader efforts to reduce pollution along the 400-mile long reservoir and raise living standards for millions of farmers by encouraging them to resettle, was approved two years ago. 
The new document issued by the State Council, China's equivalent of the cabinet, spelled out in greater detail the goals of the project, which aims to reduce the gap between urban and rural residents in Chongqing, the sprawling megalopolis carved out of western China's Sichuan province to help absorb the millions of people displaced by the dam on the Yangtze River. 
"Problems left over from migration and resettlement must be dealt with in detail, helping migrants to solve the real hardships and problems in their work and lives, so as to build a harmonious and stable dam area," the report says. 
The issue, along with the possibility that another giant dam may have triggered the earthquake in Sichuan province, raises questions about ambitious dam-building projects across China's earthquake-prone western regions. 
China, the world's biggest dam builder, is eager to tap into a clean source of energy to fuel a growing economy now largely reliant on coal-fired power plants. China is planning to double its hydropower capacity by 2020 -- the equivalent of adding another Three Gorges dam every two years, according to a recent report by the Asia Society and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.

World News: Sweden Set to Overturn Ban on Nuclear Power

Abstract 
If lawmakers approve the bill, Sweden will join a growing list of countries rethinking their opposition to nuclear energy, as unease about global warming and oil prices outweighs fears about the safety of nuclear installations. 

Full Text 
Sweden says it will overturn a ban on building new nuclear-power stations, in a further sign of how concerns about climate change and energy security are fueling a nuclear renaissance across Europe. 
Swedes voted to phase out nuclear power in 1980, shortly after the Three Mile Island accident in the U.S. Since then, two of the country's 10 reactors have been shut down. But Sweden's coalition government said on Thursday that it will present a bill to parliament in March calling a halt to the phase-out and allowing nuclear construction, as part of a new climate and energy policy. 
Sweden now has 10 reactors, which produce just under half of the country's electricity. 
If lawmakers approve the bill, Sweden will join a growing list of countries rethinking their opposition to nuclear energy, as unease about global warming and oil prices outweighs fears about the safety of nuclear installations. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear plants don't emit much of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. 
The shift took on greater urgency after the European gas crisis last month, when a pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine led to a halt in supplies of Russian natural gas to Eastern Europe in midwinter, prompting fresh calls for the European Union to diversify its sources of energy away from Russia. 
The spat "helped people to understand what security of supply means . . . and how risky it is to be so dependent on imports for your energy needs," said Luis Echavarri, director-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. 
In the wake of the crisis, Slovakia, which is heavily dependent on Russian gas, moved to reopen an obsolete, Soviet-type nuclear reactor it had closed as a condition of joining the European Union. It later reversed the decision after Russian gas started flowing again. 
Similarly, Bulgaria sought EU permission to resurrect two old reactors of Soviet design that it mothballed when it joined the bloc two years ago. 
But even before the Russia-Ukraine spat, European countries were shifting their stance on nuclear power. 
Italy, which prohibited nuclear power in 1987 after the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, moved last year to lift the ban. Poland, worried about its heavy dependence on coal for generation of electricity, has announced plans to build its first nuclear-power station. The U.K. last year gave the go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear-power stations to replace the nine that are due to be retired by 2023. 
But some countries have ditched plans to expand nuclear capacity, as the economic downturn reduces the appetite for big, capital-intensive energy projects, damps demand for electricity, and brings down the price of alternatives such as oil, gas and coal. 
In December, South Africa's Eskom suspended bidding for the country's second nuclear reactor, saying the huge capital costs made the project nonviable. 
Still, the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency predicts that the share of nuclear power in global electricity production will rise to 22% in 2050 from 16% today. But that scenario is based on a long list of assumptions, such as an increase in public concerns about climate change and security of supply, disappointing results from renewable energy, rising public acceptance of nuclear power, and successful carbon-trading systems.

Abstract 
The industry is thought to have bright prospects for the next few decades as global-warming fears push governments to rein in the use of fossil fuels and to start or restart nuclear-power programs. 

Full Text 
Siemens AG on Monday will announce its withdrawal from a joint venture with France's nuclear giant Areva SA, people familiar with the situation said. 
The venture, Areva NP, is the world's largest maker of nuclear-power reactors by revenue. Siemens will decide to sell its 34% interest in Areva NP at a board meeting Monday, these people said. 
The German conglomerate's decision will bring to an end a 10-year partnership with Areva and could trigger a restructuring of France's nuclear industry. The industry is thought to have bright prospects for the next few decades as global-warming fears push governments to rein in the use of fossil fuels and to start or restart nuclear-power programs. 
Yet, Siemens's pullout presents a financing problem for Areva. The Siemens stake is valued at 2.1 billion euros ($2.73 billion) on Areva's books, and Areva is obliged to buy it back according to terms of a 1999 agreement. In addition, Areva needs to invest heavily to take advantage of increased demand for its products and services. 
That leaves the French government with a dilemma: It hasn't got the funds, but is still eager to retain control over what it regards as a strategic company. 
Areva Chief Executive Officer Anne Lauvergeon has said she would like to raise about 3 billion euros through a capital increase that would dilute the French government's stake but leave it with a majority holding. The weak state of world financial markets would make that difficult now. 
In recent years, Siemens had sought to convert its interest in Areva NP into a stake in parent company Areva. In 2007, the French government made clear its opposition to such a move, unless Germany reversed a decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats agreed in 2005 to uphold the phase-out plan. But many in her party fear that losing nuclear energy will leave Germany short of electricity, or more dependent on high-polluting brown coal and Russian gas. 
French officials said the government would take a fresh look at a proposal by Alstom SA, a French maker of high-speed trains and power-generation plants. Alstom is offering to create a vast heavy-engineering conglomerate by combining Alstom and Areva in a single entity. 
But Ms. Lauvergeon recently said the Alstom proposal "won't bring much synergy and Alstom won't give me the cash I need."

Abstract 
Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Wednesday he wasn't surprised by the nominees' comments and noted that a 2007 Supreme Court ruling obligated the Obama administration to eventually determine whether greenhouse-gas emissions endanger health or welfare, the legal trigger for regulating them under the federal Clean Air Act.

WASHINGTON -- Big Coal is on a roll in the nation's capital, winning early rounds this week in what promises to be a long fight over fossil fuels and climate change. 
Despite a well-funded ad campaign by environmentalists attacking the industry, and a huge coal-ash spill in Tennessee that has led to calls for more regulation, the industry has received positive assurances this week from President-elect Barack Obama's nominees that the new administration is committed to keeping coal a big part of the nation's energy source. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama's choice to lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, described coal to a Senate panel as "a vital resource" for the country. A day earlier, Mr. Obama's nominee to run the Energy Department, physicist Steven Chu, referred to coal as a "great natural resource." Two years ago, he called the expansion of coal-fired power plants his "worst nightmare." 
The comments indicated the new administration is trying to steer toward the center in the debate over the costs associated with curbing fossil fuels and the greenhouse gases they produce. 
Environmental groups are ratcheting up attacks on the industry. Last month, a group led by former Vice President Al Gore ran a national TV and print ad campaign lampooning the promise of so-called clean-coal technology and suggesting it would be risky for the U.S. to hold off on regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions until such technology becomes commercially available. 
Coal-fired power plants account for half of the U.S. electricity supply, and are one of the leading sources of U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 
Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Wednesday he wasn't surprised by the nominees' comments and noted that a 2007 Supreme Court ruling obligated the Obama administration to eventually determine whether greenhouse-gas emissions endanger health or welfare, the legal trigger for regulating them under the federal Clean Air Act. 
Addressing the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works, Ms. Jackson didn't say Wednesday how quickly her agency would reach that decision, but promised to "immediately revisit" the December 2007 order by current EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson to deny California and other states permission to implement their own controls on automobile greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Separately, an influential group of corporations and environmental groups is scheduled Thursday to ask that any federal limit on greenhouse-gas emissions not hit coal-burning power producers too hard. The U.S. Climate Action Partnership plans to ask Congress for mandates that would seek to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 42% below 2005 levels by 2030 and 80% below 2005 levels by 2050, according to a copy of the group's recommendations reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Corrections & Amplifications 
First Solar Inc.'s panels are priced lower than their crystalline silicon rivals because they have a lower energy-conversion efficiency rate, meaning more thin-film panels are 
needed to produce the same amount of electricity. An article in some editions Wednesday incorrectly said they have a better efficiency rate. 
(WSJ January 15, 2009) 
SAN FRANCISCO -- With its low-cost solar panels and growing manufacturing capacity, First Solar Inc. stands to gain an increasing share of the global solar-power market as 

concerns about the environment push governments to encourage greater use of renewable energy. 

First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., is the world's largest manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, a newer technology that claims about 10% of the solar-power market and is 
expected to grow in coming years. Analysts predict thin-film panel makers will gain on their rivals that manufacture conventional panels from polysilicon crystals. 
First Solar's panels are priced lower mainly because they have a better energy-conversion efficiency rate than their crystalline silicon rivals, meaning fewer thin-film panels are 

needed to produce the same amount of electricity. 

Utilities are investing more heavily in large-scale solar generation, driven by government incentives and requirements. President-elect Barack Obama last week proposed 
doubling U.S. production of alternative energy in the next three years and making government buildings and homes more energy-efficient. 
That statement Thursday helped push First Solar shares higher late last week, but the shares plummeted 13% Monday to $149.93 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading, down 

53% from their 52-week high of $317 reached in May and up 76% from their low of $85.28 in November. 

By comparison, shares of rival SunPower Corp., based in San Jose, Calif., fell 9.8% Monday on the Nasdaq to $34.89, off 70% from their 52-week high of $117.60 and up 89% 
from the low of $18.50. 
This week's weakness in solar stocks followed downward revisions in earnings forecasts by Wall Street analysts. 
Germany and Spain, the largest solar-power markets, offer lucrative government incentives for solar power, while Japan, Italy and other countries also offer incentives, with 

more countries expected to follow. 

As governments around the world look for ways to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and meet growing power demand with cleaner, more predictably priced generation, solar 
power should blossom, with front-runners First Solar and SunPower seen taking off. 
The outlook comes with the caveat that the next few months could be difficult for solar, along with other industries, as tight credit markets and the global economic downturn 

slow demand. But strong companies like First Solar are expected by analysts to weather the storm and emerge from the recession in a more dominant position. 

"We think First Solar is the best company in the solar sector," said Jesse Pichel, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in New York. He has a $200 share-price target for 
First Solar. 
As a "first mover," First Solar could tower over its rivals as both the markets and the company expand, Mr. Pichel said. "Longer term, solar has to be equal to or less than the 

price of a coal plant, and we think that will happen and that First Solar will get there first." 
First Solar declined to comment because it is in a "quiet period" ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release, which hasn't been scheduled yet, said spokeswoman Lisa Morse. 
Piper Jaffray forecasts First Solar earnings of $1.25 a share for the fourth quarter, $3.83 for all of 2008 and $7.55 this year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expect 

earnings of $1.33 a share for the fourth quarter, $3.91 for 2008 and $7.29 this year, down four cents from last week's 2009 forecast. 
The financial crisis has taken a toll on solar companies and their stocks as project financing has become scarce and expensive, demand growth has slowed and solar-panel 
prices have dropped, leading to lower earnings projections. First Solar, despite its strong position, hasn't been spared from the downturn, although analysts expect the 
company's stock to rebound, while other solar stocks plumb lower levels. 

"In our view, estimates for [First Solar] . . . are fully discounting near-term weakness in fundamentals," said Vishal Shah, an analyst at Barclays Capital, in a note. First Solar will benefit from the weak dollar and its "competitive cost structure" on its projects in Europe, he said. Other solar-company stocks, including SunPower, haven't yet fully priced near-term difficulties such as lower panel prices and reduced demand, Mr. Shah said. 
First Solar's low cost of production is perhaps its greatest weapon. First Solar panels cost a little more than $1 a watt to make, and the company sells them for more than $2 a watt, yielding a 50% gross margin. That compares with crystalline silicon solar panels that sell on average for more than $2.50 a watt. 
First Solar panels deliver the lowest-cost solar electricity, according to analysts and Sempra Energy unit Sempra Generation, which hired First Solar to build a 10-megawatt solar farm in Boulder City, Nev., and is likely to tap the Arizona company to expand the facility, called El Dorado, to 60 megawatts, enough to power about 38,400 homes. 
"We think their product, for these central large-scale solar facilities like El Dorado . . . produces the lowest-cost electricity," said Mike Allman, president of Sempra Generation. 
Sempra said it hasn't made a decision on which company will be hired to expand its Boulder City solar plant, but spokesman Art Larson said that "First Solar has the best solution." Sempra will likely make a decision later this year. 
"You really need to look at the cost of generation," said Mark Bachman, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore., who has a share-price target of $364 for First Solar. 
Aside from the near-term worries about the effect of the economic downturn on vulnerable industries like solar power, the sector's outlook is bright. California utilities are required to get 20% of the power they sell from renewable sources by 2010, a requirement that is likely to get bumped up to 33% under pending legislation supported by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Arizona utilities are required to use renewables for 15% of their retail power by 2025. Twenty-four other states and the District of Columbia have renewable-power requirements, and many states have tax rebates and other incentives for businesses and homeowners to install solar generation. 
The federal government recently created a new 30% tax credit for utilities to invest in solar-power generation, and extended a 30% tax credit for commercial and residential solar systems. 
In addition to his pledge to expand renewable energy development, Mr. Obama has said he will establish climate-change legislation, which would make energy from fossil fuels more costly and provide a boost to solar and other renewable-energy technologies. 
While the long-term outlook for solar is bright, the coming year could be bumpy for solar companies if demand and solar-panel prices continue to fall. First Solar's low-cost panels and strong market position should give it an edge, analysts say. 
"If demand falls, all [solar] stocks will go down," said Mr. Bachman of Pacific Crest Securities. "Will First Solar outperform the group? Yes. But it won't do a one-eighty. It will go down less than the others."

Abstract 
The son of Chinese immigrants and a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics for helping develop ways to trap atoms by herding and subduing them with laser beams, Mr. Chu has warned that climate change will have dire economic and social consequences. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Steven Chu, President-elect Barack Obama's pick to lead the Energy Department, got a taste last week of what life in Washington would be like. 
Members of the Illinois congressional delegation met with the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Jan. 7 and pressured him to support renewed federal aid for a project in Mattoon, Ill., to build a virtually emissions-free, coal-fired power plant. The Bush administration cancelled funding for the project last year after budget overruns. 
Mr. Obama is building a significant part of his economic-recovery plan on a bet that the U.S. can dramatically change the way it powers its economy. And Mr. Chu has called the expansion of conventional, coal-fired generating plants his worst nightmare, adding that he isn't sure that the technology in the Illinois project represents a solution to coal's impact on the environment. 
But in last week's meeting he was noncommittal, assuring the delegation from his future boss's home state that he understood the importance of clean-coal research. "He kind of laughed and said one of the real challenges of this job is getting used to the people he's going to be working with in the government and the halls of Congress," said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin. 
It's one example of the issues Mr. Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, will face in seeking to reconcile the new administration's lofty promises with policy on the ground. 
He is scheduled to be in Washington Tuesday for a Senate hearing likely to focus on his scientific credentials and his warnings about the consequences of climate change. After Mr. Chu's expected confirmation, he will confront the challenge of using the relatively narrow formal scope of his agency's mission and budget as a platform for changing the way Americans think about energy. Mr. Chu lamented in a speech in Washington last year that many Americans "would rather have a granite countertop" than spend extra on energy efficiency. 
For all the enthusiasm that Mr. Chu's nomination has generated among environmentalists and scientists, the Energy Department has little formal power to affect the nation's energy choices. Most of the department's budget goes toward managing nuclear weapons and cleaning up former weapons labs. Its budget for research and development has plummeted since its peak of $6 billion in the Carter administration to $1.4 billion last year, according to a recent report by the Energy Security Leadership Council, a Washington-based group. 
Some of that money is tied up on projects that critics say are technically or economically unfeasible, but that the agency is obligated to pay for because they have been added to legislation by members of Congress. An analysis last year by the American Association for the Advancement of Science referred to the Energy Department as one of the most heavily earmarked domestic U.S. research-and-development agencies. 
The son of Chinese immigrants and a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics for helping develop ways to trap atoms by herding and subduing them with laser beams, Mr. Chu has warned that climate change will have dire economic and social consequences. As director of the Lawrence Berkeley lab, he focused on developing advanced biofuels and energy-efficient technologies. He helped shepherd the creation of a new energy biosciences institute, funded by oil giant BP PLC, despite skepticism from some at the university who were wary of its corporate funding. 
Mr. Chu declined through a spokeswoman last week to be interviewed. 
As energy secretary, Mr. Chu would play a key role in helping Mr. Obama execute his ambitious goals of doubling over three years the amount of U.S. wind, solar and geothermal generating capacity, currently around 25,000 megawatts. Mr. Obama's aides say his administration would do that partly through loan guarantees like those the Energy Department already administers. 
Skeptics, such as Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, say there isn't enough manufacturing capacity to produce the many wind turbines needed to make Mr. Obama's vision a reality. 
Mr. Obama also has pledged to raise $150 billion over the next 10 years for various clean-energy technologies and alternative fuels, with revenue generated by an emissions-trading system that would cap industries' greenhouse-gas emissions and force companies to pay to pollute. But legislation creating such a system isn't expected to pass Congress this year, and pressure is growing on Washington to figure out faster ways to pay for such projects.

The New Congress: Competing Priorities Will Shape Ambitious Agenda --- Democrats' Factions Could Stall Grand Plans

Abstract 
Democrats see the best chance in decades to expand health coverage, move toward energy independence, tackle climate change and re-regulate the financial-services industry. Underlying the recovery plan and the Democrats' other agenda items is a determination to shift the nation's economic balance of power back to workers and the middle class -­by making it easier for employees to unionize, pushing banks to restructure mortgages and rewrite credit rules, and providing health coverage to more people. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- The new Congress sweeps into town Tuesday with many members comparing themselves to the 1933 Congress that enacted much of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and changed the government's relationship to its citizenry. 
These times are very different from 1933, when the 73rd Congress enacted 16 major laws during Mr. Roosevelt's First 100 Days. Today's economy, for all its struggles, doesn't remotely resemble the turmoil of the Great Depression, with its 25% unemployment. Also, the public's appetite for broad change isn't yet clear. 
None of this is deterring the Democrats. Like the Congress of 76 years ago, they are converging on Washington with a popular new president, significant congressional majorities and, perhaps most important, a shaken public eager for government to try something new. 
"We are at a unique moment in history -- we have an opportunity that maybe comes only once in a generation," Rep. Henry Waxman said recently. "We may well turn out to be as historical as the Congress was in 1933." 
Democrats see the best chance in decades to expand health coverage, move toward energy independence, tackle climate change and re-regulate the financial-services industry. 
"We certainly have the obligation to attack big problems," says Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, sitting under a large photo of Mr. Roosevelt in his personal office. "We have been playing small-ball for a long time here." 
The first order of business on the Democrats' agenda will be acting on a two-year economic-stimulus package. Still under construction, the plan could be as large as $775 billion, and it could include about $300 billion in tax cuts, $350 billion in infrastructure spending and billions more in aid to states and other measures. Democratic leaders hope to have the bill on President-elect Barack Obama's desk by mid-February. 
Underlying the recovery plan and the Democrats' other agenda items is a determination to shift the nation's economic balance of power back to workers and the middle class -­by making it easier for employees to unionize, pushing banks to restructure mortgages and rewrite credit rules, and providing health coverage to more people. 
What's to stop the Democrats? There are serious obstacles, starting with the party itself, which is hardly unified. Some Democratic congressional factions, like the more-conservative Blue Dogs, are deeply suspicious of expanded federal spending. Democrats from old industrial states worry that colleagues from California want to be too hard on the auto industry. Coal-state Democrats fear the party's environmental wing will go too far with efforts to clamp down on fossil fuels. 
Republicans, meanwhile, have made it clear they won't simply accept whatever Democrats propose, unlike in Mr. Roosevelt's day. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, joined by House Minority Leader John Boehner, recently issued a statement demanding "the consideration of alternative ideas, public congressional hearings and transparency -­not a rushed, partisan take-it-or-leave-it approach." 
Some of what Congress wants to do may be obstructed by what it has to do. It must finish up the 2009 budget and debate the 2010 budget. When the Treasury Department seeks to release the second half of the $700 billion pool created to calm financial markets, Congress must debate whether to block the move or substantially revamp the program. 
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank said Congress would likely block the expenditure if brought up now. But Rep. Frank is studying "ways to make it more palatable," such as legislation to ensure the money is used to help with consumer needs such as student loans, auto purchases and mortgage relief. 
The most important factor in the Democrats' success will likely be whether the party's actions reflect the "change" voters had in mind when they voted Republicans out of power. 
Today, the public appears hungry for government action, but also wary. Nearly two-thirds of Americans support new spending to stimulate the economy, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found. At the same time, in a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, 56% worried the government would spend too much. 
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer sees a widespread desire to confront big problems after the Bush years. 
"People see that we have sort of been dithering while Rome has been burning, and we need to respond," Rep. Hoyer, of Maryland, said in an interview. 
But even if Democrats get virtually everything they want in the new Congress, it wouldn't amount to a "new New Deal." Instead, historians say the Democrats are really looking to revive and extend the fundamental approach behind Mr. Roosevelt's program, much as President Lyndon Johnson did in 1965 with programs like Medicare and Head Start. 
"What the Democrats are looking to is really the spirit of the New Deal," said David Woolner, a history professor at Marist College and executive director of the Franklin and 
Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. "It's the idea that government can play a role in engineering a socio-economic system that provides great security for everyday Americans."

Abstract 
In the two years since Al Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth," helped make climate change a marquee issue, companies from Timberland Co., the shoe maker, to News Corp., the owner of The Wall Street Journal, have promised to become "carbon neutral." Dell's drive offers an early road map of the thorny questions companies will face as they attempt the massive emission reductions scientists say are needed to curb global warming. 

Full text 
ROUND ROCK, Texas -- Computer giant Dell Inc. said this summer that it has become "carbon neutral," the latest step in its quest to be "the greenest technology company on the planet." 
What that means, and what it doesn't, may surprise Dell customers and other consumers who have been bombarded with bold environmental promises from major corporations. 
In the two years since Al Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth," helped make climate change a marquee issue, companies from Timberland Co., the shoe maker, to News Corp., the owner of The Wall Street Journal, have promised to become "carbon neutral." 
The term may suggest a company has reengineered itself so that it's no longer adding to the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases scientists say are contributing to climate change. The experience of Dell, one of the few multinational corporations to claim it already has achieved carbon neutrality, shows the reality often falls short of that ideal. 
The amount of emissions Dell has committed to neutralize is known in the environmental industry as the company's "carbon footprint." But there is no universally accepted standard for what a footprint should include, and so every company calculates its differently. Dell counts the emissions produced by its boilers and company-owned cars, its buildings' electricity use, and its employees' business air travel. 
In fact, that's only a small fraction of all the emissions associated with Dell. The footprint doesn't include the oil used by Dell's suppliers to make its computer parts, the diesel and jet fuel used to ship those computers around the world, or the coal-fired electricity used to run them. 
Dell's announcement that it had achieved carbon neutrality didn't go into these details. But in an interview, Dell officials estimate that the emissions produced by its suppliers and consumers each amount to about 10 times the footprint Dell has defined for itself. That means the company is only neutralizing about 5% of the greenhouse gases that go into the making and use of its products. 
Moreover, while Dell is improving its energy efficiency, it is claiming carbon neutrality mostly by purchasing environmental "credits." These are financial instruments that bankroll environmental improvements made by others, such as running wind turbines or planting forests. Dell reasons that these credits cancel out the bulk of its carbon footprint. 
Yet some of those improvements would have occurred whether or not Dell invested in them, according to some of the companies involved. That suggests Dell isn't ridding the atmosphere of as much pollution as it claims. 
Dell says it's trying to set an example by reducing its environmental impact as responsibly and aggressively as it can. 
"There are skeptics of carbon neutrality who will say, 'That's kind of bogus,'" says Dane Parker, Dell's director of environment, health and safety. "Instead of using that as an excuse for inaction, we've said, 'There's a lot you can do.'" 
Mr. Parker says it wouldn't be feasible to include more emissions in the company's carbon footprint. He says many of Dell's suppliers haven't yet calculated their own emissions, and customers' contributions to the overall pie vary depending on how and where they use their computers. For now, Mr. Parker says, the best Dell can do is design computers that are as energy efficient as possible, and persuade its suppliers to reduce their own emissions. Dell has told its major suppliers that it plans to take their emission levels into account when deciding whether to continue doing business with them. 
Regarding the environmental credits Dell has bought, Mr. Parker says they "meet the highest standards" that currently exist. 
Indeed, Dell's program is widely praised by environmental groups as one of the most comprehensive attempts by a major corporation to combat climate change. The strategy mirrors the one that scientists and politicians are now prescribing: boosting energy-efficiency, funding renewable energy and buying carbon credits. 
Dell's drive offers an early road map of the thorny questions companies will face as they attempt the massive emission reductions scientists say are needed to curb global warming. In a global economy with so many interconnected players, figuring out who should be responsible for cutting which emissions -- and how to ensure those cuts happen -- is dizzyingly complicated. Amid that confusion, Dell's story illustrates the fuzziness of some of today's corporate environmental claims. 
Some observers say companies pledging carbon neutrality at this point could be jumping the gun. There's not yet uniform agreement on what should be counted in such programs, says Pankaj Bhatia, a policy expert at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental group that is working with many corporations, including Dell, to develop a standard for carbon neutrality. 
Dell is "going farther than most corporations" in trying to minimize its environmental impact, says Bill Burtis, spokesman for Clean Air-Cool Planet, a Portsmouth, N.H.-based nonprofit group that advises companies on how to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. But he says Dell's public descriptions of its pledge could lead consumers to the mistaken assumption that buying a Dell computer means they're not contributing to climate change at all. "If you're going to use the terminology of neutrality, you've got to be upfront about what that means," says Mr. Burtis. 
Other companies pledging to become carbon neutral include Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc., both of which say they are working to become more energy-efficient and are also buying offsets. Both companies include in their footprints such things as their facilities' electricity use and their employees' commuting and business air travel. Google also includes the emissions produced in the manufacturing of the servers that its data centers use, a Google official says. Yahoo doesn't include those emissions, a Yahoo spokeswoman says. 
Timberland and News Corp. have said they'll become carbon-neutral by 2010. They include in their footprints essentially the same things Dell does: boilers and vehicles, electricity use and employee business air travel. And both companies say they're trying to get suppliers to curb their emissions, too. 
For Timberland, its own carbon footprint represents a slice that "probably wouldn't even register in the pie chart" of all the emissions associated with the company and its products, but it's a first step, says Betsy Blaisdell, Timberland's manager for environmental stewardship. It doesn't count emissions produced by the company's suppliers, including the prodigious emissions that come from the production of leather. Cows, as they digest their food, burp out methane, a potent global-warming gas. 
Ms. Blaisdell estimates Timberland will satisfy about half of its carbon-neutral pledge by using energy more efficiently and buying renewable energy. For the other half, Timberland plans to buy credits, or offsets, which it says it's vetting for legitimacy. 
News Corp. hasn't computed how much of the total emissions associated with the company will be covered by the carbon footprint it has drawn. But that percentage is probably small, says Hugh Strange, a director of the company's energy initiatives. When News Corp. calculated the annual carbon footprint of its Dow Jones & Co. unit, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, for instance, it counted largely the emissions from the electricity the newspaper's offices and printing plants use and from employee business flights. It didn't include the emissions from making the newsprint or from delivering the newspapers. Its reasoning is much the same as Dell's and Timberland's: News Corp. doesn't control those parts of its supply chain. 
News Corp. was initially "kind of wary" of publicly setting a carbon-neutral goal, says Rachel Webber, another director of the company's energy initiatives. But, she says, it decided that making that kind of high-profile statement "was the single most dynamic way we could inspire people" to cut emissions. 
Dell's push dates to 2002, when environmentalists launched public protests against the company, saying Dell wasn't doing enough to encourage the recycling of its computers. In response, Dell launched extensive recycling programs. 
By late 2006, the company began discussing a climate-change program. Dell hired Mr. Parker, who at the time was Intel Corp.'s environmental director. It also set up an internal group of executives, called the Environment 2.0 Team, to deliver quarterly updates to Dell CEO Michael Dell. 
Dell first put the onus on its customers. It launched "Plant a Tree for Me," a program in which Dell's U.S. consumers can donate a few dollars to environmental groups that plant trees. Trees can compensate for emissions because they consume carbon dioxide as they grow. In 2007, the program offset about 4% of the expected emissions from the computers Dell sold to U.S. consumers, according to Wall Street Journal calculations using figures provided by Dell and technology research firm IDC. Dell declined to comment on that figure. 
In September 2007, Mr. Dell announced that the company was "going carbon-neutral." It installed more-efficient light bulbs and air conditioners in its buildings, and timers that turn off lights and computers at night and on weekends. It is also trying to cut down on employee air travel. These moves have reduced Dell's stated carbon-dioxide emissions by about 4%, or 20,000 metric tons, leaving an overall carbon footprint of 490,085 tons. 
Dell is neutralizing the entirety of that footprint by purchasing renewable energy and environmental credits. The bulk of those are composed of so-called renewable-energy certificates, or RECs, from wind-power projects in the U.S. 
Wind power typically costs more to produce than conventional coal- or natural-gas-fired electricity. To help defray that premium and spur wind power's growth, a market has sprung up in the U.S. in which wind-power developers can sell certificates to companies that want to offset their emissions. This works much like the broader market for "carbon credits," in which companies offset their emissions by buying credits that go toward a range of projects from renewable energy to forest preservation. 
The renewable-energy-certificate market in the U.S. has soared as corporate environmental claims have proliferated. One certificate typically represents one megawatt-hour of electricity from renewable sources such as wind turbines or solar panels. By that definition, the number of certificates bought voluntarily by companies in the U.S. rose to about 
10.6 million in 2007 from about 660,000 in 2003, according to the U.S. government's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Prices vary, but these certificates typically trade for a few dollars apiece. 
The carbon-credit market has also grown, especially in Europe, where governments limit emissions. It has softened somewhat since July, with the price of a permit dropping nearly 50%, to about $23 today. That's in part because of speculation that the economic downturn will prompt some European countries to loosen their environmental rules. 
For companies like Dell, credits are crucial to meeting their environmental promises. But even as the credit market grows, it's coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. A main concern is that some of the projects selling credits would have been built regardless. 
In such cases, the revenue from credits might help a renewable-energy company's financial performance, but it's not really funding new cuts in emissions. And that means the companies buying the credits to neutralize their own continued pollution aren't achieving the environmental gains they're claiming. 
Aware of this pitfall, Dell hired a consultant this summer to review some of its planned REC purchases and confirm their legitimacy. 
"They wanted to make sure that when they came out and said, 'Here's our carbon footprint,' there were no surprises," says Craig Ebert, U.S. director for ICF International, the Fairfax, Va.-based consultant Dell hired. 
Neither ICF nor Dell will release the report ICF prepared. Mr. Ebert says the three-page memo was a "basic assessment" of the projects. "It wasn't a deep dive down into every nook and cranny of the projects," he says, because that "really wasn't necessary, and we weren't asked to do that by Dell." He says the report concluded that the wind-power projects Dell asked ICF to vet wouldn't have been economically feasible without the revenue from the certificate sales. 
The companies involved in several of Dell's wind projects say otherwise. The smallest project -- one not reviewed by ICF -- is a single wind turbine at the University of Minnesota's West Central Research and Outreach Center in Morris, Minn. The turbine, installed in 2005, was entirely funded through a $2 million grant from a Minnesota state program designed to promote renewable energy, said Michael Reese, the research center's renewable-energy director. 
The university "absolutely" would have built the turbine even if it hadn't been able to sell certificates, Mr. Reese says. The approximately $15,000 in annual revenue the university gets from the certificate sales "adds up," he says, "but it's not a main component of the funding" for the project. 
The situation is similar with the Elk River Wind Project, in Beaumont, Kan., from which Dell has bought a larger number of certificates. They are sold through Empire District Electric Co., a power company based in Joplin, Mo., that buys Elk River's wind energy. Julie Maus, an Empire spokeswoman, says it's able to afford the wind power because the project gets tax credits from the federal government. 
The additional revenue Empire gets from selling RECs is "just sort of icing on the cake," she says. "We would have entered into the project regardless of whether we had the ability to sell these RECs or not." 
The single biggest contributor to Dell's carbon-neutral claim is a trio of wind projects in Iowa owned by Mid American Energy Co., a Des Moines-based power producer. 
Mid American "certainly" would have built the wind farms regardless of whether it had been able to sell RECs, says Tom Budler, the company's general manager of wind development. The wind farms are profitable as a result of the federal tax credit, he says, so the credit profits are "just additional value." 
Both Empire and Mid American say the REC revenue also helps keep down electricity rates for their customers. 
ICF, the consultant Dell hired to vet several of the wind projects, stands by its study, the company's Mr. Ebert says. Dell's Mr. Parker said in an email that the computer maker has "made a conscious decision to partner with the world's most reputable providers" of environmental credits. 
Representatives of other projects from which Dell is buying offsets say the company's money is critical. A project to protect a threatened forest in Madagascar, for example, wouldn't have happened without Dell's investment, says Toby Janson-Smith, an official at Conservation International, the environmental group coordinating that program. Dell is offsetting about 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually through the Madagascar project. 
The carbon-neutral pledges show no sign of abating. In about two years, the University of Minnesota's contract to sell RECs from its wind turbine will expire. But the turbine will continue producing certificates. At that point, the university plans to keep the certificates for itself, the school's Mr. Reese says. The reason: The university, too, plans to use the chits to claim that it's going carbon-neutral.

Abstract 
Nonetheless, wind is our fastest growing form of electrical generation, due entirely to federal and state subsidies and "renewable portfolios," in which the government tells utility companies what to build. 

Full Text 
There isn't much doubt that Congress and incoming President Barack Obama will try to impose some kind of limits on carbon emissions. The Republicans, girding in opposition, are denouncing global warming as a fraud, and claiming that either a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system will impose an unacceptable burden on the economy. 
Their strategy of stonewalling cedes the game in what will be the most dangerous aspect of carbon legislation -- the effort to use the proceeds of an emissions tax to subsidize a dead-end expedition into "renewable" energy. 
Whether global warming is real will probably not be known for another 50 years. There are signs, in the melting of the Arctic ice cap and warming in Alaska, that something unusual is happening to the climate. But skeptics note that world temperatures haven't risen since 1998 and that, if anything, recent weather has been unseasonably cold. Still, that doesn't mean we can dump billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year without eventual consequences. 
A $50 per ton carbon tax would raise gasoline prices about 25 cents per gallon -- nothing we haven't experienced in the last two years -- and accelerate a move toward electric hybrids, weaning us away from foreign oil. Nothing catastrophic there. The same levy would raise electric rates about 10%, which would encourage conservation while pushing us away from fossil fuels. 
The real danger is that, instead of refunding the tax to consumers, Congress will grab the money to subsidize the current craze for specific forms of energy, particularly wind or biofuels. 
Wind generation is the prime example of what can go wrong when the government decides to pick winners. The idea that it can replace significant quantities of coal or natural gas in electrical generation is a fantasy. 
Windmills generate power only 25% of the time and can change output minute-to-minute. A contemporary electric grid is a highly tuned instrument that cannot vary in voltage by more than a few percentage points without causing brownouts or damaging electric equipment. Under these circumstances, wind is more of a nuisance than a source of power. 
Nonetheless, wind is our fastest growing form of electrical generation, due entirely to federal and state subsidies and "renewable portfolios," in which the government tells utility companies what to build. In a few years we could find ourselves in the position of Denmark -- which has built thousands of windmills without closing a single fossil-fuel plant. 
Biofuels have already proven to be an even bigger disaster. They've gobbled up 30% of our corn crop and have leveled tropical forests, while replacing less than 3% of our oil. 
Solar energy, on the other hand, has distinct advantages that will emerge from limiting carbon emissions without any additional subsidies. Besides being carbon-free, solar electricity is at a maximum when it's needed most -- on hot summer afternoons. This is when the utilities need "peaking power," usually provided by expensive gas turbines. Rooftop solar collectors could provide ample peaking electricity, particularly in southern climates where air conditioning is a way of life. 
The real beneficiary of a carbon-emissions regimen, however, is likely to be nuclear power. Already anticipating this revival, the nuclear industry has submitted 18 proposals for 28 new reactors before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Granted, many of Mr. Obama's environmental allies seem ready to lie down in front of bulldozers before allowing a nuclear revival to take place. But the president-elect's position seems more nuanced. His home state of Illinois, after all, gets 45% of its electricity from nuclear reactors. 
A prudent position for Republicans should be: "Carbon limits, yes, subsidies, no." If a carbon tax or cap-and-trade auction is imposed, use the revenues to reduce other taxes so it won't cripple the economy. The thing to avoid is a wild, congressionally driven speculative boom in alternative energy. As Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller University, puts it: "Renewable energy could be the next subprime mortgage meltdown."

Abstract 
The company, which once funded a think tank that argued carbon-dioxide emissions were helpful to human life, today acknowledges that burning fossil fuels is a significant source of greenhouse-gas emissions and increases the risks of climate change -- although it remains unsure about the exact role of human activity in global warming. A new $1.1 billion natural-gas-processing plant in West Texas scheduled for start-up in 2010 will capture about 13.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year -- twice as much as the expanded La Barge facility -- according to SandRidge Energy Inc., which is developing the project with Occidental Petroleum Corp. None of the companies would disclose the price at which carbon dioxide is sold. 

Full text 
While Exxon Mobil Corp. has been among the most vocal skeptics of man-made causes of climate change, the company has spent the last two decades forging an expertise in one of the key technologies to combat the problem: capturing and storing carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Since the 1980s, an Exxon natural-gas processing plant in Wyoming has been doing just what many environmentalists say needs to happen on a global scale: capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground instead of venting it into the air. Indeed, Exxon's La Barge, Wyo., facility, for years has captured more carbon dioxide -- the most abundant greenhouse gas -- than any other facility in North America. 
Now Exxon, at the insistence of state officials, is spending $70 million to expand by 50% the plant's capacity to capture carbon dioxide, brought to the surface along with the natural gas. The plant separates the natural gas from impurities. And the Texas oil giant is spending another $100 million to test new technology to make it easier and less expensive to strip carbon dioxide out of the natural gas. 
Both investments could secure a place for Exxon in the emerging marketplace aimed at lowering emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. There is also a growing market for carbon dioxide itself, because it helps produce more fossil fuels. 
Carbon dioxide is a key tool in the growing work of rejuvenating worn-out oil fields. The gas is pumped into old reservoirs and helps the remaining oil flow out. 
Much of the carbon dioxide worrying environmental regulators comes from burning fossil fuels, which is why coal-fired power plants and automobiles are major emitters. But the global hunt for natural gas to heat homes and generate electricity also contributes. 
About one-third of the world's natural-gas reserves are mixed with high levels of carbon dioxide, according to Exxon Mobil. That means producing more natural gas will lead to even more carbon dioxide being vented into the air. In Exxon's natural-gas fields near La Barge, about 65% of the gaseous mixture from the wells is carbon dioxide. Natural gas is only 22%. 
Wyoming officials have urged Exxon for years to capture more carbon dioxide. "In a world that is very concerned about too much carbon dioxide, we are actually carbon dioxide short. We could use a lot more carbon dioxide right now," says Rob Hurless, energy adviser to Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal. 
Exxon's carbon-dioxide efforts have earned the company grudging respect from environmentalists. 
"Certainly, Exxon isn't usually thought of as being in the forefront of environmental progress," says A. Scott Anderson, a senior policy adviser with the Environmental Defense Fund, "but the fact is they are deeply involved in carbon capture and storage technology." 
Exxon has recently turned a corner in its views on global warming. The company, which once funded a think tank that argued carbon-dioxide emissions were helpful to human life, today acknowledges that burning fossil fuels is a significant source of greenhouse-gas emissions and increases the risks of climate change -- although it remains unsure about the exact role of human activity in global warming. 
Exxon currently captures about four million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide at La Barge, the equivalent of tailpipe emissions from 600,000 cars. The plant's expansion, scheduled to be completed in 2010, will increase that to six million tons a year. 
Exxon spokesman Len D'Eramo said the company's goal is "to safely and efficiently extract additional CO2 for sales as market conditions warrant. La Barge CO2 has been extensively utilized by producers in Colorado and Wyoming." 
Outside of the Rockies, oil producers in West Texas also are using carbon dioxide to boost recovery in the Permian Basin's aging fields. A new $1.1 billion natural-gas-processing plant in West Texas scheduled for start-up in 2010 will capture about 13.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year -- twice as much as the expanded La Barge facility -­according to SandRidge Energy Inc., which is developing the project with Occidental Petroleum Corp. 
None of the companies would disclose the price at which carbon dioxide is sold. 
More carbon dioxide for use in old oil fields could be a boon for oil production. A 2006 report to the U.S. Energy Department, by industry consultants Advanced Resources International, noted that with enough carbon dioxide 210 billion additional barrels could be recovered from worn-out U.S. oil fields -- enough oil to satisfy U.S. consumption for 29 years. 
As an added bonus, the same rock formations that trapped oil for thousands of years can be used to store the carbon dioxide. 
About half of the carbon dioxide that Exxon Mobil pulls from the ground at La Barge is captured and then sold. The other half is vented into the atmosphere, according to state records, one reason Wyoming officials insisted that the plant's capacity to capture carbon dioxide be expanded. After the expansion, about 75% of the carbon dioxide will be captured. 
The demand for carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery far outstrips current supply, says Michael Moore, executive director of the North American Carbon Capture and Storage Association. Future projects to capture carbon dioxide emitted by industrial facilities or power plants could increase the supply of gas to be injected into oil reservoirs. 
Plano, Texas-based oil company Denbury Resources Inc., is planning to build a large pipeline from Mississippi to Texas to transport carbon dioxide that it can inject into the historic Hastings oil field, which has been producing since 1935. The company would tap into a large natural source of carbon dioxide in Mississippi, and is negotiating with industrial plants along the pipeline route to acquire more captured gas. 
In addition to its continuing expansion, Exxon is building a pilot plant in La Barge to test a new way to separate carbon dioxide from natural gas, making it more economic to capture carbon dioxide for storage. 
The process, originally patented in 1985 by Exxon scientists, makes the separation simpler -- eliminating the need for expensive equipment -- and leaves the carbon dioxide as a liquid that can be easily injected underground. It is expected to be operational in late 2009. 
The Exxon natural-gas wells are about 40 miles from its La Barge processing plant. The mixture of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases is produced and gathered and sent to the plant, where the methane is separated from the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is then sent via pipeline hundreds of miles to injection sites in Wyoming and Colorado.

Abstract 
Technology to take the carbon dioxide out of the exhaust from a coal-fired power plant could take 10 to 15 years to develop on a commercial scale, and even then would be costly. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Backers of a big "clean coal" project scuttled by the Bush administration are banking on President-elect Barack Obama to revive their venture, setting up a fight with the anti-coal wing of Mr. Obama's base. 
The FutureGen Alliance, a coalition of utility companies and coal producers, is hoping to revive plans to build the first commercial-scale project to capture and store emissions from coal-burning power plants. In one sign of its confidence, the FutureGen Alliance, along with a development group for Coles County, Ill., last week bought a 400-acre site for $7 million. The coalition includes American Electric Power Co., Consol Energy Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp., which had originally agreed to contribute 26% of the cost, with the 
U.S. paying the rest. 
The Bush administration abruptly pulled out of the project, to be based in Mattoon, Ill., in early 2008 after the project's costs almost doubled, to $1.8 billion, threatening to expose taxpayers to even higher costs in the future. 
"There's been extensive reaching out to the Obama administration and I think we've gotten a strong reception," said Mike Mudd, chief executive of the FutureGen Alliance. "We think it would be an excellent fit for a stimulus package." 
A big supporter of putting the FutureGen Alliance project in Illinois is Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), an Obama ally who threatened to hold up the nomination of any new Bush appointees to the Department of Energy when the project was pulled. 
The FutureGen Alliance is touting the carbon-capture-and-storage project as something that would create jobs immediately, one of the criteria that Mr. Obama has established for determining what to fund in a stimulus package. 
Illinois estimates that the project could create 1,300 construction jobs and 150 permanent jobs. Over the four-year construction period, the project could create 1,225 other jobs in areas such as manufacturing, as parts are needed in order to begin construction. 
Coal is a divisive issue within the coalition that lifted Mr. Obama to the White House. Coal is cheap and abundant in the U.S., but scientists say coal is a major source of the greenhouse gases linked to climate change. Government forecasters say that mandatory cuts in greenhouse gases, which Mr. Obama endorses, would force a decrease in U.S. coal use. Technology to take the carbon dioxide out of the exhaust from a coal-fired power plant could take 10 to 15 years to develop on a commercial scale, and even then would be costly. 
Mr. Obama's choice for energy secretary, Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu, called coal "my worst nightmare" in a 2007 speech. Mr. Chu said carbon capture technology is "not a guarantee that we have a solution." He emphasizes conservation, along with a greater reliance on renewable energy.

Full Text 
BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders on Friday backed landmark proposals to cut the bloc's greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% in coming years, but gave substantial 
concessions to industry and to coal-burning countries in Eastern Europe. 
The tension over how much to pay to fight climate change reflects the strains the global downturn is putting on the EU's agenda, as Germany and the United Kingdom square off 
over the wisdom of running up debt to boost growth. 

Leaders from the EU's 27 nations approved on Friday a coordinated call for fiscal-stimulus packages of around 1.5% of the bloc's gross-domestic product, or about 200 billion 

euros ($267 billion). The language they used, however, was vague enough to permit countries to do more or less. 
Germany has proposed a stimulus package that would pump around 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) into the economy over the next year. Meanwhile the U.K. plans about GBP 20 
billion ($30 billion) in stimulus by 2010, including short-term tax cuts. 

"All this will do is raise Britain's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off," German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck said in an interview with Newsweek. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown dismissed the comments, saying they reflected internal German politics. 
Friday's EU agreement won't force Germany to expand its stimulus package. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she will discuss possible new stimulus measures in January. 
The steel industry and other business lobbies welcomed Friday's climate-change deal, while it drew criticism from environmental groups. "Millions of poor people have been left 
in danger because EU leaders bowed to business-lobby pressure," said Elise Ford, head of the Brussels office of the Oxfam charity. 

French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the agreement as historic. It would require the EU to cut emissions by at least 20% and raise use of renewable energy to 20% of the 

bloc's energy mix by 2020. The package must still be approved by the European Parliament. 
The European Commission had proposed that polluting power plants pay in auctions for permits to emit greenhouse gases. Under Friday's agreement, poorer EU countries that 
rely heavily on coal -- a description tailored to Poland and others in Central and Eastern Europe -- will be allowed to give a large number of permits to power plants for free. 

In a concession to industry backed by Germany, polluters that might otherwise relocate their plants to avoid EU rules would get some free emissions permits. In addition, polluters would be able to buy a large share of their permits from a United Nations system that operates in developing countries, freeing them from the expensive task of cutting gas output at their own plants. 
Polish consumers could face a doubling or more of their electricity bills, Mr. Sarkozy said, defending the compromises. "It's not a matter of environmental protection," he said. 
"It's simply not socially acceptable." 
On another contentious issue, EU leaders agreed to concessions that open the way for Ireland to hold a new referendum on an EU institutional reform. Known as the Lisbon 
treaty, it would hand Brussels more authority, strengthen the bloc's foreign policy tools and give it a permanent president. 

Irish voters rejected the treaty in June. The other 26 nations approved the treaty by parliamentary vote. 

Ireland got assurances it would keep a seat on the commission, the EU's executive arm. The bloc had planned to cut the number of commissioners -- now one per country -- by 
a third. The other leaders also agreed to write guarantees protecting Ireland's low corporate-tax rates and its restrictions on abortion. 
As long as the "detail work" is approved, Ireland will hold a referendum before the end of October 2009, Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said.

Abstract 
The Republican's views are increasingly at odds with those of the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama, whose energy and environment appointees favor using the power of the federal government to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, so called because they trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. 

Full Text 
AUSTIN, Texas -- Gov. Rick Perry said federal regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions would be "absolutely economically disastrous" for energy-rich Texas, one of the few parts of the country still adding jobs. 
The Republican's views are increasingly at odds with those of the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama, whose energy and environment appointees favor using the power of the federal government to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, so called because they trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. 
"If you put that type of regulation in place in America, it will stifle innovation and strangle the American economy," Gov. Perry said during an interview in his office, where his cowboy hat sits on a bust of George Washington. 
As he stakes out his role as a high-profile dissenter on carbon legislation, Gov. Perry is leading a state that is changing. His opposition to federal cap-and-trade legislation to limit emissions plays well with Texas' traditional business community and many large campaign contributors; Texas is far and away the top carbon-dioxide-emitting state and largest coal consumer. 
But the state also has a growing renewable-energy industry. Texas has almost twice as much electrical generating capacity from wind turbines as second-place state, California, and far more than others. 
Moreover, Texans and Texas businesses are inching toward embracing a greener energy future. Luminant, a unit of Energy Future Holdings Corp. and the state's largest electricity provider, favors a federal cap-and-trade system. 
Public sentiment also appears to be shifting. State Sen. Kip Averitt, a Republican from Waco who heads the Natural Resources Committee, recently told the Waco Tribune-Herald that in the past, being an environmental-minded politician in Texas meant "you were considered a communist and you couldn't get elected. Now, if you're not an environmentalist you're a goober, and you can't get elected." 
Defying that trend, Gov. Perry has taken an increasingly public role opposing federal action. He sent a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in November urging it not to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Carol Browner, tapped by Mr. Obama to become "energy czar," favors the opposite position. 
Gov. Perry said that if the federal government follows a California model of limiting carbon-dioxide emissions, the economic impact could cripple a state whose low-regulation business climate has been an engine of economic growth. "We're 250,000 net new jobs created in Texas [September to September]. America lost 500,000." 
Some statehouse observers see in Gov. Perry's opposition to Washington regulations a shrewd political calculation. He is positioning himself as an outside-the-Beltway voice as he prepares for an anticipated, bruising political challenge from U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. She is widely expected to run for the governor's mansion in 2010. Her spokesman declined to comment. 
Gov. Perry faces criticism that his leadership on carbon emissions is isolating Texas and could hurt the state's ability to continue to be a leader on energy issues. 
"Clean energy will likely be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century," said state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston. "Texas can either be a leader in developing alternative energies and reap the benefits, or we will be left behind." 
A recent white paper, partly funded by the Environmental Defense Fund, warned that Texas could miss out on new green-energy jobs. "A massive economic opportunity awaits Texas, but we have not yet embraced the global acceptance of the new energy economy," it warned. 
Gov. Perry points to the phenomenal growth of wind farms in West Texas as an example that the state is embracing new energy opportunities. Texas' wind industry was jump-started by a state decision in 1999 to mandate a percentage of state energy output from clean sources.

WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama and his energy team could face the most inauspicious climate in years for pushing ahead with their plans to remake U.S. energy strategy. 
Mr. Obama plans soon to introduce his energy and environment team, which will include Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner as White House energy adviser. 
The team's makeup shows that Mr. Obama plans to put a heavy emphasis on combating climate change and promoting technologies to wean the U.S. off imported oil. He is packaging such priorities as a way to boost employment and help the economy by pouring money into efficiency projects. 
But the next administration will face a range of obstacles on the energy front, from plummeting oil prices and a declining economy to potential rifts among Mr. Obama's own advisers. 
In a sign of one major internal difference, Mr. Chu has called for gradually ramping up gasoline taxes over 15 years to coax consumers into buying more-efficient cars and living in neighborhoods closer to work. 
"Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe," Mr. Chu, who directs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September. 
But Mr. Obama has dismissed the idea of boosting the federal gasoline tax, a move energy experts say could be the single most effective step to promote alternative energies and temper demand. Mr. Obama said Sunday that a heightened gas tax would be a "mistake" because it would put "additional burdens on American families right now." 
No U.S. president has made significant headway altering America's energy habits during a period of falling oil prices. After hitting an all-time peak this summer, U.S. gasoline prices have sunk to their lowest level in years. Experts predict prices will remain weak until the world economy begins to revive. 
Falling prices and scarce credit already are putting the lid on hundreds of alternative-energy projects across the country, from wind farms to biofuel refineries. Reviving those projects, even with significant government incentives, won't be easy. 
"There's no way we can create a better future without the price of [fossil-fuel-based] energy going up," said Jay Hakes, who headed the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton. "But it's tough for a politician to get up and say 'Your prices are going to have to go up.'" 
Few members of Congress support increasing the federal gasoline tax, and the last effort to impose a new energy tax -- under Mr. Clinton in 1993 -- fell apart in Congress. 
Mr. Chu, who couldn't be reached Thursday for comment, said in the September interview that the federal government should impose higher efficiency standards for buildings and electronics. He added that the biggest misconception about energy policy is that "if you went to an energy-efficient economy, you will kill the economy. That is just demonstrably not true." 
But there are differences among Mr. Obama's advisers over what constitutes sound energy policy. 
Ms. Browner has been a critic of proposals to loosen restrictions on oil and natural gas drilling in the outer continental shelf, arguing that such moves would do little to reduce 
U.S. dependence on foreign oil and risk damaging U.S. coastlines. Her views on that issue put her sharply to the left of Mr. Obama's nominee for national-security adviser, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Jones, who supports expanded offshore drilling. 
Ms. Browner's background and public comments also indicate she will push energy policy in ways that stir opposition from auto makers, coal-fired utilities and other industries. She has called publicly for letting the EPA reconsider whether greenhouse gases "endanger" health or welfare -- the legal trigger for regulating them under the Clean Air Act -­and for completing rules that would attempt to measure the greenhouse-gas emissions of renewable fuels like corn ethanol. Major business groups are already trying to persuade the EPA not to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, warning it will lead to a cascade of costly mandates covering bakeries, breweries, schools and many other relatively small emitters. 
The next administration also will have to wrestle with the government's unwieldy energy bureaucracy, which critics say has stymied effective policies. Mr. Chu is poised to take over an agency that, despite its name, has little power to set energy strategy, and whose budget for research and development has become increasingly balkanized. 
Most of the Energy Department's budget goes toward funding atomic-energy-defense activities, such as cleaning up nuclear and chemical waste at old weapons plants. The agency's budget for research in renewable, fossil and nuclear energy has fallen sharply over the years, and much of its R&D funding is tied up in projects earmarked by 
members of Congress for their home states, according to a report published in September by Securing America's Future Energy, a Washington nonprofit. 
"Contrary to what everyone thinks, there's very little the Department of Energy can do to affect the types of fuel the country uses or the amounts they use," said Paul Portney, former president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank.

Currents -- Energy: A Past President's Advice to Obama: Act With Haste --- Jimmy Carter Says New Administration Needs to Harness the Benefits of a Crisis Mentality to Tame Energy Policy

Abstract 
[...] falling energy prices and the credit crisis are laying waste to scores of alternative-energy projects, from huge wind farms in Texas to biodiesel plants in Mr. Carter's home state of Georgia. When he took office in 1977, Americans were still traumatized from the gas lines and soaring prices of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, in which Saudi Arabia and other countries stopped selling crude oil to the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel. 

Full Text 
Atlanta -- Almost three decades later, Jimmy Carter recalls vividly what it was like trying to get Americans to turn down their thermostats and kick the oil habit. 
"It was like gnawing on a rock," the former president says. 
Now President-elect Barack Obama is heading to Washington with a set of energy goals as ambitious as Mr. Carter's back in 1976. He promises to free the country from "the 

tyranny of foreign oil" and to save "our planet for our children." He's calling for a "spirit of service and sacrifice," and promoting hybrid cars and wind and solar power. 
But Mr. Obama must now champion his $150 billion energy plans in the face of a sinking economy and oil prices that have fallen 70% since their record mid-summer high. 

Forces like these have killed at least four similar presidential efforts in the past. Already, falling energy prices and the credit crisis are laying waste to scores of alternative-
energy projects, from huge wind farms in Texas to biodiesel plants in Mr. Carter's home state of Georgia. 
Mr. Carter offers Mr. Obama this advice: Try to inspire Americans to see the virtue in making energy sacrifices, a notoriously tough sell, especially in the face of falling prices. 

Get energy legislation to Congress quickly, during the presidential honeymoon. And stick with it. 
"I think he can prevail if he does it early and with a great deal of dedication and enthusiasm -- and with tenacity," Mr. Carter says in an interview. 
History isn't tilted in Mr. Obama's favor. Presidents all the way back to Richard Nixon -- whose "Project Independence" promised to make America independent from foreign oil 

by 1980 -- were thwarted by short attention spans, other urgent problems and gyrations in the energy market. President Ford set a similar target for 1985. 
Today, as in the Carter era, Americans remain by far the world's biggest per-capita consumers of oil. About 70% of it is imported, compared with just over a third in 1981. 
"It's a sad characteristic of our society that energy issues get no political attention until prices run up," says James Schlesinger, Mr. Carter's -- in fact, America's -- first energy 

secretary and a veteran of multiple energy crises. Then, as soon as prices fall, everything "goes back to normal." 

Plunging oil prices are now sending gasoline to its cheapest level in decades, when adjusted for inflation. But Mr. Obama insists he will stick to his guns, telling "60 Minutes" in 
an interview soon after the election that he intends to break the pattern that has the country moving perpetually "from shock to trance" as prices soar and then tumble. 
"That has to be broken," he said. "Now is the time to break it." 
His allies in Congress also insist that this time will be different. It's "now a top national-security and economic issue," says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who 

is chairman of the new select committee on energy independence and global warming. "I don't think there will be any return to the old days." 

Mr. Carter says he had a key advantage over Mr. Obama -- a national sense that something had to be done: "The energy crisis that I inherited was in many ways much more serious than it is now." When he took office in 1977, Americans were still traumatized from the gas lines and soaring prices of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, in which Saudi Arabia and other countries 
stopped selling crude oil to the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel. 
Then, Americans were hit with the second energy trauma of the decade, the 1979 Iranian revolution and ensuing regional violence, which sent oil prices to new highs. 
Perhaps no other president staked more of his credibility on trying to wean the U.S. off foreign oil. 
Just two weeks into his presidency, Mr. Carter gave his famous "fireside chat" on energy. Clad in a yellow cardigan that now hangs in his presidential museum, he called on 

Americans to save energy by lowering their thermostats to 65 degrees during the day. Two months later, he called the energy crisis "the moral equivalent of war." 

Later, in his most politically costly address dubbed by critics the "malaise speech," Mr. Carter announced a massive program to boost solar power and make synthetic fuel from coal. He vowed the U.S. would never again import more oil than it did in 1977. But in that 1979 speech, he also described a nation gripped by a "crisis of the American spirit." Mr. Carter's foes seized on the gloomy language and said the president was 
blaming Americans for his own travails. 
Mr. Carter concedes that his battles over energy policy cost him political support. "It sapped away a substantial portion of my domestic influence to harp on this unpleasant subject for four solid years," he says. 
And yet, energy activists say that the Carter administration laid the groundwork for many of today's efforts to slash consumption and to develop renewable fuels, from biodiesel to wind and solar. 
Mr. Carter created the Energy Department, pushed through the first efficiency standards for appliances, and installed 32 solar-energy panels on the White House roof -­predicting at the time that they would either blaze the way toward a new energy future, or become "a museum piece." As part of roof repairs, President Reagan later removed the solar panels, two of which are indeed ensconced in the Carter museum. 
The Carter administration poured $8.4 billion into energy research and development in 1979, twice as much, in inflation-adjusted dollars, as the $4.2 billion spent in 2007. The decades since the seventies weren't kind to these efforts. 
"We call the 1980s and 1990s the Valley of Death," says Randy Swisher, president of the Washington-based American Wind Energy Association. "Investments weren't made, technologies evolved slowly, and the government offered very little support." 
The wind and solar industries have picked up in recent years, thanks in part to a boost in government subsidies that began about a decade ago. Yet the overall share of all renewable energies, including hydropower, has actually shrunk since the Carter years. In 1981, when Mr. Carter left office, about 7% of all U.S. energy came from renewable sources. Last year, that number stood at 6.7%. 
The share of government and private investments in new energy technologies haven't kept pace with investment in other technologies. A recent study by the University of California at Berkeley found that 10% of all research-and-development money went into energy projects in 1980, compared with about 2% today. 
The efficiency of the U.S. auto fleet hasn't fared much better. The combined car and light-truck fleet in 1981 had a fuel-efficiency rate of around 20.5 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Today, it clocks in at 20.8 miles per gallon, an improvement of just 1.5% in 27 years. 
To hear Mr. Carter tell it, what the country needed over all those years to spur it to action -- and what it still needs -- is a sustained sense of crisis. "Had it been sustained and continued, I don't have any doubt that Reagan and Bush and Clinton and others would have done the same thing," he says. 
At 84 years old, Mr. Carter hasn't lost his fascination for the subject that helped to define his presidency. Eight years ago, he planted 10 acres of paulownia trees on several fields around his house. Native to China, the trees are among the fastest growing in the world. His groves already stand more than 50 feet tall. He sent one of the trees this summer to a lab at the University of Georgia, where it was pulped and turned into ethanol. 
"These trees could become a great future source for biofuels," Mr. Carter says. "And these trees grow very well as far north as Virginia."

PARIS -- The European Union's ambitious plan to combat climate change could be dealt a crippling blow next week because of opposition from member nations who say the package is too onerous for businesses at a time of economic adversity. 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is scheduled to travel to Warsaw on Saturday in a last-ditch effort to win support from Poland and other Eastern European nations for the plan, in which the bloc agreed early last year to cut greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020. 
Italy has also opposed the plan, and Germany, which originally championed the measures, is now pushing to soften their impact on energy-intensive industries such as steel, cement and chemicals, as the economic downturn damps countries' commitments to fight global warming. 
"Some people claim environmental measures are a way to relaunch industry, but let's be realistic," said Stefania Prestigiacomo, Italy's environment minister. "Resources are limited, and they will be even more so because of the economic crisis." 
Backpedaling by Europe on its climate-change measures could spoil its effort to play a leading role in the wider international global-warming debate. In a separate meeting under way in Poznan, Poland, representatives from 190 countries, under the auspices of the United Nations, are meeting through Dec. 12 to work toward a separate treaty that would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The international accord would commit industrialized countries to deep emissions cuts in coming decades. 
Europe had hoped to help convince developing countries like China and India to sign on to the cuts, but could find its powers of persuasion diluted if member states are seen to be squabbling over their own green reforms. 
France has been a champion of the EU package and Mr. Sarkozy has made hammering out a deal a priority of his six-month presidency of the EU, which ends this month. If other countries' concerns can't be assuaged, the measures are likely to be shelved until the middle of 2009. The package needs to unanimous approval. 
The EU already watered down one important part of its package last week, agreeing to delay implementation of mandatory emissions caps for passenger cars to 2015 from 2012. Auto makers had lobbied hard to soften the emissions standards, arguing that they needed more time to adapt their vehicles. 
The conflict among EU countries centers on the details of implementation, which could have huge consequences for companies and employment levels. 
Poland, which gets more than 90% of its electricity from high-emission, coal-burning power plants, argues the rules will cause huge increases in electricity prices and potentially cripple its economy. Its main gripe with the package is a so-called auctioning provision, which would require power companies to pay for permits to pollute instead of being given most of them. 
According to the way the climate-change deal is currently written, companies that generate electricity would have to buy all of their carbon permits at auction starting in 2013. This would weigh on their bottom lines and inevitably lead to higher electricity prices as the firms pass on these extra costs to consumers. 
According to French diplomats, Mr. Sarkozy this week offered to delay auctions in the power sector until 2016 and then phasing them in gradually. The Poles said no, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. This weekend, Mr. Sarkozy will make the proposal again to Poland and countries including Bulgaria, Romania, and the Czech Republic. 
Italy is also threatening a veto. Ms. Prestigiacomo, the environment minister, said Italy's main concerns are the package's potential costs for the country's power sector and heavy industry. "We have to set priorities. It's useless to lay down objectives that won't be respected," she said. 
"It would be a miracle if we got an agreement at this point," a French diplomat said.

Abstract 
Unrealistically, Mr. Hansen also favors a complete phase-out of coal-fired electric power, arguing that it be replaced by advanced nuclear, which could be capable of recycling radioactive waste within a decade. 

Full Text 
Liberal interest groups, think tanks, lobbyists, bloggers and other nuisances are inundating the incoming Obama Administration with advice, but James Hansen recently managed to say something interesting. Namely, the famous NASA scientist had the nerve to expose some of the global-warming fantasies widespread among children and politicians. 
No, the spiritual leader of the climate-change movement hasn't recanted. Global warming threatens "not simply the Earth, but the fate of all its species, including humanity," he writes in his manifesto, which is tame by Mr. Hansen's normal rhetorical standards. (He likes to compare carbon to the Holocaust: "those coal trains will be death trains -- no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria.") 
But Mr. Hansen also had the honesty to follow his convictions to their logical conclusion, while reproaching his followers -- President-elect Obama among them -- for not doing the same. To wit, Mr. Hansen endorses a straight carbon tax as the only "honest, clear and effective" way to reduce emissions, with the revenues rebated in their entirety to consumers on a per-capita basis. "Not one dime should go to Washington for politicians to pick winners," he writes. 
The risks of fossil fuels remain speculative, but if they really are the apocalypse of Mr. Hansen's prophecies, then the cleanest remedy is a tax. That would raise energy and all other prices as the incentive for new technologies and investments. But a tax would be neutral, eliminating the market distortions caused by subsidies and regulation, and the proceeds could be used to offset other taxes. The transition to a world in which growth is not tied to carbon would still be long and extremely expensive, but a tax would be the least painful way to get there. 
"A tax should be called a tax," Mr. Hansen writes. "The public can understand this and will accept a tax if it is clearly explained and if 100 percent of the money is returned." Clearly the man is not standing for elective office. 
Beltway sachems prefer posturing that disguises the cost of rising energy prices, such as cap and trade. This "subterfuge," as Mr. Hansen terms it, shifts the direct burden onto businesses, which then pass it along to consumers. Congress may flatter itself that it is saving mankind, but what the Members really want is a cap-and-trade windfall that they can redistribute in the green pork of Mr. Obama's "new energy economy," whatever that means. 
Unrealistically, Mr. Hansen also favors a complete phase-out of coal-fired electric power, arguing that it be replaced by advanced nuclear, which could be capable of recycling radioactive waste within a decade. He adds: "It is essential that hardened 'environmentalists' not be allowed to delay the R&D on 4th generation nuclear power." We'd like to see him debate Al Gore on that one. 
Mr. Hansen can usually find a journalistic stenographer for his pronouncements. This one evaporated without a trace. Perhaps it's because the Obama transition is drowning in position papers. Or perhaps his candor is merely too embarrassing.

Two down, one to go. 
You might think now that Barack Obama has staffed his economic and security teams, the hard choices are over. But he has one more doozy of a decision to make. And the worry is that his picks for that final, crucial team -- those overseeing energy and environmental policy -- will undo any smart moves the president-elect has made so far. 
It isn't yet clear Team Obama understands that it doesn't have the luxury of making a mistake here. Energy is the engine of, and inextricably linked to, the American economy. Environmental policies and regulations that punish energy markets will only deliver a further economic hit. 
In the process, this will damage Mr. Obama's own goals. He has picked an economic team that has already successfully discouraged him from proceeding immediately with any tax hikes. Good. But an ill-crafted cap-and-trade program that dramatically escalates energy costs is the same as a giant tax hike. Mr. Obama is promising to save or create 2.5 million jobs. Fabulous. But drowning industries in exorbitant energy prices will only encourage further overseas flight. If the president-elect thinks Detroit is a problem, just wait for the impact an upward march in electricity prices would have on, say, the manufacturing South. 
Most of Mr. Obama's decisions so far have reflected the fact that the economy he is taking over is far different from the one he campaigned on. (No one would have thought eight months ago of a Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, but $700 billion financial rescues have ways of changing things.) Yet so far, all signs suggest the Obama crew is stubbornly refusing to acknowledge this reality when it comes to its militant past promises on energy and environment. 
The transition itself is being handled by John Podesta. After leaving the Clinton White House, he founded the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, where he became deeply immersed in environmental issues. His recent book, "The Power of Progress," ruminates on how one duty of "progressives" is to save the world from climate change. At his side in the transition is former Clinton Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) head Carol Browner, who is as committed a green revolutionary as they come. 
Having enraged the left wing of his party with several initial high-profile appointments, Mr. Obama is now under pressure to placate this mob. One obvious, if frightening, choice would be to reward them with the energy-and-environment portfolio, turning it over to a team that shares the grass-roots' green agenda. 
The appointments at stake here are big, with the potential for even greater influence. There's chief of the EPA, the prominence of which is growing in the climate debate. Another is secretary of the Energy Department, a body that traditionally serves as a cheerleader for the entire mix of domestic energy sources (including nuclear, oil and coal), but which, with a weak or turncoat head, could easily fail in that duty. 
Mr. Podesta is also a fan of creating a National Energy Council (akin to the National Economic Council). This council would presumably include a much-discussed "climate czar," with a straight line to the president. 
Sanity is all the more in need given the Washington environment. Henry Waxman's ouster of the thoughtful John Dingell as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee proves the left is raring to sweep through a climate agenda, with little or no debate about the economic consequences. Mr. Obama needs a team that will push back, and think through the ramifications for his broader agenda. 
And then there's the regulatory temptation. Last year the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are "air pollutants." This opened the door for vast new EPA powers that could, in the wrong hands, make that agency a central planner for the entire economy. Environmentalists love that idea. Voters may not. 
The EPA will also have purview over whether to grant California's request for tougher auto standards -- a move that might well finish off Detroit, even as Mr. Obama attempts to save it. Better to have a team that is aware of the political and practical implications of an EPA power grab. 
This last point is downright terrifying considering that Mrs. Browner is not only helping with the transition, but is a rumored pick for a second run at EPA. Mrs. Browner's worldview is that the only way to accomplish environmental good is to use blunt regulatory and legal force to squeeze targeted industries. Her last ride at that agency was marked by a series of diktats and lawsuits that dog companies to this day. 
Mrs. Browner encapsulates, in fact, the choice Mr. Obama has to make. A team of Browner-ites, armed with even greater regulatory powers, would certainly bring change. But the cost would be huge, both to Mr. Obama's political accountability and to the economy he has promised to restore. 
This is the new reality. The president-elect can't have it both ways.

Full Text 
If President Barack Obama wants to stop the descent toward dangerous global climate change, and avoid the trade anarchy that current approaches to this problem will invite, he should take Al Gore's proposal for a carbon tax and make it global. A tax on CO2 emissions -- not a cap-and-trade system -- offers the best prospect of meaningfully engaging China and the U.S., while avoiding the prospect of unhinged environmental protectionism. 
China emphatically opposes a hard emissions cap on its economy. Yet China must be part of any climate deal or within 25 years, notes Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, its emissions of CO2 could amount to twice the combined emissions of the world's richest nations, including the United States, Japan and members of the European Union. 
According to the world authority on the subject, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will cost $1.375 trillion per year to beat back climate change and keep global temperature increases to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 
Cap-and-traders assume, without much justification, that one country can put a price on carbon emissions while another doesn't without affecting trade or investment decisions. This is a bad assumption, given false comfort by the Montreal Protocol treaty, which took this approach to successfully rein in ozone-depleting gases. Chlorofluorocarbons are not pervasive like greenhouse gases (GHGs); nor was the economy of 1987 hyperglobalized like ours today. 
Good intentions to limit big polluters in some countries but not others will turn any meaningful cap into Swiss cheese. It can be avoided by relocating existing and new production of various kinds of CO2-emitting industries to jurisdictions with no or virtually no limits. This is known as carbon leakage, and it leads to trade anarchy. 
How? The most advanced piece of climate legislation at the moment, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, contains provisions for retaliatory action to be taken against imports from carbon free-riding nations. Married with the current economic malaise, the temptation to slide into a righteous but runaway environmental protectionism -- which Washington's K Street lobbyists would be only too happy to grease -- would almost certainly lead to a collapse of the multilateral trading system. This scenario was presented to the world's trade ministers last December at the United Nations climate talks in Bali by David Runnalls of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. 
True, trade anarchy might reduce emissions via a massive global depression. But there would be a lot of collateral damage. Because of the sheer scale of the challenge and the state of the hyperglobalized economy, we will need the same price on carbon everywhere, or it won't work anywhere. 
President Obama can define his legacy in the first 100 days by laying the groundwork for a global tax on carbon dioxide emissions that is effective, efficient, equitable and enforceable. An effective, harmonized tax on C02 emissions must stabilize the growth of atmospheric concentrations of GHGs by no later than 2020. The tax must also be adjusted annually, by a global body, according to this objective. 
The IPCC has crunched the numbers and says this means a tax of about $50 levied on every metric ton of GHGs, or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e to use their terminology). In the short-term, consumers would feel the pinch. But the tax would pave the way for cheaper, cleaner energy and ways of getting around. 
The most efficient way to apply a carbon tax is at a relatively small number of major carbon bottlenecks, which cover the lion's share of GHGs. The key points where flows of carbon are the most concentrated include: trunk pipelines for gas, refineries for oil, railroad heads for coal, liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals, cement, steel, aluminum and GHG-intensive chemical plants. 
Collecting and spending the bulk of revenues from a carbon tax must remain the sovereign right of participating nations. For instance, nations could decide to make the tax revenue-neutral by reducing taxes on income or helping finance industrial retooling for a green economy. 
However, we in the rich world must recognize our culpability for creating three-quarters of this global warming mess, as well as our greater capacity to finance industrial retooling. Thus, there could be a carrot for developing-world nations which commit to applying the phased-in carbon tax: Access to a portion of the carbon tax levies from rich countries to help preserve forests and to prepare for climate change through flood walls, improved irrigation, drought resistant crops, desalination facilities, and the like. This is no small change: 10% of $50/metric ton CO2e carbon tax levied in all rich countries would be $100 billion per year. The stick for carbon free-riding countries would come in the form of incrementally severe penalties, leading up to countervailing duties on carbon-intensive imports. 
A global carbon tax levied on a relatively small number of large sources can be monitored by satellite and checked against the annual surveillance of fiscal and economic polices already carried out by IMF staff. Thus, the accounting involved is much more precise and much less subject to the vagaries of corruption and conflict over which industries and companies get their free handouts of carbon credits -- carbon pork -- than in a cap-and-trade system. 
There are three reasons why countries, such as China and India, that have traditionally resisted any notion of a common responsibility to make current polluters pay would do well to enlist in this effort. 
First, while there is no limit on the downside for missing a hard cap, with a carbon tax you just pay as you go. If a fast-growing country like China accepted an emissions cap and then overshot it, they would have to purchase carbon credits on the international market. If they missed their target by a lot, carbon credits would be scarce, and purchasing them would suck dry their foreign exchange reserves in one slurp. That's why a carbon tax is much easier to swallow and, anyway, through the power of the price signal, it would produce the same desired result as a hard cap. 
Second, administering billions of dollars of carbon credits in a cap-and-trade system in an already chaotic regulatory environment would invite a civil war between interest groups seeking billions in carbon credit handouts and the regulator holding the kitty. By contrast, a uniform tax on CO2 emissions levied at a small number of large sites would be relatively clear-cut. During the Montreal Protocol talks in the 1980s, India smartly balked at a suggestion to phase out CFCs in certain products and not in others because of the chaos that would result from the ambiguity. 
Third, key people in China read our newspapers. They see the ominous clouds of protectionism under the guise of environmentalism in bills like Lieberman-Warner and they don't want to be harmed; neither should we, given the trillions of dollars of Treasury bills they hold. Showing compliance with a harmonized carbon tax at a small number of large bottleneck points would be child's play compared to the chaos of cap-and-trade. 
If President Obama hits the ground running fast in the direction of a global carbon tax, he can usher in a new dawn that might finally make peace between man and climate.

Abstract 
In the U.S., the same basic battle soon will heat up as President-elect Barack Obama, who has pledged to push for deep cuts in U.S. emissions of global-warming gases, moves into the White House. Even if cars running on ethanol emit lower levels of greenhouse gases than do cars running on gasoline, very few cars run on ethanol, which makes for a negligible environmental benefit.

"Think globally, act locally," urged an environmental mantra popular in the 1970s. That strategy made sense when communities faced visible problems such as polluted streams and smoggy air. It is less effective today, as the world tries to tackle a threat as broad and shapeless as climate change. 
For all the talk about a unified response to global warming, what is emerging is a crazy quilt of often-competing local strategies. Different industries, regions and countries are trying to shape policy to stick others with the bulk of the cleanup costs. And when they do act, they are focusing on the part of the problem that is most apparent to them. That's human nature, and it is getting in the way of bailing out Mother Nature on an unprecedented, global scale. 
This messiness is about to spill into public view on two levels. Globally, diplomats are convening over the next two weeks in Poland for a climate-change conference, where the official purpose is to protect the planet and the subtext is to shift the cost to someone else. In the U.S., the same basic battle soon will heat up as President-elect Barack Obama, who has pledged to push for deep cuts in U.S. emissions of global-warming gases, moves into the White House. 
Local interests are clashing with global interests in many places. In California, proposals for large solar-energy projects in the desert are running into opposition from area residents who don't want to have to look at all those mirrors. In Washington, calls for a minimum national energy-efficiency standard for buildings -- which research suggests may be one of the cheapest ways to curb the growth in fossil-fuel consumption -- are unpopular with the construction industry. In China, there is increasing support for curbing pollution, as long as the effort doesn't crimp the country's freedom to keep building power plants that run on cheap coal. 
Even when cities or countries try to make broad environmental progress, they often aren't doing the things that would deliver the biggest impact. 
One example is ethanol, a corn-based fuel long pushed by Midwestern farmers and by Washington as a way to reduce U.S. oil dependence. Even if cars running on ethanol emit lower levels of greenhouse gases than do cars running on gasoline, very few cars run on ethanol, which makes for a negligible environmental benefit. 
Another example is the market for "carbon credits." These chits are bought by companies, mainly in Europe and Japan, that face government requirements to curb their environmental impact. The credits are said to fund pollution-cutting projects in developing countries, supposedly helping the planet at lower cost than if the work were done in the developed world. But several studies suggest that companies in industrialized countries may be paying for pollution cuts that would have happened even without their cash, which would mean some of their money is going to waste. 
After a decade of small and fitful experiments with curbing emissions in isolated industries and regions, it is now clear that a massive economic transformation would be necessary to achieve the scale of emissions cuts that many scientists and politicians are suggesting. Under a 1997 international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol, most industrialized countries pledged to trim their greenhouse-gas emissions by a collective 5% below 1990 levels by 2012. Now, some of those countries seem likely to miss their targets. Even if they met them, it wouldn't make enough difference to the planet. The world's two biggest polluters -- the U.S. and China -- aren't constrained by the Kyoto agreement. The U.S. declined to ratify the accord, and China, as a developing country, isn't required by Kyoto to make any pollution cuts. 
Today, the European Union is considering setting a more-ambitious goal: a 20% emissions cut below 1990 levels by 2020. But several coal-dependent European countries say they think those goals would cost too much. Among them: Poland, the site of the conference this week and next that's supposed to pursue bold international environmental action. 
One lesson from all this is that regulatory sticks aren't likely to be enough. Financial carrots also will be important to try to convince polluters, whether companies or countries, that cleaning up their act is in their economic interest. Here again, however, those interests are being defined in narrowly local terms. 
In the U.S., proponents of more-aggressive action to curb climate change say the push could create new economic opportunities. That is the argument made by Mr. Obama, who has endorsed the goal of slashing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. He says a multibillion-dollar federal investment in environmentally friendly technology, from wind turbines to energy-efficient buildings, could create millions of "green jobs." 
The big question is whether that money gets spent in a way that maximizes its environmental impact. Developing countries, where emissions are rising fastest, argue that the West should fork over more money to help them adopt cleaner energy technology. But amid today's economic downturn, there is less wealth to spread around. 
Speaking to reporters recently, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), who plans to attend the global-warming conference in Poland, said the U.S. is "not going to be in the position we were two years ago, in the short term, to do as much technology transfer or other economic assistance" to countries such as China. That, he added, "shouldn't change the willingness of some other cash-flush countries" to help pony up.

Abstract 
Under the system, EU governments give companies permits to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide, the main gas believed to cause global warming. 

Full text 
One of the latest business ventures at electricity supplier RWE AG is giving away light bulbs in the developing world. The German company has teamed up with an Indian utility to hand out 700,000 energy-efficient bulbs in India's eastern port city of Vishnakhapatnam. 
RWE's motive for such ecocharity: It helps reduce the cost of complying with Europe's increasingly stringent limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. But even with such projects, RWE faces higher pollution-compliance costs in the coming years as emissions rules get more strict. That will likely eat into profit and lead to higher power prices for consumers and businesses. 
RWE's predicament provides important lessons for the U.S. as it contemplates setting up its own system to fight climate change. Europe's greenhouse-gas "cap and trade" system has been up and running since 2005. After a rocky start, the true impact -- and costs -- are starting to be felt by regulated companies. Policy makers in the U.S. may soon have to make their own tough decisions about what sectors should shoulder the burden of reducing pollution. 
President-elect Barack Obama said in a speech last week that he would move quickly to create a federal system to cap greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Senate Democrats say they plan to introduce legislation in January directing the Environmental Protection Agency to set up a cap-and-trade system. 
RWE spent more than 1 billion euros, or roughly $1.25 billion, on greenhouse-gas compliance in the first nine months of this year -- equivalent to nearly half its 2.2 billion euros in net income for the period. The cost was just 175 million euros for the first nine months of last year. Since most of RWE's power stations burn brown coal, which is plentiful in Germany but releases high levels of greenhouse gas, its burden under Europe's regulations is particularly heavy. 
"Climate change is a global challenge, and we support Europe's efforts to cap emissions," says Henning Rentz, RWE's head of policy affairs. He worries, however, that future regulations will weigh disproportionately on his industry. "The new rules should not discriminate against utilities that burn coal, and they need to ensure that we can stay competitive." 
The European Union first set caps on greenhouse-gas emissions in 2005 for big polluting industries, such as utilities and steel and cement makers. Under the system, EU governments give companies permits to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide, the main gas believed to cause global warming. 
If a company emits more than its cap, it must cover the excess by obtaining more permits. One way is by trading on the "carbon market," that is, buying permits from companies with permits to spare. Permits also can be earned through carbon-reduction projects in developing countries, such as RWE's light-bulb giveaway in India. 
In the early years of this cap-and-trade system, most European industries were given more permits than they needed, and emissions crept up about 1% a year. European regulators responded by sharply lowering the emissions caps this year. Regulators sought to soften the blow for companies facing competition from outside the EU, as in the steel and cement industries. That was offset by placing stricter limits on utilities, which often are quasimonopolies not subject to price competition and who can pass on added costs to consumers. 
German utilities, including RWE and E.ON AG, will be short a total of roughly 79 million permits this year, according to Point Carbon, a market-research firm based on Oslo, Norway. At the current permit price, which is well off this year's peak, that comes to $1.42 billion to purchase permits. Italy's utilities, including Enel SpA, will be short 51 million permits, while U.K. utilities, such as British Energy Group PLC, will be short 70.5 million in total. 
It's difficult to forecast the cost for purchasing permits since their price changes constantly on Europe's carbon market. The price for a 2008 permit peaked in June at 28 euros but has since fallen to around 18 euros amid Europe's economic downturn. Point Carbon projects an average price of 29 euros for a carbon permit for the next three years. 
The rules have already hit the bottom line at some utilities. Britain's Drax Group PLC, which operates Western Europe's largest coal-fired power plant, says its profit was cut by nearly 50% in the first half from a year earlier. The company says it spent GBP 107 million ($162 million) on carbon permits in the half, up from GBP 11 million a year earlier. 
Italy's Enel, meanwhile, is "quite confident that we can cover the whole shortfall through imported credits," says Eliano Russo, Enel's head of carbon strategy. Enel has about 70 projects under way in China, including for wind and hydro power and by helping to make steel smelters more energy efficient.

WASHINGTON -- Rep. Henry Waxman will become chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, ousting the more business-friendly Rep. John Dingell in a contest that highlighted the determination of House Democrats to enact a sweeping, activist agenda. 
Mr. Waxman's victory ensures that the committee will move in a more liberal direction, especially on energy and climate change. The California Democrat's ascent caused immediate consternation in the already-reeling automobile and coal industries. 
Mr. Dingell, a 53-year House veteran who represents a district in the working-class suburbs of Detroit, has been a staunch defender of the auto makers. He has stood in the way of proposals to more rapidly boost federal gasoline-mileage standards and advocated less aggressive proposals to curb so-called greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, than other Democratic Party leaders. 
Mr. Waxman is widely expected to make passage of climate change legislation a top priority next year. Last month, he joined more than 150 other House Democrats in outlining "principles" for such legislation, including emissions reductions of at least 15% by 2020. 
"We have an opportunity that maybe comes only once in a generation," Mr. Waxman said, following a 137-122 vote of House Democrats that was not as close as many expected. "I think that the Democratic caucus agreed with me that we must meet that challenge and move forward." 
The current financial crisis, Mr. Waxman suggested, could pave the way for ambitious regulatory action, much as the Great Depression did. "We may well turn out to be as historical as the Congress was in 1933," he said. "What I don't want to see happen is the Congress end up the way we were in 1994, without success." 
The Energy and Commerce Committee oversees such critical areas as health care and telecommunications, but pending legislation on energy and climate change was clearly foremost on the Democrats' mind. 
Mr. Waxman is widely expected to make passage of climate change legislation a top priority next year. Last month, he joined more than 150 other House Democrats in outlining "principles" for such legislation, including emissions reductions of at least 15% by 2020. 
Mr. Dingell had worked closely with auto makers, utilities and business groups to draft legislation that would allow more time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than proposals by other Democrats. Mr. Waxman's victory cheered environmentalists, but left business representatives glum about the prospect of more demanding and costly climate change legislation. 
"It's going to be a different world," said William Kovacs, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "The way [Mr. Dingell] approached the subject was to include everyone in the thinking process and come up with a working document. I think Mr. Waxman will move much quicker than Mr. Dingell would." 
Mr. Waxman's victory was striking because it is unusual for Congress to set aside traditions of seniority. Mr. Dingell will become the longest-serving member in the history of the House of Representatives next February. 
The vote reflected the broader divisions within the Democratic caucus. By all accounts, the session was intense and the speeches impassioned. Many Midwestern lawmakers, whose core constituencies are blue-collar and union workers, lined up behind Mr. Dingell. Coastal representatives, whose districts are more focused on information, technology or service jobs, backed Mr. Waxman. 
There also was a cultural dimension to the battle between the gruff Michigan veteran and the dapper gentleman from Beverly Hills. 
"Right at the moment I'm weeping for the heartland," Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said after the vote. "It's Hollywood versus Detroit -- I mean, think about it." 
With Mr. Waxman's ascent, more leadership changes on the Energy and Commerce Committee are possible. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.) is expected to replace Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.,) as chairman of the subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, which has jurisdiction over legislation involving virtually every form of energy. 
Mr. Markey has pushed legislation that would effectively halt the permitting of any new coal-fired power plants that lack the technology to capture and permanently sequester the plant's carbon dioxide emissions. Such technology is believed to be decades from widespread commercial deployment.

Full Text 
John Dingell's fall from power yesterday is an important inflection point in the history of the modern Democratic Party. The House purge marks the final triumph of the Congressional generation that came of political age during the 1970s over the last lion of New Deal liberalism, and it is symbolic of the party's change in culture and policy priorities in the Barack Obama era. 
Sitting chairmen are nearly impossible to depose, never mind one with the seniority and record of Mr. Dingell, who has served longer than anyone else in the House. The Democratic caucus nonetheless stripped him of his 28-year position atop the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has great power over the climate change and health-care bills that Mr. Obama hopes to pass next year. Instead, California's Henry Waxman, who was elected by a reported 137 to 122, will do the honors. (We say "reported" because the vote was by secret ballot, which in a rich irony Democrats want to prevent for union organizing votes.) 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed to be neutral, though it was clear all along that she was twisting arms on Mr. Waxman's behalf. "I assume that not playing a role is playing a role," as Charlie Rangel, another venerable committee chairman, put it yesterday. Ms. Pelosi loathes Mr. Dingell's independence -- especially on environmental matters. 
That fissure neatly separates the Waxman Democrats from the old vanguard that Mr. Dingell represents. He was first elected in 1955 and has always tried to protect his hometown Detroit auto makers from the eco-mandates that ultimately helped to land them in their present predicament. Mr. Dingell's rough-hewn candor about the realities of "doing something" about climate change also helped to make him a green pariah. He knows that carbon regulation and taxes will fall most heavily on domestic manufacturing and Midwest states that rely on coal-fired power. His sympathies lie with the people who work near (or in) factories and drive Fords or Chevys. 
Mr. Waxman, speaking for the upscale precincts of Beverly Hills, wants to phase out coal and cars that use gasoline. The coastal elites who now dominate Democratic politics will happily trade the blue collar for the green collar. 
Like George Miller, Barney Frank and the other liberals produced by Vietnam and Watergate, Mr. Waxman belongs to a cohort whose power has been checked -- one way or the other -- by Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton's New Democrat tendencies, the Republican sweep of 1994 and George W. Bush. Now with a new Democratic President and a crisis to use as a lever for a sweeping expansion of government, they aren't about to let an old warhorse with scruples about the costs of regulation interfere with their moment to govern. 
We should add that Mr. Dingell is hardly some business apologist. At Energy and Commerce in the 1980s and early 1990s, Mr. Dingell would burn the paint off the committee room walls with his interrogations of energy, insurance and drug company executives. The irony is that Democrats have found, in Mr. Waxman, an even more extreme antibusiness tribune, who will no doubt use his new powers to go after any concern that turns a profit but refuses to pay his party the obeisance of campaign cash and regulatory submission. In short, the Democrats have ousted the dean of the House for the spleen of the House. 
Meanwhile, in another sign of the Waxman ascendancy, President-elect Obama has named Philip Schiliro, a Waxman loyalist and his former chief of staff, as the new White House director of Congressional relations. Robert Sussman, who leads the transition's Environmental Protection Agency "review team," has been an astringent critic of Mr. Dingell on carbon regulation. And Carol Browner, Al Gore's protege turned Clinton EPA administrator turned director of Mr. Obama's "energy working group," is another old Dingell foe. 
It's obvious who now pulls the Democratic levers of power, and anyone in the energy or health-care business had better erect the barricades. In the small favors department, Mr. Waxman will allow Mr. Dingell to hold the title "chairman emeritus."

Duke Energy Corp. cut a rooftop solar project in North Carolina by half, to 400 roofs from 800 roofs. In addition, Duke said it had removed $400 million from its 2009 budget that it had planned to spend on wind power. A Marketplace article on Thursday incorrectly said that the solar program was being cut to 4,000 roofs from 8,000 and that the company had canceled a $400 million wind project it had planned to build with a partner. 
(WSJ November 22, 2008) 
President-elect Barack Obama has vowed to promote clean and renewable energy, reiterating this week that his "presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change." 
But the nation's power companies suddenly are struggling to turn that promise into reality. 
"Funding has stalled," says Ezra Green, chief executive of Clear Skies Solar Inc. The New York company recently canceled plans to build a one-megawatt solar plant in California's Mojave Desert, unable to get financing even though a California utility agreed to buy all the output. 
"We've canceled the solar-panel order," Mr. Green says. 
Hobbled by the financial crisis, power companies across the U.S. are slashing capital budgets and canceling projects for clean electricity. Financing for new nuclear power plants appears shaky. And some energy companies are even having trouble satisfying their short-term needs for cash. 
Forging a new energy future by creating vast amounts of wind, solar and, possibly, nuclear energy is one of Mr. Obama's highest priorities. But enacting that policy depends to a large degree on the ability of energy companies and utilities to finance the massive new investments that would be needed. With many of those companies cutting spending, a lot of those investments are being pared back or eliminated. 
Just a few months ago, the energy sector was riding high, reaping strong profits from rising electricity demand and higher power prices. Stock-market valuations had been climbing. Many firms had lined up loads of cheap credit that allowed them to finance major infrastructure projects. 
But those conditions evaporated as the financial crisis unfolded this autumn. Stock-market valuations plummeted. The slowing economy ate into the demand for electricity. Power companies, the third largest borrowers after the government and the financial-services industry, could no longer rely on mountains of cheap credit. 
Many energy companies now are having trouble rolling over debt and have drawn down bank lines to keep enough cash on hand to avoid being thrust into unfavorable financial markets. Calpine Corp., a Houston power generator, for example, is hoarding cash to give it protection until 2011. Its stock has fallen 60% this year. 
Some of the first things these companies have trimmed are renewable power projects that were supposed to be the vanguard of the country's new energy future. 
Clear Skies, which canceled its Mojave Desert project, has slashed its 2008 revenue projection to $3 million from $10 million and now is lining up projects with utilities in Greece and India. 
Duke Energy Corp. cut in half a planned $100 million investment in which it would lease space on the roofs of homes and businesses. The plan is to erect solar panels Duke will own to feed electricity directly into the grid. Under pressure from regulators worried about costs, however, Duke scaled the project back to about 4,000 roofs in North Carolina. Duke also is pulling the plug on a $400 million wind-power project it planned to build with a partner. 
Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., New Jersey's largest utility, said it is cutting next year's capital-expenditure budget as much as 15%, with up to 40% of the cut coming from renewable energy. "These are difficult markets and so we're adjusting our spending patterns," says Ralph Izzo, chief executive of PSEG, Newark, N.J. 
FPL Group Inc., one of the country's biggest producers of wind power, said it is cutting capital spending for wind-energy projects by nearly $1 billion next year, reducing the capacity of the planned projects by 27%. 
And one of the nation's biggest utilities, American Electric Power Co. plans to cut capital spending by 23% to about $2.6 billion next year, with more than half the cuts in environmental spending. It plans to delay installation of pollution-control scrubbers on power plants in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma. 
Traditionally, one of the biggest drivers of renewable energy in the U.S. had come from small companies, which develop wind or solar projects and then sell the output to big utilities. The projects were attractive investments because many qualify for tax credits. But many investors who had been seeking tax breaks have disappeared as the stock market tanked and the credit markets froze. 
John Eber, head of renewable energy investing at JP Morgan Capital Corp., said his firm invested $1.7 billion and raised another $2.8 billion for 43 wind farms and a solar project from 2003 through last year. But some of the biggest names, including Wachovia Corp., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group Inc., have dropped out. 
Equity investments in renewable projects may drop 20% this year to about $4 billion, Mr. Eber estimates. 
Even plans to build a new fleet of nuclear reactors face an uncertain future. After a decades-long dormant period, many power companies have been lining up to take part in a 
U.S. revival for nuclear power, an important part of reducing carbon emissions. 
But the prices for steel, concrete and plant equipment have risen just as utilities' ability to finance them has become constrained. Interest costs have increased to two to four times what they were a couple of years ago, greatly inflating the ultimate price tag for the big, lengthy projects. 
Progress Energy Inc. has filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build two new reactors in Florida at a cost of about $17 billion. But the company, which has utilities in the Carolinas and Florida, is worried it might lack the heft to swing the financing. 
"I don't want to find out," says Progress CEO Bill Johnson. He plans to find partners to share the risk and expense and hopes bank financing will thaw by the time financing is needed. 
Many utilities had hoped that the Department of Energy would ease the financing uncertainty by guaranteeing loans. But the department so far has agreed to back only $18.5 billion of the $122 billion in requests for nuclear-reactor loan guarantees. 
The passage of greenhouse-gas legislation would give a boost to nuclear energy because it could push up costs for generators that burn fossil fuels such as coal. But many utility-sector executives and analysts now expect Congress to water down any climate-change legislation out of fear that it would push up electricity prices for consumers. 
Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) chairman of a House panel on energy and air quality, says he's received assurances from the Obama transition team that enacting greenhouse-gas legislation is the new administration's second-highest priority, after fixing the economy. 
But now, facing the dislocation created by the stock market collapse and massive bank losses, Mr. Boucher thinks the new economic realities "dictate a less-expensive program."

Full Text 
From autos to energy to banking, President-elect Barack Obama is promising to intervene in the economy in ways that Washington hasn't tried since the 1970s, favoring some industries and products while hobbling others. 
Under his financial policies, banks seeking government assistance would be forced to lend and to halt foreclosures. Automobile companies would be pushed to change their product lines to more advanced, fuel-efficient vehicles. Billions of federal dollars would promote solar, wind and biomass energy, while dirty coal power could be priced out of business. 
Mr. Obama, in a video for a climate-change summit Tuesday, pledged to pursue energy policies that would reduce greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80% by 2050. Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, speaking to a Wall Street Journal conclave of business leaders Tuesday, said the economic crisis facing the country is "an opportunity to do things you could not do before." 
"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste," Mr. Emanuel said. 
Obama advisers said difficult times necessitate extraordinary measures. "We are in the midst of a massive reorganization right now in autos but also other areas as well -­finance, information technology. All of this flows into . . . the new green energy economy we are living in, albeit in an embryonic stage," said former Rep. David Bonior, an Obama economic adviser and proponent of a more interventionist industrial policy in the 1980s. Asked if this was the industrial policy of the incoming Obama administration, he replied: "The answer is yes." 
Critics and advocates alike see the re-emergence of government economic steering that was in vogue when Japan, South Korea and Germany embraced it three decades ago, then discredited after its key practitioners slipped into deep economic funks. With the upheavals in world capital markets, pure free-market policies are facing more criticism. 
Mr. Obama is by no means an activist in the Japanese mold, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to John McCain's presidential campaign. But as a whole, policies crafted to address distinct problems in the auto, energy and banking sectors are merging into a broader policy that would pick some winners and losers, preserve entire industries and shape consumer choices. 
"We're backing into industrial policy in an emergency to correct massive market failures," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute who has worked with the president-elect's economic team. 
The Bush administration's $700 billion Wall Street rescue plan could be thought of as a state intervention to preserve U.S. dominance in financial services, Mr. Bernstein said. And coming from a conservative Republican administration, the Wall Street rescue plan opened the gates to other economic interventions. 
What is changing is the unabashed nature of the coming interventions, after decades of denial, said Fred Block, a sociologist at the University of California at Davis who studies public-private partnerships. Mr. Obama has said future assistance to the banking sector would be tied to a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures. Advisers are pushing for other conditions to ensure tax money going to the banks would be lent out, not put into the vaults to recapitalize the firms. 
Mr. Obama has promised to throw a financial lifeline to the auto makers in Detroit, but has said firms taking the money would have to change their product lines to emphasize fuel efficiency. Some advisers have suggested a government representative be put on the boards of directors to ensure product transformation was taking place. 
On Tuesday at a governors' conference, Mr. Obama reiterated his intent to cap emissions of greenhouse gases and allow companies to trade permits to emit pollutants like carbon dioxide. Those policies foresee $15 billion a year going to alternative energy sources and nuclear power, while pushing the price of coal up substantially, by forcing coal-fired utilities to purchase the right to burn it. 
Left unsaid was the negative impact those policies could have on disfavored industries. In the closing days of the presidential campaign, political opponents of Mr. Obama brought to light a videotape of the Democrat making that downside clear, and circulated it widely in coal-mining swing states such as West Virginia and Ohio. In it, the candidate said that under his policies, "If somebody wants to build a coal plant, they can -- it's just that it will bankrupt them, because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted." 
Even some Obama allies are queasy about Democratic rescue plans for Detroit. Some Democratic economists say the notion of putting a government-appointed member on the boards of the Big Three could be worse than useless, since it might give the illusion of authority without the actual voting strength to affect corporate decisions.

Food: Heinz Investors Anticipate Answer on Price Increases 
By Julie Jargon 
Investors will be looking for indications of just how much supermarkets have been pushing back on price increases when H.J. Heinz Co. reports earnings Friday. 
Retailers in the U.K., where the ketchup maker generates about 18% of its revenue, have been particularly resistant to accepting price increases as the cost of such 

commodities as corn and fuel have fallen from their peaks and consumers have become more price-sensitive amid the slowing economy. 

Heinz hasn't commented on what kind of pushback, if any, it has gotten, but a Credit Suisse analyst recently said the Pittsburgh-based company has been offering overseas 
retailers more promotional allowances, such as buy-one-get-one-free deals. 
"I feel the general window for pricing has closed," says Edgar Roesch, an analyst with Soleil Securities. 
There already is evidence that higher food prices have turned off shoppers. In August, Heinz raised ketchup prices, according to Credit Suisse, and many consumers have since 

switched to private-label ketchup as a result. Heinz also has experienced a slowdown in its Weight Watchers frozen-meals business as rival Nestle SA slashed prices on its Lean 

Cuisine frozen dinners. 
Unlike some food companies that locked in prices for corn and other ingredients when those commodities were at their peak this summer, Heinz locked in prices in early 2008 
and isn't expected to take the kind of earnings hit that some food makers have. 

Heinz won't enjoy a bump from foreign-exchange rates now that the U.S. dollar has grown stronger. However, "we recently hedged our foreign-exchange translation exposure 
on key currencies for the balance of our fiscal year, which ends in April," Heinz Chief Financial Officer Art Winkleblack told investors last month. 
Analysts are expecting Heinz's profit to have increased 4% to 74 cents a share in its second fiscal quarter. 
Climate Change: 
Disparate Group's Remedy 
Likely to Be Short on Details 

By Jeffrey Ball 
A motley crew of corporations and environmental campaigners is scheduled to call on the U.S. government Tuesday to press forward with legislation to curb global-warming emissions despite the tough economic times. 
The U.S. Climate Action Partnership is such a strange-bedfellows group that, when its members speak with one voice, policy makers take note. But what its leaders don't say at their scheduled Washington news conference this week is likely to be more telling than what they do say. 
The group, known as USCAP, is about as close to a cross-section of the American economy as a Washington interest group gets. Its members include such corporate heavyweights as Detroit's Big Three, several coal-fired power companies and three oil multinationals. Also aboard are a few of the nation's most prominent environmental groups. To put it mildly, these players are seldom on the same team. 
USCAP made waves when it made its debut in January 2007, calling on the government to cap U.S. industry's greenhouse-gas output, though President George W. Bush had made it clear he had no such intention. 
Its rationale was twofold. Major polluters in the group figured it was only a matter of time before a Bush successor hit them with an emissions cap, so they wanted to try to shape the regulation to minimize their costs in complying. Members such as General Electric Co., which makes and sells wind turbines, figured a carbon cap would help it sell more such widgets. 
President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will move forward with instituting a cap on greenhouse-gas emissions. The debate will be over the specifics that will determine which industries, and which companies, get stuck with the bill. 
Don't expect much clarity on that this week. Says a USCAP spokesman: "That's not the purpose of the press conference, to get into the details." 
So far, USCAP has given momentum to the broad idea of a U.S. global-warming mandate. The idea remains mushy, though, because the group's members disagree about what a mandate should say. That's a harbinger of the slugfest that lies ahead over what the U.S. should do about energy and the environment.

The good news: Oil prices have fallen. 
The bad news: Oil prices have fallen. 
Though the soaring cost of oil squeezed consumers' wallets and corporate balance sheets, it had one important benefit: Oil demand in the developed world is projected to decline in 2008 for the third year in a row -- something it hasn't done since the early 1980s -- as motorists kept their cars parked and shifted away from gas guzzlers, and businesses aggressively trimmed fuel costs. Higher prices also spurred development of alternative-energy sources, like solar and biofuels, that cheap oil made uneconomical. 
Now that oil prices are less than half their July peak, what's to keep consumers from returning to their profligate ways? In other words: How do we keep our oil addiction at bay? 
We put that question to a group of energy experts. How do they see the problem? And what can be done to keep the conservation and efficiency momentum going, despite falling oil prices? 
Their prescriptions, presented below in their own words, run the gamut from government mandates that new cars be fuel-flexible to government repeal of all subsidies aimed at fostering energy efficiency. But all agree that there's still plenty to be done to ensure that energy is used efficiently and conservatively, regardless of the price. 
Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R., Maryland) 
Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, Defense Energy Working Group and Congressional Peak Oil Caucus 
DIAGNOSIS: American transportation is more than 95% dependent upon oil, a proportion virtually unchanged since the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Americans will have spent $700 billion on oil imports in the last two years. That is more than we spend annually on defense. If that money stayed here, it would generate $7 trillion in economic activity. Clearly, lower oil prices are better for Americans and worse for the governments of OPEC countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela as well as Russia's military resurgence. If we reduce our dependence upon oil imports, we eliminate our greatest self-imposed threat to Americans' future economic prosperity and national security. Especially in the absence of price signals, we need leadership at all levels to inspire Americans to continue conserving oil and to innovate to shift our transportation and manufacturing sectors off oil. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Employers should adopt four-day workweeks and permit or expand telecommuting. A four-day workweek would eliminate 20% of commuting. Telecommuting could eliminate even more. Management Technology Associates studies show win-win-win benefits. Businesses reduce premises' costs, overhead and labor with gains in productivity of 10%-40%. Workers enjoy significant fuel and time savings. Society reduces fuel use, traffic congestion and pollution. 
-- Employers should monetarily reward employees who car-pool or move closer to work. One example: The federal HUBZone Program administered by the Small Business Administration provides federal contracting preferences to small businesses located in underutilized urban and rural communities. HUBZone businesses' principal office must be located, and at least 35% of their staff reside, within a HUBZone. Sycamore.US, in my district, provides its employees who move into their HUBZone an additional $400 a month as well as up to $666 a year to employees who car-pool, use public transportation or use people power, such as bicycling. 
-- Individuals and businesses should take advantage of federal tax credits for fuel-efficient cars. There are credits of up to $3,400 for a new hybrid, between $2,500 and $7,500 for a plug-in auto under 10,000 pounds, and up to $15,000 for a plug-in vehicle over 26,000 pounds. 
-- The federal government should require all new cars sold in the U.S. to be fuel-flexible -- capable of using gasoline, ethanol or methanol. We have no idea which liquid fuel substitutes for oil could be in use over the 15-year average life span of a vehicle. This should be adopted as a condition of additional federal assistance to shore up the auto industry, and would add only about $100 to $200 to the cost of most vehicles. 
-- Washington should enact new tax rebates to reward purchases of more fuel-efficient automobiles, which would be paid for with tax penalties for the purchase of less fuel-efficient cars. 
-- The federal government should provide incentives to states to impose higher license fees for bigger and less fuel-efficient vehicles based upon engine displacement and fuel efficiency. Washington has previously encouraged state seatbelt and other laws by withholding a portion of federal highway funds unless the states adopt the policy. 
R. James Woolsey 
Venture Partner with VantagePoint Venture Partners; former U.S. Director of Central Intelligence 
DIAGNOSIS: Oil first skyrocketed to over $140 a barrel, and then tanked (well, relatively) to under $60. Will we now forget our earlier resolution to kick the oil habit as we have before? 
No. It's true that after oil prices dipped in the mid-1980s and the late '90s, work on several alternative fuels was abandoned. But important developments in the past five to 10 years should enable us to use competition to destroy the 96% monopoly that oil enjoys over transportation. Added taxes on oil or gasoline aren't necessary -- we just need to use government's power to open up competition in the transportation fuel market. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Congress needs to condition some part of the $25 billion for rescuing auto companies on their moving rapidly to produce vehicles that use electric power. It should also require that some significant share of cars purchased by the government use electricity. With a plug-in hybrid you will be able drive all-electric at a cost of only two to four cents a mile for the first 20-40 miles each day. For an average amount of daily driving your electricity cost will beat the pants off gasoline costing 10 cents to 20 cents a mile. OPEC can't drop oil's price enough to compete with electricity. 
-- Congress should use rescue funds to mandate that new cars be fuel-flexible for a range of fuels. Several alcohol-based, low-carbon-emitting fuels produced from biomass and waste feedstocks are developing as important potential partners with electricity in breaking oil's monopoly. The transition to fuel flexibility costs under $100 per new car and should be rapid. Brazil took only three years to transition from 5% of new cars being fuel-flexible vehicles to 75%. 
-- We should borrow the successful German model of the "feed-in tariff" -- which requires utilities to pay customers who generate renewable energy a fixed, above-market rate for power. The dropping costs of both solar panels and electricity storage will soon let you charge your plug-in at night from new "flow" batteries in your basement, and then drive the next day powered by the sunlight that fell on your roof the day before. Let OPEC see if it can figure out how to monopolize that. 
-- Charging cars' batteries at night means that driving on electricity won't require new power plants. But Congress needs to improve the grid's security and resilience against thunderstorms, hackers and terrorists by giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needed emergency authority. 
-- We need to grow and maintain substantial battery development and manufacturing technology in the U.S. Congress should establish a battery version of Sematech, the public-private partnership that was set up in the 1980s to ensure that the U.S. stayed in the business of developing and manufacturing semiconductors in the face of international competitors that were often heavily state-aided. We shouldn't replace foreign oil dependence with foreign battery dependence. 
Amy Myers Jaffe 
Fellow in Energy Studies, Baker Institute; Associate Director of the Energy Program, Rice University 
DIAGNOSIS: For the first time in years, Americans are driving less, and U.S. oil demand is down, helping reduce not only the U.S. trade deficit but the global price for oil. But we want falling oil demand to reflect more than an economic downturn. We want it to be the result of conscious, sustainable policies. If our newfound conservation efforts and energy policies give way to old profligate energy habits when this new round of contraction ends, as happened in the 1980s, we will have lost yet another opportunity to get out of the vicious circle of repeated energy and financial crises. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Use any Detroit bailout to increase federal fuel-efficiency standards. According to a study by the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, the new 35-mile-per-gallon fuel-efficiency standard will shave 2.3 million barrels a day from U.S. oil demand by 2020. We must not undo this regulation because Detroit has fallen on hard times. If we were able to fashion a bailout plan that required our car companies to use federal bailout money to raise this target to a more ambitious 50 miles to the gallon, we could save as much as six million to seven million barrels of oil a day. 
-- Increase federal gasoline taxes. Sadly, the easiest way to hold the gains we have made in reducing oil demand in the U.S. would be to raise federal gasoline taxes as prices fall to lock in a floor price that will continue to stimulate conservation. Some portion of the funds could be set aside for research in alternative energy. 
-- Make electricity the energy of the future. Canada, France, Germany and the U.S. generate electricity generally without recourse to oil. As a substitute for gasoline, hybrid plug-in cars would give consumers the flexibility to shift fuels when oil is expensive or in short supply. The flexibility to shift among fuels to generate electricity would reduce the oil intensity of the U.S. economy and shrink the financial crises that have tended to go with oil price shocks. Over time, as carbon is restricted, we could encourage the generation of more and more electricity with cleaner fuels such as nuclear, solar and wind, or sequester the carbon from coal burned for power generation. 
Amory Lovins 
Chairman and Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountain Institute 
DIAGNOSIS: Efficiency is one of the highest-return and lowest-risk investments in the entire economy, no matter how low energy prices might go. Concerns about national energy security and about climate persist even if fuel prices drop. Making our energy supplies affordable, secure and climate-safe all require exactly the same actions -- mainly energy efficiency -- so it doesn't matter which of them you care most about. And energy efficiency's side benefits are often more valuable than reduced energy costs: higher labor productivity in efficient offices, higher retail sales in well-daylit shops, faster learning in well-daylit schools, faster healing in green and efficient hospitals, and higher throughput, flexibility and quality in efficient factories. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Reward electric and gas utilities for cutting our bills, not selling us more energy. Half the states have recently adopted or are considering reforms to reverse old perverse incentives by decoupling utilities' profits from their sales volumes (so they're no longer rewarded for selling more energy nor penalized for selling less), and then letting them keep, as extra profit, a small but juicy fraction, perhaps a tenth, of what they save their customers. 
-- Introduce "feebates" (fee + rebate) for light vehicles. In each size class, buyers of inefficient models pay a fee while those who purchase efficient models earn a rebate paid for by others' fees. This increases the price spread between less and more efficient models of each size class, so customers consider life-cycle fuel savings, not just the first year or two. Auto makers will make higher profits, because shifting their offerings from fee-paying to rebate-earning means adding technology content that has a higher margin than the rest of the vehicle. 
-- Use creative financing to help low-income Americans get new very efficient cars bundled with insurance and price-hedged gasoline. Scrap dirty old cars a few years early. Net result: a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit among customers who couldn't previously qualify for a new car; cleaner air; faster oil savings; and astonishing new employment opportunities for low-income citizens who couldn't previously get to work. 
-- Allow businesses to expense energy-saving investments that are now capitalized, so those investments compete on a level playing field with the tax-deductible energy costs they save. This policy should be broadly stimulative. 
-- Above all, adopt an economically conservative energy policy that allows and requires all ways to save or produce energy to compete fairly at honest prices, regardless of their type, technology, size, location, or ownership . . . and let's see who's not in favor of that! 
Myron Ebell 
Director of Energy and Global Warming Policy, Competitive Enterprise Institute 
DIAGNOSIS: Conserving energy and improving energy efficiency are good things insofar as they contribute to economic efficiency. But I am concerned that much of the public-policy debate is about pursuing energy conservation and efficiency measures that go far beyond any economic benefits. In reaction to the OPEC oil embargoes of the early 1970s, Japan became the most energy-efficient economy in the world, but at much too high a cost, which contributed to Japan's economic stagnation. As for the indirect benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency almost always leads in the long term to higher energy consumption. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Congress and state legislatures should repeal all energy-efficiency mandates and subsidies. Mandates and subsidies cause people and companies to do things that are otherwise uneconomic. This misallocation of resources in the long term leads to less economic activity, which slows down the rate of technological innovation and thereby leads to less progress in using energy more efficiently. Energy efficiency is increasing at a faster rate in the U.S. than in the European Union largely because of faster economic growth and more technological innovation. 
-- Government should replace the tax-depreciation schedule for investments in new capital stock with immediate expensing. New equipment is almost always more energy-efficient than old. Changing the tax structure so that new investments could be written off immediately would make it profitable to replace old with new equipment at a much quicker pace. This simple change could do more to increase energy efficiency throughout the economy than all the current mandates and subsidies. 
-- People and businesses should oppose all energy-rationing policies, such as cap-and-trade schemes to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Energy rationing forces people to pay more for energy and therefore to use less of it. Enacting cap-and-trade legislation would force some conservation and efficiency gains, but would also lower economic growth and thereby lower the rate of technological innovation. 
Phil Sharp 
President, Resources for the Future 
DIAGNOSIS: We have security, environmental and economic stakes in advancing efficiency in the production, distribution and especially the use of energy. But uncertainty about the future direction of energy prices is compounded by the credit crisis, which threatens to undermine recent investments in efficiency or renewable fuels, and the fiscal crisis facing state and federal budgets, which raises questions about sustaining government incentives. 
Given the challenge of climate change and the risks in the international oil market, we cannot leave all the decisions to an unfettered market. But government policies must avoid highly prescriptive regulation and wherever possible capitalize on the dynamism of markets and the power of price. This is no time for rigid adherence to past ideologies of the left or right. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- Implement tax incentives and standards -- including building codes, fuel-economy standards and appliance-efficiency standards -- to encourage greater efficiency. Tax incentives, however, decline in effectiveness in the face of price declines, and standards work best when reinforced by market prices. 
-- Adopt the long-term architecture for restraining greenhouse-gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide. The central feature would place a price on carbon in our energy system by means of a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system -- a price that rises over time. This provides price incentives to advance a low-carbon future -- which must include major efficiency gains. 
-- Give serious consideration to proposals to impose a "price floor" on oil of, say, $60 or $65 a barrel, with a tax. This could reduce the variance of oil prices and provide alternative-energy and conservation ventures with a reasonable degree of confidence in their project planning. But the political calculus for this policy is obviously difficult and requires careful examination of the interrelationship with a carbon pricing scheme. 
Andrew Liveris 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dow Chemical Co. 
DIAGNOSIS: Demand for oil is outpacing the supply of this precious resource. A new energy policy is just as important to the economy as any rescue of the financial markets. In fact, it's more important in the medium to long term. We are on a pattern to spend more than $500 billion per year to import oil -- nearly the amount authorized one time for the financial rescue package recently passed by Congress. This continued dependency on oil imports has national-security as well as economic consequences. It is also detrimental to manufacturing and energy-consuming sectors -- like the chemical industry. Unstable prices also impact household energy bills and inflation of everyday goods. 
PRESCRIPTIONS 
-- President Obama should use his "bully pulpit" to issue a national call to action on energy efficiency. We need a national goal of 25% improvement in energy efficiency and conservation over the next 10 years to galvanize the public. If the U.S. adopted this economy-wide goal, we could effectively save the BTU energy equivalent of all the U.S. oil imports from the Arabian Gulf. 
-- We should seek a combination of federal financial incentives and energy-efficiency building codes for our homes and buildings to increase efficiency by 30% over 10 years. Homes and buildings account for 40% of U.S. energy demand and 50% of greenhouse-gas emissions. Solutions could include increasing federal tax credits and incentives for new and existing buildings to improve energy-efficiency performance; fully funding the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which authorized funds to help states improve compliance with stronger building codes, to finance energy-efficiency public information programs and to pay for other green building initiatives; and implementing voluntary green building programs that establish standards and targets to guide contractors and home builders. 
-- Extend federal energy-tax incentives. Passing long-term tax incentives would encourage the market to continue investing in and deploying energy-efficient products and technology. With the federal energy-tax incentives extended eight to 10 years, the public would have time to modify its behavior to adopt and purchase energy-efficient products. 
-- Adopt diplomacy on behalf of energy efficiency. The next president should make energy efficiency a central part of U.S. foreign policy and global climate change negotiating strategy. The U.S. could serve as the catalyst for encouraging world governments to embrace efficiency and conservation as their first choice of energy. If the Group of Eight industrialized countries increased their rate of energy-efficiency improvement to 2.5% a year (double the global average), our world could avoid $3 trillion worth of new power generation, eliminate the amount of energy supplied by 2,000 coal-fired power plants, and mitigate the rise of greenhouse-gas emissions by holding CO2 concentrations below 550 parts per million.

BEIJING -- A roughly two-mile thick cloud of soot and smog hanging over most of Asia is wrecking havoc on agriculture and health but masking the effects of global warming, a United Nations study found. 
The atmospheric brown cloud made of different particles resulting mostly from burning coal is causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in Asia and billions of dollars in economic losses, the study said. But it helps reduce the impact of climate change by between 20% and 80%, said the report released Thursday by the Project Atmospheric Brown Cloud, established by the United Nations Environment Program. 
The cloud's impact is worst over the developing countries in Asia, where some half of the world's population lives, the study said. The finding echoes previous research that found the soot from coal burning in countries like China, the world's leading user of coal, is helping mitigate global warming by shading the sun. Fossil fuels, when burned, emit both global-warming gases and pollutants that cause smog. 
That finding illustrates the complexity of balancing economic growth against reducing pollution. Moving too quickly to reduce some types of pollution without reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses could have disastrous consequences, the study said. 
Eliminating the cloud would rapidly increase global temperatures two degrees Celsius, which coupled with the already measured rise of 0.75 degrees in the 20th century could push world climate past what scientists consider a dangerous threshold. 
Outdoor pollutants could kill 340,000 people a year in China and India, while indoor pollution, from sources such as open wood fire stoves, is killing another 780,000 in the two countries, the UN said.

Abstract 
California Democrat Henry Waxman kicked things off the morning after Barack Obama's victory, with an announcement that he will seek the chairmanship of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Congressman has spent the last year trying to dragoon the Environmental Protection Agency into imposing an economy-wide carbon clampdown under current clean-air laws, an idea Mr. Obama also backs. 

Full Text 
The champagne is barely off the ice and Democrats are already celebrating their new majorities by punishing a few heretical colleagues. In almost every sense, John Dingell and Joe Lieberman are loyal Democrats. But Mr. Dingell is holding down the party's right flank on energy, and Mr. Lieberman in foreign affairs. Now they're targets, and the retribution speaks volumes about the direction of liberal politics. 
California Democrat Henry Waxman kicked things off the morning after Barack Obama's victory, with an announcement that he will seek the chairmanship of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. The post is currently held by Mr. Dingell, the bulldog Michigander who next year will become the longest-serving Member in U.S. history. In Congressional physics, seniority is gravity, which alone makes Mr. Waxman's challenge extraordinary. 
It is even more so because it is a coup d'etat against a climate- change moderate. For environmentalists, Mr. Dingell is a wet blanket because his committee will write any global-warming legislation. The word on the Hill is that Mr. Waxman enjoys the tacit support of ubergreen Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who dislikes Mr. Dingell's independence. 
In media shorthand, Mr. Dingell's approach to climate change is called "industry friendly." Apparently, this is because his principles include words like "realistic" and "achievable" and "cost containment." An ally of the Detroit auto makers, he does not pretend that putting a price on carbon will be painless and fun. He also knows that well-to-do redoubts such as Mr. Waxman's Beverly Hills won't bear the heaviest burden. It will fall instead on blue-collar, middle- American regions that rely on manufacturing or coal-fired power. 
Even so, Mr. Dingell's committee has held nearly 30 hearings on climate change since his party took power. In October, he released a cap-and-trade bill that aims to reduce emissions to 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. Incredibly enough, even that huge cut counts as a liberal heresy. The greens demand 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 -- a meaningless distinction considering that four decades is a political and technological eternity. 
Then again, compared to Mr. Waxman, just about anyone could be mistaken for an Exxon executive. The Congressman has spent the last year trying to dragoon the Environmental Protection Agency into imposing an economy-wide carbon clampdown under current clean-air laws, an idea Mr. Obama also backs. But Mr. Dingell dares to point out that these laws -- passed in 1970, 1977 and 1990 -- were never written to include CO2. He should know. He wrote them. 
The point is not only to humiliate a nuisance. Installing Mr. Waxman at Energy and Commerce would mean a far more aggressive push on global warming next year. It would also send a warning to the Blue Dogs and rural-state Democrats who might not fall in with the Obama-Pelosi energy agenda. Think rubber truncheons and bare light bulbs (compact fluorescents, of course). 
Like Mr. Dingell, Senator Lieberman may also lose his gavel. Last week, Majority Leader Harry Reid informed the Connecticut renegade that rank-and-file sentiment against him had climbed to a point where he could not stay as Homeland Security Chairman. He may also be booted from the Democratic caucus. 
To hear Democrats tell it, much less the Angry Left, Mr. Lieberman is Judas, Brutus and Cassius rolled into one. They're still furious about his high-profile campaign for John McCain, including his speech at the GOP convention. They also want to exact revenge for his unstinting support of President Bush's Iraq policy. 
In 2006, Mr. Lieberman was defrocked for the sole reason that as a matter of policy and conscience he refused to repudiate the war that he and so many of his party colleagues had voted for. After Mr. Lieberman lost his Senate primary race to the antiwar Greenwich millionaire Ned Lamont, nearly all Senate Democrats were happy to abandon their friend and endorse Mr. Lamont. Chris Dodd, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obama and the rest didn't even have the courage to stay neutral, for fear of affronting the empurpled left. 
Were he a vindictive man, Mr. Lieberman could have returned the favor after he won the general election as an independent. With the Senate split 50 to 49, he might have handed control back to the GOP. Instead, he caucused with the Democrats and voted with them on social and economic issues. Now that they have comfortable margins, his reward may be a complete purge. 
If a venerable New Deal liberal first elected in 1955 and a Vice Presidential nominee only two elections ago aren't fit for polite Democratic company, it shows how far left the party's center has shifted.

Full Text 
LONDON -- The U.K.'s hopes of becoming a world leader in the battle against global warming suffered a potential setback when BP PLC said it had pulled out of a competition to design the country's first carbon capture-and-storage project. 
The announcement came as the British oil major said it would be concentrating its wind investments in the U.S., effectively exiting the U.K. wind power market. 
Carbon capture and storage -- known as CCS -- is critical to U.K. energy policy. The U.K. says it will cut carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 -- a target it can achieve only if it can work out a way to sequester and safely store the carbon dioxide emitted by its coal- fired power stations. 
CCS has so far never been applied on a commercial scale, and there are fears the costs will be prohibitive. Some companies developing the technology say it won't work without big financial incentives. 
The U.K. government announced in July it had shortlisted four bidders to develop the country's first CCS demonstration project -- BP Alternative Energy, E.ON AG, Peel Holdings and ScottishPower, the U.K. arm of Spain's Iberdrola SA. 
But BP is pulling out. "We don't believe we can put together a consortium that would win the competition," said spokesman David Nicholas. He said BP had failed to find a power generator that it could partner with. 
The government said BP's move wouldn't affect the competition. "We continue to have three strong bidders who are committed to the project and to CCS," said a spokeswoman. 
But the project is facing problems on other fronts. RWE npower, the U.K. subsidiary of German utility RWE AG, has said it will seek a judicial review of the government's decision to leave it off the shortlist. 
BP has already backed out of one CCS venture in the U.K. Last year, it abandoned a trial project in Peterhead, Scotland, saying the government's timetable for a competition to win financing for a prototype plant was too slow. 
Mr. Nicholas said the decision on the demonstration project didn't reflect a change in BP's views on carbon capture. He said BP remained committed to Hydrogen Energy, its 50­50 joint venture with mining giant Rio Tinto PLC, which is developing two carbon-capture projects, one in California and the other in Abu Dhabi. 
BP also said this week that it wouldn't be pursuing wind-power initiatives in the U.K., concentrating instead on the U.S., where it said the economics made more sense. BP already has a large development portfolio in the U.S., with 15,000 megawatts of capacity.

Corrections & Amplifications 
On average, 200 watts of sunlight fall on each square meter of the Earth's surface, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A cover article in the Weekend Journal on Nov. 8 incorrectly said an average of 1,366 watts of sunlight fall on each square meter of the Earth's surface. 
(WSJ Nov. 15, 2008) 
(See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Red Herrings Are Not a Species Needing Protection" -- WSJ November 19, 2008) 
[As Barack Obama shifts from a waking dream to the real world, he faces the near-virtual reality of climate change. He has to move decisively, Ian McEwan writes.] 
I refute it thus!" was Samuel Johnson's famous, beefy riposte one morning after church in 1763. As he spoke, according to his friend James Boswell, he kicked "with mighty force" a large stone "till he rebounded from it." The good Dr. Johnson was contesting Bishop Berkeley's philosophical idealism, the view that the external, physical world does not exist and is the product of the mind. It was never much of a disproof, but we can sympathize with its sturdy common sense and physical display of Anglo-Saxon, if not Anglican, pragmatism. 
Still, we may have proved Berkeley partially correct; in an age of electronic media, where rumor, opinion and fact are tightly interleaved, and where politicians must sing to compete for our love, public affairs have the quality of a waking dream, a collective solipsism whose precise connection to the world of kickable stones is obscure, though we are certain that it exists. 
The contest for the presidency, like all elections, had the self-enclosed quality of a squash game, a chess match, a post-modern novel -- and this one was far better than most. While the candidates appeared to address an external reality, they were bound by strictly ethereal requirements: to cast spells on large crowds while seeming ordinary, to trample their opponent into oblivion while seeming pleasant, to be inspirational yet sensible, to avoid offending a score of sensitive constituencies, and, an old wizard's touch, to promise the electorate various gifts without further borrowing or raising taxes. 
And to win. As Barack Obama steps forward, the smoke machines and mirrors are packed away -- or perhaps we can never, or should never, let them go. In the deepest Democratic heartland of lower Manhattan, voters who prided themselves on their political nous spoke of being tearful even as they cast their votes. Many in the mostly white, highly educated crowd I spent the evening with wept openly as they watched Obama on television delivering his acceptance speech. They were overwhelmed by the symbolic force of a simple fact -- that an African-American was to be their next president. And even as they insisted that they knew very well that one man alone could not repair their country or the world, in their hearts they were counting on him to do just that. People also murmured of their deepest fear -- that this precious achievement could be snatched away by some act of violence, by an apparition from the darkest recesses of the nation's unconscious. We were still in a world of dreams, of shadows on walls. 
Meanwhile, the departing President has been energetically pulling levers in the real world, facilitating coal-fired power plants, opening up federally owned wilderness to oil and gas drilling and encouraging the commercial exploitation of oil shale. This will all have to be reversed by President-elect Obama. To those who believe that climate change is our most pressing problem, underpinning all others, requiring degrees of cooperation and rationality we might not even be capable of, the elevation of this slender, handsome man becomes the object of unreal expectation. Inevitably, after a long campaign of crowd pleasing, the question hangs in the air: Is he merely the expert coiner of a stirring speech, or does he have the steel to turn intentions into results? At the very least, the country finally has a president who, whatever his profession of faith, has a high regard for science (look at his sturdy views on intelligent design in Nature magazine of Sept. 25) and has surrounded himself with scientific advisers of impeccable quality, and committed himself to the dreamy target of an 80% reduction below 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050. 
The issue of climate change is itself another near-virtual reality. Ever since 1979, when James Hansen's Ad Hoc Group on CO2 reported to President Carter, there have been symposia, denials, summits, documentaries, marches, legislation, trading schemes and, above all, resounding speeches high on ambition -- in Europe we rather excel at these. 
However, on the all-too-kickable stone we call the Earth, where results from thousands of sophisticated thermometers in oceans and on land masses are mapped against satellite data, the mean temperature has continued to rise. In 2007 the shrinking of the summer ice in the Arctic exceeded the gloomiest predictions. Data for the past year, during an economic downturn, show CO2 levels rising as fast as ever. It is doubtful whether there is yet a single recorded instance of a carbon-producing power station taken out of commission to make way for a clean energy installation. These past 30 years we have dealt with this issue, if at all, only in our minds. There are, of course, first signs of a new infrastructure -- along certain stretches of Danish coast line, on some German and Japanese rooftops, in certain deserts -- but the effect so far is minuscule. We are still dreaming, still murmuring in our sleep as we grope for the levers that connect thoughts to actions. 
Domestically, Mr. Obama will have a number of factors on his side, beyond good working majorities in both houses. There is at least agreement that there is a problem -- for the past several years, the science has been beyond doubt, the data are in across many fields of study -- anthropogenic climate change is a fact. Doing nothing is simply too expensive. A good part of the Republican Party accepts this, as do major corporations, and even oil companies. The deniers are folding their tents -- and what was to deny? A molecule of CO2 absorbs the longer wave length of light, trapping radiant heat from the Earth. More CO2, more trapped warmth. If temperatures drift much beyond two degrees above pre-industrial levels, the human and economic consequences could be catastrophic. We have already seen what happens when a warmer Atlantic Ocean lends its energy to the hurricane season. 
Thus the matter is passing from virtue, from idealism and somber invitations to self-denial, which government, markets and the electorate distrust, to self-interest and necessity, for which we all have respect. Oil production will soon decline, and alternatives must be found anyway; many oil-producing countries are grisly human constructs on which no one wants to depend; if the U.S. does not invest in renewable energy technologies now, it will have to buy them later from its competitors; Germany has created a quarter of a million jobs in renewable energy; it is beginning to be apparent that there is a vast amount of money to be made retooling and supplying a whole civilization with new energy sources. 
The technologies are developing at speed, but the basic ideas have a simple allure. Consider just one form of solar energy. An alien landing on our planet and noticing how it was bathed in light would be amazed to learn that we believe ourselves to have an energy problem, that we ever should have thought of overheating or poisoning ourselves by burning fossil fuels or generating plutonium. Sunlight falls on us in a constant stream, a sweet rain of photons beyond counting. On average, 1,366 watts for every square meter of the Earth's surface. A single photon striking a semi-conductor releases an electron, and so electricity is born, right out of sunbeams. These are the photovoltaics that Einstein described and for which he won a Nobel Prize. If you believed in God, you might say this free energy was His greatest gift. Let there be light! If you did not, you might say, how auspicious are the laws of physics. As is often pointed out, less than an hour's worth of all the sunlight falling on the Earth would satisfy the whole world's needs for a year. A fraction of our hot deserts could power our civilization. 
Millions of acres in the southwestern deserts have already been identified for suitable sites. Installations are beginning to appear, some of them funded by European companies taking advantage of state tax-breaks. In private and public labs, new technologies are being invented. How can a solar or wind plant generate power by night? Daniel Nocera at MIT has imitated photosynthesis to crack water efficiently into hydrogen and oxygen; at night these gases are re-combined in a fuel cell to drive a turbine. In other labs, the race is on for that industrial golden egg, a cheaper, lighter, more powerful battery for use in electric automobiles; nanotechnology is being used to derive two electrons from one photon; thin film solar panels are already in production; other labs are working on solar paints. The lines of inquiry are proliferating by the thousands. That resourceful Californian generation that made its fortune refining the Internet is reliving its youth in clean energy. The whole sector is like a coiled spring, waiting to unleash its full force into the economy. 
In other words, Mr. Obama assumes power at a time when renewable energy has ceased to be a marginal pursuit. The hour may have summoned the man, but this happens to be a particularly difficult hour. In Berkeleyan mode, we have entered a recession because we always thought we would. The fictional head of a snake has begun to devour its actually existing tail -- a circularity the great Argentinean fabulist, Borges, would have appreciated. We dreamed of this recession, we saw it coming and we made it so. Meanwhile, in the Johnsonian "real" economy, factories, distribution systems, human inventiveness, the will to work, the need for goods and services are much as they were last year -- except, as certainty of the recession tightens, we fear more and spend less, corporations begin their layoffs, and so our recession is locked in. 
Beyond that, the problems are solvable, but they are formidable too. Solar- and wind-generating plants are often far from cities; a new Direct Current grid is needed; the costs will be enormous; the benefits will not be immediately obvious to many consumers; and the government has colossal debts. Coal remains a crucial energy source, but "clean" coal is still a fantasy, and piping CO2 to the appropriate geological sites and pumping it underground is expensive. Oil interests will not be happy with their loss of supremacy and ancient privileges, or with contemplating a cap-and-trade scheme during a recession. Acceptable electric vehicles are still a good way off. And beyond the administrative and technological problems, there are the usual obstacles. It is not only Harold Macmillan's "events, dear boy, events" that can blow a thoughtful politician off course. There are mistakes, enemies, political process, the fumblings or ambitious scheming of lieutenants, the fading novelty of a new presidential face. And above all, undue caution. 
There is a growing consensus among climate scientists that we have less than eight years to start making a significant impact on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, eight years to move from Berkeley's solipsism to Johnson's pragmatism. Thereafter, as tipping points are reached, as feedback loops strengthen, the emissions curve will rise too quickly for us to restrain it. In the words of John Schellnhuber, one of Europe's leading climate scientists and Chief Scientific Adviser to Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, "what is required is an industrial revolution for sustainability, starting now." 
To be effective, this is only possible at the level of international cooperation -- far more difficult to achieve than any technological breakthrough. There is a rendezvous next year in Copenhagen in late November which the entire world of climate expertise is preparing itself for and which is considered by many in the field to be our best and possibly last hope of addressing the problem before it runs away from us. It is the truly global successor to Kyoto, known in the trade as COP (Conference of Parties) 15. There is a case to be made that it will be one of the most important international meetings ever convened. If it does not result in practical, radical measures, the fight to control our future could well be lost. Every nation on the planet will be represented. The general feeling is that the conference cannot be allowed to fail. And it cannot succeed without the leadership of the United States. There are fears that Mr. Obama will move too cautiously on climate change for political reasons, and that would be a tragic error. As Mr. Schellnhuber says, "If he were prepared to come in person to Copenhagen and make a speech, a bold commitment, similar to what Reagan did in Reykjavik, he would become a hero of the planet, for good." 
And so the mechanisms of the unreal, the smoke and mirrors, might have to come to the aid of our actually existing, overheating world. The process that let us believe we were dealing with climate change when we were doing nothing at all, or let us think our way into a recession -- these emanations of collective and collusive dreaming can have their positive side. Barack Obama may succeed in tipping the nations toward a low-carbon future simply because people think he can. Scientists, whose stock in trade is skepticism, and conference-weary diplomats along with millions around the world are attributing to him something like unearthly powers. He is invested with more symbolism -- of renewal, of rationality -- than his slight frame can bear. But having persuaded everybody else, he may be doubly persuaded himself. This aura will be his empowerment, as numinous as good luck, as permanent as spring snow. He has to move decisively. 
There are those who said during the campaign that Barack Obama turned a fine speech empty of intent. He must surprise his detractors and start the detailed, practical preparation for Copenhagen, and refute them thus!

Abstract 
The jobs would include insulation installers, to make houses more energy-efficient, wind-turbine builders, to displace coal- fired electricity, and construction workers, to build greener buildings and upgrade the electrical grid. Unlike the fossil-fuel industry, which has matured over decades, it is just starting to build its basic infrastructure -- wind turbines, solar panels and a more-sophisticated electric-transmission grid. 

Full Text 
Calls for a clean-energy system in the U.S. have long met with sticker shock. Now, the cost of making the transition -- hundreds of billions of dollars -- is being touted as a selling point. 
President-elect Barack Obama and his energy advisers have been making the case that a multibillion-dollar government investment in everything from wind turbines to a "smart" electrical grid is just what's needed to help revive the economy. The lure is millions of government-subsidized "green jobs." 
On the campaign trail, Mr. Obama argued that spending $150 billion over the next decade to boost energy efficiency would help create five million jobs. The jobs would include insulation installers, to make houses more energy-efficient, wind-turbine builders, to displace coal- fired electricity, and construction workers, to build greener buildings and upgrade the electrical grid. 
The numbers are debated by the Obama advisers themselves, and are likely to spark debate when Congress considers a stimulus package including green jobs. But a big government push, focused on jobs, may represent the best chance in years for renewable energy and energy efficiency to take root in the U.S., a voracious energy consumer. 
"It's a terrible situation that we find ourselves in," says Bracken Hendricks, an energy adviser to Mr. Obama and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning Washington think tank. "But it's exciting that these issues are getting some attention." 
The green-jobs argument rests on the notion that big capital investments in new-energy technology today will be more than offset by savings in reduced fossil-fuel costs. Though oil prices have fallen, the International Energy Agency predicted Thursday that once the economy picks up again, they will resume climbing, potentially topping $200 a barrel by 2030. The IEA called the current energy system "patently unsustainable" and called for "radical action by governments." 
The added allure of clean-energy spending as economic stimulus is that the industry is relatively young and growing fast. Unlike the fossil-fuel industry, which has matured over decades, it is just starting to build its basic infrastructure -- wind turbines, solar panels and a more-sophisticated electric-transmission grid. 
Several studies estimate that $1 invested in renewable energy or energy efficiency would yield up to four times as many jobs as $1 invested in oil and gas, whose basic infrastructure of wells, refineries and pipelines has been around for years. Moreover, those studies say, clean-energy jobs are likely to be centered in the U.S., unlike jobs in the oil and gas industry, which increasingly are spread around the world. 
Critics say analyzing only new green jobs misses half the story. 
"It's not looking at the other side of the coin: You are spending more money for your energy," says Anne Smith, a vice president at CRA International. The consulting firm wrote a report for the coal-mining industry in April that concluded that, under a bill to cap global- warming emissions, gains in green jobs would be "more than offset" by job losses elsewhere in the economy. That bill failed, but Mr. Obama has said he supports capping emissions. 
The green-jobs argument isn't new. In the 1970s, amid an energy and economic crisis, President Jimmy Carter cited job creation as one reason for his calls to increase federal spending on renewable-energy research and development. But the argument has taken on new life in the past few years, as environmental activists have concluded that saving the planet isn't enough to make most Americans support higher government spending. 
The job creation number cited by Mr. Obama has its roots in several green-jobs studies. Each projected different numbers, because each made different assumptions -- for instance, about the number of additional jobs that would be created by the spending of every person directly employed in a green job. 
Robert Pollin, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who co-wrote another study, questions the job target touted by the Obama campaign, saying it would cost much more. 
Mr. Pollin's study, sponsored by the Center for American Progress, came out in September, after green jobs had become a theme on the presidential campaign trail. It said that $100 billion spent over two years could produce two million green jobs. 
Even Mr. Pollin's study assessed only the number of jobs that might be added if the government spent more money on clean energy. It didn't count jobs that might be lost elsewhere in the economy if the country shifted to costlier sources of energy. 
Mr. Pollin says he's working on a fuller study now. He and other green-jobs advocates say that, on balance, shifting to cleaner sources of energy creates more jobs than it destroys. 
The Apollo Alliance, a San Francisco coalition of environmental and labor groups, also released a study in September. It concluded that five million green jobs could be had with an investment of $500 billion -- more than three times Mr. Obama's number. 
Kate Gordon, co-director of the Apollo Alliance, says the numbers are less important than the message. "Honestly," she says, "it's just to inspire people."

Now that Barack Obama has vanquished John McCain, he faces a much greater foe: Democrats on Capitol Hill. They've humbled the last two Democratic Presidents -- and with their enhanced majorities next year, they'll be out to do it again. 
Mr. Obama may appreciate the threat, because yesterday he offered Clinton White House veteran Rahm Emanuel a job as his chief of staff. But even that savvy, relatively sane liberal will have difficulties grappling with the fearsome committee chairmen and liberal interest groups that did so much to sabotage Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Meet the President-elect's real opposition: 
-- David Obey. The Appropriations Chairman wants to slash defense spending as a money grab for more social programs and entitlements. Fellow spender Barney Frank recently added that a military budget cut of 25% was about right. A military crash diet wouldn't leave the funds for the surge in Afghanistan that Mr. Obama advocates, and it's a sure way to hand the national security issue back to the GOP. 
-- Chuck Schumer. The Senate Democrat and his friends are already threatening banks if they don't lend more money instantly under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Other political masters want to use Tarp to nationalize large swaths of U.S. industry such as the Detroit auto makers or to bail out states like New York that are in debt. If Mr. Obama doesn't want to have to pass a Tarp II, he'll have to say no. 
-- George Miller. Some Democrats are starting to target the tax subsidies for 401(k)s and other private retirement options. Mr. Miller, who heads the House Education and Labor Committee, calls them "a big failure" and recently held a hearing to ponder alternatives, including nationalizing pensions and replacing them with special bonds administered by Social Security. The proposal has also caught the eye of Jim McDermott, who chairs the relevant Ways and Means subcommittee. Mr. Obama won big with his promise of tax cuts for the middle class, which doesn't square with attacks on middle-class nest eggs. 
-- John Conyers. The man running House Judiciary is cheerleading the Europeans who want to indict Bush officials for war crimes. Other Democrats are thinking about hearings and other show trials. This is far from the postpartisan reconciliation that Mr. Obama preaches. 
-- Henry Waxman. With President Bush soon to be out of office, the Californian's team of Inspector Clouseaus at House Oversight won't have any "scandals" left to pursue. The word in Washington is that Mr. Waxman is looking to unseat John Dingell as Chairman of Energy and Commerce, in order to shove aside a global warming moderate. That could pave the way for huge new energy taxes. Voters will punish Mr. Obama if they get hammered every time they fill up the gas tank or buy groceries. 
-- Pete Stark. The Chairman of a crucial House subcommittee dealing with health care doesn't think Mr. Obama's proposal to significantly federalize the insurance market goes far enough. He wants a single-payer system like Canada's. Mr. Obama may want to strike a deal with Senate Republicans on health care, but Mr. Stark will be pulling him left at every turn. 
All of these feudal lords -- and many others -- also come with their own private armies: the interest groups that compose the money and manpower of today's Democratic Party. The American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch and others on the anti-antiterror left want Mr. Obama to limit the surveillance and other tools that have prevented another terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense will insist on onerous caps -- that is, taxes -- on coal and other carbon energy. Those won't help Mr. Obama carry Ohio and Indiana again in four years. 
The trial bar wants an end to arbitration in disputes in return on its Senate investment, while the National Education Association will try to gut No Child Left Behind accountability standards. And organized labor will insist on a major push to pass "card check," which would end secret-ballot elections for unions. If Mr. Obama wants to mobilize the business community against him while squeezing moderate Democrats, he'll go along with that right from the start. 
While many voters may think they've voted for "change" in Mr. Obama, they also handed power to the oldest forces in the Old Democratic Party. Jimmy Carter campaigned as a moderate and outsider, but Congressional liberals quickly ran his budget director, the economic centrist Bert Lance, out of town. Then they overrode Mr. Carter's veto of a pork-barrel water bill. Mr. Carter referred to the tax committees as "ravenous wolves" after they transformed his tax reform into a special-interest bouquet. Next came Reagan. 
Bill Clinton also campaigned as a moderate, but in his first two years he was unable to govern as Congress pursued liberal priorities, including a big boost in taxes and spending. Recall Roberta Achtenberg as the scourge of the Boy Scouts and Joycelyn Elders calling for the legalization of drugs? Mr. Clinton chose -- or was forced -- to take up gun control and HillaryCare before welfare reform. Next came Newt Gingrich. 
Maybe Mr. Obama has absorbed these lessons, but even if he has he'll have to be tough. The Great Society liberals who dominate Congress are old men in a hurry, and they'll run over the 47-year-old neophyte if he lets them.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
The presidential election occurs at a pivotal moment. Our nation is fighting two wars abroad, suffers from the greatest global financial crisis since the Great Depression, and is facing a painful recession. I believe in the greatness of America. I believe in our capacity to prosper, and to be safer and remain a beacon of light on the global stage. But we cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight: waiting for our luck to change. We have to act immediately. We have to fight for it. 
The institutions that we counted on -- Wall Street banks, our elected leaders in Washington -- failed us. We must reverse the corruption and arrogance that have overtaken these institutions, and we must place our trust in the hands of those who have never let us down, especially the American family and small businesses. 
We need to grow our small businesses, not tax them. I will fight the Democrats' plans to redistribute the fruit of America's labor and turn our economy into a full-fledged disaster. I will cut taxes on families, seniors, savers and businesses. We need to double the child deduction, cut the capital gains tax, and keep jobs in America with a lower business tax. 
I will make government finally live on a budget and enforce that discipline by the power of veto. I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money. I will impose a short-term spending freeze and rid the government of waste, duplication and fraud. And I will chart a different course than the administration and Barack Obama and not spend your money just to bail out Wall Street bankers and brokers. I have a plan to protect the value of homes and get them rising again by refinancing mortgages so your neighbor won't default and further drag down the value of your house. 
I will end three decades of failed energy policies; stop sending $700 billion to countries that oppose American values and finance our enemies; and drill for oil and natural gas. We must strengthen incentives for all energy alternatives -- nuclear, clean coal, wind, solar and tide. We will encourage the manufacture of hybrid, flex fuel and electric automobiles. We will lower the cost of energy, and create millions of new jobs. 
I will not impose "one size fits all" health care on families and small businesses through expensive mandates and fines. I will bring down the skyrocketing cost of health care with competition and choice, reform the insurance market to be fair, and allow you to keep the same health plan if you change jobs or choose to stay home. 
One in five jobs in the U.S. depends on trade and I will fight the threat to those jobs from Democrat plans for isolationism. I won't make it harder to sell our goods overseas and kill more jobs. I will open new markets to goods made in America and make sure our trade is free and fair. And I'll make sure we help workers who've lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away. 
Senator Obama wants to raise taxes and restrict trade. The last time America did that in a bad economy it led to the Great Depression. 
While most Americans are rightly concerned with the economic crisis, a world of pressing national security challenges also awaits the next president. 
The gains our troops have made in the past 18 months in Iraq could be lost if we pull our troops out prematurely and regardless of the conditions on the ground. We have also dealt devastating blows to al Qaeda, especially in Iraq, but terrorists have found sanctuary on the Pakistan frontier among those trying to topple governments in both Kabul and Islamabad. 
Afghanistan is reaching a crisis point, just as Iraq did in 2006. As an early supporter of the surge strategy in Iraq, I know that turning around this situation will require more than just increased troop levels. We also need a new, comprehensive strategy, one that integrates civil and military efforts and engages with various Afghan tribes. 
Other major threats loom on the horizon: the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs; aggressive Russian behavior toward its neighbors; Venezuelan adventurism; genocide in Darfur; and global warming. And those are only the dangers that we know of. Just as few expected the Russians to invade Georgia, we remain unaware of precisely where our next crisis will erupt, or when. The only certainty is that, as Joe Biden guaranteed, the tests facing the next president will be more severe if he is seen as weak in national security leadership. 
I have devoted my life to safeguarding America. Former Secretary of State George Shultz compares diplomacy to tending a garden -- if you want to see relationships flourish, you have to tend them. I have done that, by traveling the world and establishing ties with everyone from dissidents to heads of state. There is great need for American leadership in the world, and I understand that only by exercising that leadership with grace and wisdom can we be successful in safeguarding our interests. 
When I am president, I will not offer up unconditional summit meetings with dangerous dictators, nor will I foreclose diplomatic tools that serve our interests. I will respect our trade agreements with our allies, not unilaterally renounce them. I will close the Guantanamo Bay prison and ban torture. I will expand our armed forces and transform our civil and military agencies to win the struggle against violent Islamic extremism. 
I believe that America is an exceptional country, one that demands exceptional leadership. After the difficulties of the last eight years, Americans are hungry for change and they deserve it. My career has been dedicated to the security and prosperity of America and that of every nation that seeks to live in freedom. It's time to get our country, and our world, back on track. 
Mr. McCain is the Republican nominee for president.

Abstract 
Environmental efforts tend to focus on curbing emissions from the country's oil and gas industry, such as Alberta's C$2 billion fund to develop carbon capture and storage projects.

As global recession fears weigh on new investments and jobs, Ontario is trying to ward off the threat with a major financial boost for renewable energy. 
In March, Canada's most populous province announced a 1.15 billion- Canadian-dollar ($892 million) fund to help develop promising green technologies over the next five years that could eventually backstop Ontario's environmental targets. These technologies aim to lessen the environmental impact of human development, by using renewable sources of energy or cutting pollution from industry and transportation. 
The provincial government is also hoping to create a hub in Ontario for the fledgling renewable-energy industry to rake back jobs lost in the manufacturing sector. "With the world looking for innovative ways to conserve energy and fight global warming, some place is going to secure thousands of jobs by researching and developing new solutions, and we want that place to be Ontario," Dalton McGuinty, Ontario's premier, said this summer. 
Ontario was suffering well before the financial crisis raised the specter of recession and mass layoffs. As a major vehicle producer, the province relies heavily on General Motors Corp., Chrysler LLC and Ford Motor Co. But Detroit's Big Three auto makers have axed 11,270 jobs here since 2005, three-quarters of their total cuts across Canada. Other auto makers and parts suppliers have shed at least another 2,000 jobs. 
In the past five years, more than 230,000 jobs have disappeared from Ontario's manufacturing sector. 
The new Ontario technology fund, dubbed the Next Generation of Jobs Fund, is a small start in trying to reverse this trend. The manufacturing job losses will dwarf any potential gains. But, as frozen credit markets complicate financing efforts even for large, established companies, the fund could be a crucial backer for the small firms driving new developments in renewable energy. 
Companies like 6N Silicon Inc., which won the fund's second grant of just under C$8 million in July, have already benefited. Using a process developed by its founder in his basement, 6N Silicon purifies low-grade silicon to a quality that can be used in commercial photovoltaic cells. After two years of lab and pilot tests, the company is ready for production and to start capitalizing on the boom in solar energy. 
The grant has been a "huge boost" for 6N Silicon, not least because the company would likely have struggled to get bank loans, said David Dunnison, its vice president for business development. 
"There's definitely strength for us that we've had that kind of endorsement and that kind of monetary help," he said. "We've been fortunate in the investment interest we've experienced . . . but with a government fund, it makes us a safer investment and a more attractive investment." 
The company has opened its head office and a 2,000-metric-ton-a-year production plant in Vaughan, Ontario, and plans to grow rapidly. Many of its 84 new employees were auto workers. 
By helping promising technologies go commercial, the fund fits neatly with Ontario's existing renewable initiatives. Like other Canadian provinces, Ontario has agreed to buy renewable power at higher rates than for electricity from fossil fuels, reflecting the higher generation costs. Several U.S. states, mostly in the Northeast, have done the same as concerns about climate change concerns meet still-high fossil fuel prices. 
Ontario, for example, guarantees 11 Canadian cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity from renewable sources -- double the amount from coal and natural gas -- while electricity from solar gets 42 cents a kilowatt-hour. 
But a sense of urgency has rarely accompanied renewable initiatives in Canada, largely thanks to the country's abundant natural resources. Environmental efforts tend to focus on curbing emissions from the country's oil and gas industry, such as Alberta's C$2 billion fund to develop carbon capture and storage projects. The as-yet unproved technology aims to capture carbon dioxide from industrial emissions and sequester it underground, usually by injecting it into maturing oil and gas wells. 
Moreover, hydroelectric power is usually included in renewable targets, as is the case with Ontario's goal to generate 43% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. 
The provincial power authority is currently looking at toughening up this target to see "whether it's solid enough, not whether it's too solid," said George Nutter, spokesman for Ontario's energy and infrastructure ministry. 
The technology fund is open to sectors other than the renewable industry, notably biopharmaceuticals and information technology. There are no quotas for each industry, so renewable initiatives may end up receiving a small chunk of the total funds. The differences between the industries will also make it difficult to estimate the potential for new jobs. 
By stumping up 15% to 20% of the total investment, the fund could attract another C$7 billion "at least," reckons Fernando Traficante, director of the fund's secretariat. 
"And I suspect the money will run out" before the fund's five years are up, he said. "If we can prove success, then hopefully we'll get more money" from the Ontario government. 
The manufacturing sector's woes have been compounded by the financial crisis. Canada's banking sector is based in Toronto, and the province is now staring at its first budget shortfall in four years. Ontario expects a C$500 million deficit in the current fiscal year, and has refused to make any further budget projections. 
Another big unknown is what sort of impact the credit crunch will have. Mr. Traficante sees one of two scenarios: either companies pull back on all investments, spooked by recession fears; or they invest to put themselves in a leading position when the economy improves in a few years' time. 
"There are some companies, perhaps fewer than yesterday, that still take that latter view," Mr. Traficante said.

Abstract 
Mr. Obama would also double fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks; mandate that all new vehicles are flex-fuel, which means able to run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol; require that all new buildings are carbon-neutral by 2030, in addition to multiple other efficiency rules to discourage energy consumption; and detail a 10-year, $150 billion project of government-directed research into alternative energy technologies. -- While Mr. McCain was skeptical of drilling in his 2000 presidential bid, he currently favors expanding domestic offshore energy exploration, and he'd give states a share of the leasing royalties if they permitted drilling off their coasts. 

Full Text 
Discounting election-year hyperbole, Barack Obama and John McCain are broadly like-minded in their approach to energy and the environment. Though important policy differences exist, both support "energy independence" and a large-scale reorganization of the U.S. economy in the name of climate change. The candidates, in other words, come in different shades of green. 
-- Global warming. Both Messrs. McCain and Obama support the taxation and regulation of greenhouse gases, which is also a top priority of congressional Democrats. A "cap and trade" program would set an economy-wide limit on emissions that declines every year. Businesses would then buy and sell permits that stand for the right to emit these gases, and pass the costs down through the energy chain to consumers. Mr. McCain, who joined with Joe Lieberman in 2003 to introduce Congress's first climate bill, wants to reduce U.S. emissions to 60% below 1990 levels by 2050. Mr. Obama would shoot for 80%. 
-- Cap and trade. Mr. McCain's cap-and-trade stance is more market friendly: He would allow its built-in incentives to motivate the investments and behavioral changes necessary for a postcarbon economy. Mr. McCain would also include offsets, which allow businesses to meet their emissions targets by paying someone else to reduce carbon usage. Offsets would reduce the overall burden of a carbon program but would also result in fewer real emission cuts. 
Mr. Obama is stricter, overlaying his cap-and-trade agenda with an array of federal mandates, regulations and subsidies. He would increase the ethanol and biofuel production requirement to 60 billion gallons a year by 2030 -- 67% higher than the current goal. Mr. Obama would also double fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks; mandate that all new vehicles are flex-fuel, which means able to run on any blend of gasoline and ethanol; require that all new buildings are carbon-neutral by 2030, in addition to multiple other efficiency rules to discourage energy consumption; and detail a 10-year, $150 billion project of government-directed research into alternative energy technologies. 
-- Carbon auctions. Another important difference is that Mr. Obama would auction off all carbon permits on the "polluter pays" principle. Mr. McCain would initially give away the permits to utilities and other industries while introducing auctions over time. The Obama approach is more efficient. Once the permits are waved into existence, they immediately have dollar value; the question is who benefits. Auctions would also raise trillions of dollars that could be used to offset the economic drag of a carbon crackdown. 
However, Congress is unlikely to devote its windfall to cutting taxes elsewhere, such as on labor and capital. Instead, the money will likely to go to political patronage, such as Mr. Obama's "green-collar jobs" program, or to compensate states in the South and Midwest that rely more heavily on carbon energy and would be hit especially hard by cap and trade. 
-- Nuclear power and electricity. Mr. McCain wants to expand America's fleet of nuclear power plants, which emit no greenhouse gases, and he promises to fast-track and build some 45 by 2030. Mr. Obama hasn't ruled out expanding nuclear power, but he says safety and waste storage concerns must be resolved before moving forward. 
Mr. Obama would impose a "renewable portfolio standard" that utilities generate at least 25% of their power by 2025 from noncarbon sources such as wind and solar, which are currently marginal parts of the energy mix. He promises to invest in smart metering, distributed storage and eventually a national electricity grid. Mr. McCain says he'll modernize the grid too. 
-- Coal. The Democrat is especially hostile to conventional coal plants, which today supply nearly 50% of U.S. electricity, and Joe Biden has said publicly the U.S. should build no more coal plants. Mr. Obama does claim to support "clean coal," as does Mr. McCain. However, this technology to capture carbon and bury it underground is far from commercial deployment, and it is unclear if even new funding is enough to overcome its practical limitations. 
-- Fossil fuels. Despite the green aspirations of the candidates, the U.S. economy will continue to depend on oil, natural gas and coal for decades, though obviously their prices will rise substantially if carbon is taxed. While Mr. McCain was skeptical of drilling in his 2000 presidential bid, he currently favors expanding domestic offshore energy exploration, and he'd give states a share of the leasing royalties if they permitted drilling off their coasts. The Outer Continental Shelf is estimated to contain 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
Mr. Obama initially opposed all new drilling but reversed himself in August. He now says he could support a limited expansion as long as it is part of a larger energy package. Mr. Obama has also called for a windfall profits tax on the American oil majors. 
Pressured by the GOP's "drill, baby, drill" offensive, Democrats allowed the offshore moratorium to lapse earlier this fall, and they plan to reinstate it next year if Mr. Obama wins. That move would be far more difficult politically if Mr. McCain wins. A McCain Interior Department could significantly expand domestic oil-and-gas production, depending on its willingness to confront the environmental lobby.

Obama's Carbon Ultimatum

Abstract 
Coal-fired power and other fossil fuels would be ruled out of existence, while all other prices would rise as the huge economic costs of the new regime were passed down the energy chain to consumers. 

Full Text 
Liberals pretend that only President Bush is preventing the U.S. from adopting some global warming "solution." But occasionally their mask slips. As Barack Obama's energy adviser has now made clear, the would-be President intends to blackmail -- or rather, greenmail -- Congress into falling in line with his climate agenda. 
Jason Grumet is currently executive director of an outfit called the National Commission on Energy Policy and one of Mr. Obama's key policy aides. In an interview last week with Bloomberg, Mr. Grumet said that come January the Environmental Protection Agency "would initiate those rulemakings" that classify carbon as a dangerous pollutant under current clean air laws. That move would impose new regulation and taxes across the entire economy, something that is usually the purview of Congress. Mr. Grumet warned that "in the absence of Congressional action" 18 months after Mr. Obama's inauguration, the EPA would move ahead with its own unilateral carbon crackdown anyway. 
Well, well. For years, Democrats -- including Senator Obama -- have been howling about the "politicization" of the EPA, which has nominally been part of the Bush Administration. The complaint has been that the White House blocked EPA bureaucrats from making the so-called "endangerment finding" on carbon. Now it turns out that a President Obama would himself wield such a finding as a political bludgeon. He plans to issue an ultimatum to Congress: Either impose new taxes and limits on carbon that he finds amenable, or the EPA carbon police will be let loose to ravage the countryside. 
The EPA hasn't made a secret of how it would like to centrally plan the U.S. economy under the 1970 Clean Air Act. In a blueprint released in July, the agency didn't exactly say it'd collectivize the farms -- but pretty close, down to the "grass clippings." The EPA would monitor and regulate the carbon emissions of "lawn and garden equipment" as well as everything with an engine, like cars, planes and boats. Eco- bureaucrats envision thousands of other emissions limits on all types of energy. Coal-fired power and other fossil fuels would be ruled out of existence, while all other prices would rise as the huge economic costs of the new regime were passed down the energy chain to consumers. 
These costs would far exceed the burden of a straight carbon tax or cap-and-trade system enacted by Congress, because the Clean Air Act was never written to apply to carbon and other greenhouse gases. It's like trying to do brain surgery with a butter knife. Mr. Obama wants to move ahead anyway because he knows that the costs of any carbon program will be high. He knows, too, that Congress -- even with strongly Democratic majorities -- might still balk at supporting tax increases on their constituents, even if it is done in the name of global warming. 
Climate-change politics don't break cleanly along partisan lines. The burden of a carbon clampdown will fall disproportionately on some states over others, especially the 25 interior states that get more than 50% of their electricity from coal. Rustbelt manufacturing states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania will get hit hard too. Once President Bush leaves office, the coastal Democrats pushing hardest for a climate change program might find their colleagues splitting off, especially after they vote for a huge tax increase on incomes. 
Thus Messrs. Obama and Grumet want to invoke a political deus ex machina driven by a faulty interpretation of the Clean Air Act to force Congress's hand. Mr. Obama and Democrats can then tell Americans that Congress must act to tax and regulate carbon to save the country from even worse bureaucratic consequences. It's Mr. Obama's version of Jack Benny's old "your money or your life" routine, but without the punch line. 
The strategy is most notable for what it says about the climate- change lobby and its new standard bearer. Supposedly global warming is the transcendent challenge of the age, but Mr. Obama evidently doesn't believe he'll be able to convince his own party to do something about it without a bureaucratic ultimatum. Mr. Grumet justified it this way: "The 
U.S. has to move quickly domestically . . . We cannot have a meaningful impact in the international discussion until we develop a meaningful domestic consensus." 
Normally a democracy reaches consensus through political debate and persuasion, but apparently for Mr. Obama that option is merely a nuisance. It's another example of "change" you'll be given no choice but to believe in.

Abstract 
Sen. Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, told a voter while walking a rope line in Pennsylvania that "we are not supporting clean coal," comments that were videotaped, likely without him realizing it. Clean-coal technology -- a still-theoretical process in which the dirty fuel is rendered cleaner by trapping carbon emissions -- holds the promise of keeping miners employed in the age of carbon restrictions and global warming. 

Full Text 
In their debates and national ads, John McCain and Barack Obama focus on the financial crisis, health care and war. In battleground states, the campaigns have started veering into the weeds, as both men seek to gain advantage with local issues that matter intensely to voters only in those regions. 
In the toss-up state of Colorado, the 1922 Colorado River Water Compact has roiled the race. In mid-August, Sen. McCain told a reporter from Colorado's Pueblo Chieftain newspaper that the compact -- which dictates how much of the river's flow can be claimed by seven Western states -- "obviously needs to be renegotiated over time." That suggestion angers many in the state who fear they might lose under new terms to thirsty downstream states such as the Republican candidate's home state of Arizona. 
The local response was swift. "We don't vote for water rustlers in this state; we tar and feather them!" Denver Post deputy editorial page editor Bob Ewegen wrote in a column. Republican senate candidate Bob Schaffer distanced himself from his standard-bearer, declaring the compact would be changed "over my cold, dead, political carcass." 
Josh Earnest, who leads the local communications efforts of Obama's national campaign, says he had no idea what the compact was when Sen. McCain raised it. "But our supporters in Colorado were very aware of the importance," he said. Sen. Obama was soon accusing his rival of wanting to "monkey around with the water." On Sept. 30, the campaign began highlighting the statement in Colorado-only radio ads. 
Back in Pueblo this month, a chastened Sen. McCain backtracked, saying he would "never, ever seek a renegotiation of the Colorado River Compact." McCain campaign officials concede the initial statement was damaging. Though not speaking directly about the water issue, Jeff Sadosky, the campaign's regional media director, noted that local concerns carry peril for candidates. "Where you get killed on local issues is when you bungle or you equivocate," he said. 
Sen. McCain turned the tables in Appalachia in late September. Sen. Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, told a voter while walking a rope line in Pennsylvania that "we are not supporting clean coal," comments that were videotaped, likely without him realizing it. "No coal plants here in America," he said. 
Clean-coal technology -- a still-theoretical process in which the dirty fuel is rendered cleaner by trapping carbon emissions -- holds the promise of keeping miners employed in the age of carbon restrictions and global warming. Sen. Biden's comments made news almost from the instant the McCain campaign discovered them on the Internet. Within an hour, the Republican ticket formed the Coalition to Protect Coal Jobs, made up of Republican politicians from Pennsylvania, Ohio and other coal states. 
A few hours later, the Obama campaign, pleading that it had been misunderstood, rolled out the Clean Coal Jobs Task Force, made up of Democratic politicians from many of the same states. 
"Four days of stories -- that's what we got," said Mr. Sadosky, who found the Biden video on a local blog. 
So it has gone in a host of battleground states. In Nevada, Sen. Obama highlighted in television ads Sen. McCain's longtime support of the proposed -- and locally reviled -­Yucca Mountain nuclear storage site. After the spots began running over the summer, Sen. McCain's support began dropping. A mid-August poll by the Las Vegas Review-Journal found that 60% of Nevadans said the candidates' stances on Yucca would bear on their vote. 
In Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio, Sen. Obama has exploited a locally popular agreement, the Great Lakes water compact. Sen. Obama proposed a measure to sweeten the interstate compact, which prevents the lakes from being drained away by diversion projects, with $5 billion in federal cash to restore the lakes. The result: positive news stories in cities such as Milwaukee, Cleveland and Minneapolis -- and notice that Sen. McCain doesn't support the Obama proposal. 
Indeed, the scrap for local votes often favors Sen. Obama because Sen. McCain has built a career out of opposing federal pork that drives many beloved projects. That was driven home in Virginia, where Republican politicians are pleading with Sen. McCain to reconsider his opposition to a $1.5 billion federal subsidy for a subway-extension project. The project is popular locally and supported by Sen. Obama. 
Sen. Obama also benefits from investing a fair amount of power in local staff members. After Hurricane Gustav chewed through rural Cuba in early September, Mark Bubriski, an Obama campaign operative in Florida, spotted a small news item. Several Miami-based Cuban groups began pressing President George W. Bush to relax temporarily restrictions on remittances from Cubans living in the U.S. to relatives back home, so the island could be rebuilt more quickly. 
Sen. McCain and the Bush administration resisted the call. Sen. Obama had already urged a relaxation of the policy in the spring. 
Mr. Bubriski saw a recycling opportunity. "We pushed Chicago to put out a statement immediately, even though it was just a reiteration of policy," he said. Within a day, the Obama camp issued a statement in Spanish and English, which Florida reporters recorded -- along with Sen. McCain's opposition. 
Sen. McCain's edge among Latino voters soon dropped sharply in polls, and once-safe Florida became a toss-up. "Obviously, it goes back to the old maxim that all politics is local," Mr. Earnest said.

Abstract 
An analysis by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of the leading Senate proposal to cut emissions found that gross domestic product would grow 80% from 2010 to 2030 if the bill became law, only one percentage point less than its growth in the absence of the bill.

The global financial crisis is threatening efforts in the U.S. and Europe to fight climate change. 
In Europe, industries and some national governments are pushing back against the European Union's goal of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 20% by 2020, arguing that the midst of an economic crisis isn't the time for costly new taxes on fossil-fuel consumption. 
"Does it make sense to ask companies for such a large sacrifice, and risk hitting citizens' pockets at such a delicate moment, all for environmental policy whose efficacy is questionable?" Italian Environment Minister Stefania Prestigiacomo said through a spokesperson. 
In the U.S., both major-party presidential candidates and Democratic congressional leaders have promised to pursue climate-change legislation as a top priority next year. 
But within the Democratic Party, which is expected to gain congressional seats in the Nov. 4 election, splits are emerging between lawmakers from coastal states and those from Rust Belt and coal-friendly regions. They differ over how much time companies should be given to slash emissions and what authority states should have to set their own limits on greenhouse gases, so named because they trap the sun's heat in the earth's atmosphere. 
"In times of economic downturns, members [of Congress] are extremely reluctant to add burdens to the economy, and we're going to confront that problem," says Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Michigan Democrat recently introduced a proposal to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 6% by 2020. Environmental groups want cuts of 20%-25% during that period. 
A bill to establish an economywide cap-and-trade system for the U.S. aimed at cutting greenhouse-gas emissions roughly 66% by 2050 failed in the Senate this year. Though oil prices have fallen 40% since the Senate debate, energy costs continue to rank high among voters' concerns. Last week, the U.S. government's top energy forecaster said Americans can expect to pay as much as 15% more to heat their homes this winter. 
The financial crisis could also upset international negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty that requires many industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. 
"If industry is in a difficult pass, most sensible governments will be reluctant to impose new costs on them in the form of carbon- emissions caps," said Yvo de Boer, director of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The final shot at getting a deal will come in 2009. 
Business groups on both continents are pouncing on the economic turmoil as they lobby against planned new regulations. Airlines, citing slow growth rates and high fuel costs, are seeking to soften some aspects of Europe's plan to require air carriers to join its cap- and-trade system for carbon-dioxide emissions after 2012. 
Europe's auto makers are seeking to delay by three years the continent's planned introduction of mandatory carbon-dioxide emissions controls on new cars. 
"The pushback is stronger than before," said John Ashton, the U.K.'s special representative for climate change. Europe will still be able to hammer out an agreement, Mr. Ashton said. "We'll have to fight harder to keep it together." 
Estimates of the cost of economywide caps on greenhouse-gas emissions vary. An analysis by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of the leading Senate proposal to cut emissions found that gross domestic product would grow 80% from 2010 to 2030 if the bill became law, only one percentage point less than its growth in the absence of the bill. But the EPA also projected electricity prices could increase 44% by 2030 under the proposal. Supporters of carbon caps say inaction will impose costs in the form of coastal flooding and other damage. 
Major U.S. power companies in coal-abundant states are warning of higher electricity prices if they are forced to cut emissions before perfecting technology to capture and store their plants' carbon emissions. 
"We know something needs to be done [to cut emissions], but we've got to get the economy on its feet before we do something economically irrational," said Mike Morris, chief executive of American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Morris and other executives fear lawmakers will use revenue from pollution permits to pay down the federal deficit. 
"The likelihood that they would try to take these revenues for other purposes, particularly in an economic downturn, is great," says James Rogers, chief executive of North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp.

WASHINGTON -- Encouraging greater production of transportation fuel made from liquefied coal and Canadian oil sands could help reduce oil prices but also undermine U.S. efforts to fight global warming, according to a report to be released Wednesday by the Rand Corp. 
The study by Rand, a nonprofit research institute in Santa Monica, Calif., illustrates the tensions between fighting global warming and reducing U.S. dependence on Middle East oil. It buttresses some criticisms leveled by environmental groups that certain alternative sources of fossil fuel result in higher levels of carbon-dioxide emissions than conventional motor fuel, when all of their emissions -- from production through development and consumption -- are measured. 
The study's authors note that carbon-dioxide emissions from the production and use of oil sands are roughly 20% higher than conventional petroleum, and that emissions from the production and use of liquid fuel from coal are about twice the emissions of conventional fuels. At the same time, the authors say, greater production of fuel from oil sands and liquid coal could help expand global fuel supplies and work to slow the rise in oil prices. 
Tax legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush last week contains a provision that makes alternative jet fuel made from liquefied coal eligible for the first time for a 50-cents-a-gallon tax credit. 
A spokesman for the National Mining Association, Corey Henry, acknowledged that fuel made from liquefied coal produces high carbon- dioxide emissions, but said delaying production of it would exacerbate U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

Abstract 
Given typical driving distances and fuel- economy numbers, that translates into about five tons of carbon dioxide per car per year. 

Full Text 
A new concept is entering the consumer lexicon: the carbon footprint. 
First came organic. Then came fair trade. Now makers of everything from milk to jackets to cars are starting to tally up the carbon footprints of their products. That's the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that get coughed into the air when the goods are made, shipped and stored, and then used by consumers. 
So far, these efforts raise as many questions as they answer. Different companies are counting their products' carbon footprints differently, making it all but impossible for shoppers to compare goods. And even if consumers come to understand the numbers, they might not like what they find out. 
For instance, many products' global-warming impact depends less on how they're made than on how they're used. That means the easiest way to cut carbon emissions may be to buy less of a product or use it in a way that's less convenient. 
So, what are the carbon footprints of some of the common products we use? How are they calculated? And what surprises do they hold? What follows is a look at six everyday items -- cars, shoes, laundry detergent, clothing, milk and beer -- and the numbers that go with them. 
But first, here's a number that will help you put all those carbon footprints in perspective. The U.S. emits the equivalent of about 118 pounds of carbon dioxide per resident every day, a figure that includes emissions from industry. Annually, that's nearly 20 metric tons per American -- about five times the number per citizen of the world at large, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Now, let's take a closer look at those six products. 
CARS 
The simplest statistic in the carbon-footprinting game may be this: For every mile it travels, the average car in the U.S. emits about one pound of carbon dioxide. Given typical driving distances and fuel- economy numbers, that translates into about five tons of carbon dioxide per car per year. 
A study by the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems found that, over its expected 120,000-mile life, an American- made midsize sedan emits the equivalent of about 63 tons of carbon dioxide. That number includes all emissions, from the making of the car's raw materials, such as steel and plastic, through the shredding of the car once it's junked. 
The vast majority of those emissions -- 86% -- came from the car's fuel use, the study found. Just 4% of emissions came from making and assembling the car. That means consumers can lower their footprint by buying a car with better fuel economy. 
Sometimes, the differences between models can be substantial. For one overview of how cars stack up, consider a new computer model paid for by Toyota Motor Corp. that computes the lifetime carbon footprints of about 400 auto models from multiple manufacturers. 
To narrow things down, consider a handful of Toyota's own models. The Prius, a hybrid gasoline-and-electric car that averages 42 miles per gallon, has a lifetime carbon footprint of 44 metric tons, according to the updated computer model done for Toyota by Kreider & Associates, a consultant based in Boulder, Colo. The Corolla, a small sedan with a conventional gasoline engine rated at 29 miles per gallon, has a footprint of 64 tons. The Camry, a larger car rated at 23 miles per gallon, has a footprint of 95 tons. And the 4Runner, an SUV rated at 16 miles per gallon, has a footprint of 118 tons. 
Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Michigan center, says he used to advise people that the best way to minimize the carbon footprint of their driving was to keep their car as long as possible, since junking a car and manufacturing a new one produces pollution. But that was before hybrids hit the market and offered markedly better fuel economy. Now, he says, scrapping an old car in favor of a new model makes lots of sense. 
The introduction of the hybrid "changes the whole dynamic," Mr. Keoleian says. "Then, you replace." 
SHOES 
You may think you're at one with nature going for a walk in the woods in your sturdy hiking boots. But those boots pack a lot of carbon. The big reason: the leather. 
Timberland Co., a Stratham, N.H., shoe company with an outdoorsy image, has assessed the carbon footprint of about 40 of the shoe models it currently sells. The results range from about 22 pounds to 220 pounds per pair. Each of the shoes that has been carbon- footprinted comes with a label assessing its greenhouse-gas score on a scale of zero, which is best, to 10, which is worst. 
Flip-flops tend to have footprints of 22 pounds to 44 pounds, says Pete Girard, senior analyst for environmental stewardship at Timberland. Shoes typically range from 66 pounds to 132 pounds. Hiking boots typically pack between 154 and 198 pounds, Mr. Girard says. 
Though Timberland produces many of its shoes in Asia and sells them in the U.S., it has found that transportation typically accounts for less than 5% of the carbon footprint. By far the biggest contributor is the shoe's raw material. "For most Timberland shoes," says Betsy Blaisdell, Timberland's manager for environmental stewardship, "leather really drives the score." 
The average dairy cow produces, every year, an amount of greenhouse gas equivalent to four tons of carbon dioxide, according to U.S. government figures. Most of that comes not from carbon dioxide, in fact, but from a more-potent greenhouse gas: methane. 
The cow's impact on the atmosphere is due largely to a process known scientifically as "enteric fermentation" -- and colloquially as burping. A cow's multiple stomachs make it particularly efficient at transforming feed into bovine products: meat, milk and hide. But all that churning also produces lots of methane -- a greenhouse gas that, pound for pound, is 25 times as damaging to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, according to the United Nations. Converting those methane emissions into a carbon-dioxide-equivalent number is one step in calculating the cow's carbon footprint. 
Take Timberland's Winter Park Slip On Boot. They're casual boots -- not as heavy as hiking boots -- but their uppers are all leather. Their footprint sits in the middle of the Timberland range, at 121 pounds per pair. Of that total, 8.5 pounds comes from the electricity used to make the boots at Timberland's factory in China's Guangdong Province. The remaining 112.5 pounds comes from the raw materials used to make the shoe: rubber for the outsole; ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA, for the midsole; and, most of all, leather for the upper. 
To come up with these numbers, Timberland first gets data from the factory on the amount of electricity the factory uses in a given period. Dividing that by the number of shoes the factory produces in that period yields a per-shoe energy-consumption figure. 
Timberland then checks those figures against tables that list average carbon-dioxide emissions per unit of energy produced. The tables are tailored to the specific power-plant fuel mix in the area where the factory sits. In China, which makes much of its power by burning coal, the carbon hit is greater than in, say, France, which makes most of its electricity with nuclear power. 
The harder part for Timberland is figuring out the emissions that come from the part of the process it doesn't control: the production of the raw materials before they get to the Timberland factory. Timberland gets that information from the databases of "life-cycle analysis" consultants, who put together tables showing the environmental impacts of producing given amounts of various materials, from rubber to polyester to leather. 
Timberland's carbon-footprint calculations have prompted spats with some of Timberland's leather suppliers, Ms. Blaisdell says. They argue the carbon hit from a cow should fall not on their ledger, but on the ledger of beef producers. The leather producers reason that cows are grown mainly for meat, with leather as a byproduct, so that growing leather doesn't yield any emissions beyond those that would have occurred anyway. 
But Timberland has determined that 7% of the financial value of a cow lies in its leather. And life-cycle-analysis guidelines used by Timberland say the company should apply that percentage to compute the share of a cow's total emissions attributable to the leather. "We've had a lot of battles with our leather suppliers over this," Ms. Blaisdell says. Timberland officials, she says, "just follow the guidelines." 
Timberland officials concede shortcomings with their method. By using an average energy-consumption number for all pairs of shoes, the calculations fail to recognize that some shoes require more electricity to assemble in the factory than do others. And Timberland's calculations omit the carbon impact of the leather and other materials that fall to the cutting-room floor. 
"No question, it's crude in some ways," Mr. Girard says. "But it's a step more information than our designers were making a decision on before." 
LAUNDRY DETERGENT 
The recipe for a low-carbon load of laundry: Use liquid detergent instead of powder, wash your clothes in cool water and hang them out to dry. 
That's the message shoppers get when they walk down the detergent aisles at Tesco PLC stores in the U.K. Starting this spring, the retailer began slapping footprint-shaped carbon labels on Tesco-brand laundry detergent. Along with the carbon-footprint number, the label offers tips about lowering the score. 
The carbon footprint of a load of laundry done with Tesco detergent varies from 1.3 pounds to 1.9 pounds, depending on what form of detergent is used, the labels report. According to Procter & Gamble Co., the average American family does about 300 loads of laundry per year, or about six loads per week. That suggests a per-family carbon footprint from doing laundry of about 480 pounds per year, or about 10 pounds per week. And that doesn't include running the dryer. 
Solid capsules of detergent have the highest carbon footprint, according to Tesco. Powder has a slightly lower footprint; liquid has a lower one still; and concentrated liquid has the lowest of all. That's because making solid detergent uses more energy than making the liquid variety. 
But consumers who care about their carbon emissions should do more than switch detergent forms, the labels advise. Doing the wash in cooler water -- 86 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 104 degrees -- will shave the carbon footprint of each load by 0.3 pounds. That's as much of a reduction as you get from switching to liquid from powder. 
The biggest way to cut the environmental impact of cleaning clothes, however, is to stop using a clothes dryer. Drying laundry outside on a line, Tesco says, will cut the carbon footprint of every load by a whopping 4.4 pounds. 
Along with detergent, Tesco labels store-brand orange juice, light bulbs and potatoes. To trace the carbon footprints, Tesco uses data from its suppliers and information from life-cycle-analysis databases. The retailer is labeling products from its own brands first because those were the ones it could most easily control. But Tesco is considering labeling other brands, as well as expanding the effort to its U.S. stores, which operate under the Fresh & Easy name. 
The suppliers that make the labeled products "don't see a risk" in publicizing information about the environmental impacts of their products, says Katherine Symonds, Tesco's sustainability manager. For one thing, all forms of the detergent come from the same suppliers, so those suppliers wouldn't necessarily be hurt if consumers shifted from one form to another. 
Ms. Symonds adds that Tesco carefully picked for its initial labels products whose carbon footprints likely wouldn't shock consumers. The retailer purposely avoided labeling the carbon footprint of beef, for instance, because beef's carbon footprint is significantly higher than that of many other foods. 
If Tesco had presented consumers "with a message that was so counterintuitive and difficult," Ms. Symonds says, "we might have found it difficult to take carbon labeling forward." 
JACKETS 
Patagonia Inc.'s Talus jacket looks like a naturalist's dream. In fact, its carbon footprint is 66 pounds. That, Patagonia notes on its Web site, is 48 times the weight of the jacket itself. 
Over the past year, the Ventura, Calif., outdoor-equipment maker has computed and posted on its Web site the carbon footprints of 15 of its products. Because most of Patagonia's products are made in Asia or Latin America and sold in the U.S., the company expected that a big chunk of the carbon footprints came from transportation. It was wrong. 
The fabric for the Talus is made in China, the zippers come from Japan, and the jacket is sewn in Vietnam. Yet all that transportation adds up to less than 1% of the product's total carbon footprint, Patagonia says. The majority of the footprint -- 71%, or about 47 pounds -- comes in producing the polyester, which originates with oil. 
"If we had listened to the rhetoric out there at the time, which was all around miles, we could have spent years rearranging our supply chain to reduce transportation, when really that's not the bulk of our concern," says Jill Dumain, Patagonia's director for environmental analysis. "There's a lot of reasons to have a tight supply chain, but environmentalism isn't one of them." 
One way to slash the Talus jacket's carbon footprint would be to make it with recycled, rather than virgin, polyester. But when the jacket was being developed, the company that makes the fabric, Polartec LLC, of Lawrence, Mass., couldn't find the right kind of recycled yarn in Asia, says Nate Simmons, director of marketing for the fabric maker. 
Polyester yarn with recycled content is more widely available in the U.S. than in Asia, he says, and Polartec uses it to make some fabric for Patagonia. But the Talus is a particularly complicated jacket, because its material fuses together a weather-resistent outer layer with a warm inner layer. 
At the time the Talus was being developed, using recycled material would have required either making the fabric in the U.S. or shipping U.S.-made recycled-content yarn to Asia to be made into fabric. "It would have been extremely expensive," Mr. Simmons says. "Probably very few people would have bought it. And it wouldn't have had much of a positive impact because of that." 
The bottom line: In making the Talus, Patagonia decided that cost concerns outweighed environmental concerns. "Consumers are starting to put environmental values into their purchasing decisions, but it doesn't always translate into their being willing to pay a higher price," Patagonia's Ms. Dumain says. 
Some Patagonia products -- generally ones whose fabric isn't as complex as the Talus's -- are made with recycled-content fabric. Among them is the Eco Rain Shell, which has a carbon footprint of just 15 pounds, Patagonia says. But the Eco Shell has a different environmental problem: A byproduct of manufacturing the material that makes the jacket water-repellent is perfluorooctanic acid, a substance that Patagonia says has been found accumulating in humans and animals and that scientists say could pose health risks. 
Patagonia lays out this conundrum on its Web site, saying it "reflects the complexities involved" in balancing concern for the environment with the need for performance. 
MILK 
Several studies of milk's carbon footprint are under way in the U.S. Each has come up with a different number, largely because each is counting things differently. 
A recent study by National Dairy Holdings, a Dallas-based dairy, found that the carbon footprint of a gallon of its milk in a plastic jug is either 6.19 pounds or 7.59 pounds. The difference rests in what kind of cases the jugs are placed in during transport from the milk- processing plant to the distribution center. Plastic cases, because they take more energy to produce, yield more carbon-dioxide emissions than do cardboard ones. 
But National Dairy Holdings' study doesn't count all the emissions created by a gallon of milk. It includes those from the cows themselves (more than half of the total), from the processing of the milk and from the transport of the milk to a distribution center. It doesn't count the emissions earlier in the process: growing the cows' feed. Nor does it count the emissions later in the process: transporting the milk from the distribution center to the store and refrigerating it there. 
That's because National Dairy Holdings did its study largely at the request of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a big customer, which is trying to prod environmental improvements in its supply chain. So, National Dairy Holdings measured only its piece in the supply chain, explains Howard Depoy, the dairy's director of power, refrigeration and sustainability. That's "the CO2 that we can control and manage," Mr. Depoy says. 
Aurora Dairy Corp.'s Aurora Organic Dairy, a small organic-milk producer based in Boulder, Colo., is finishing a more-complete study of the carbon footprint of its milk. Its study, done by researchers at the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems, attempts to include emissions all the way from growing the cattle feed to refrigerating the processed milk in the store. The preliminary findings are that producing a half-gallon of Aurora's milk generates the equivalent of 7.2 pounds of carbon dioxide. That's essentially the same amount as the National Dairy Holdings study concluded is produced by an entire gallon of National Dairy Holdings' milk. But the National Dairy Holdings study left out much of the process that the Aurora study included. 
Both studies found that the single biggest chunk of emissions from milk production comes from all that action in the cow's gut. Now, the U.S. dairy industry's main trade group, Dairy Management Inc., is launching yet another study of milk's carbon footprint. It plans a complete measurement akin to Aurora Organic Dairy's. 
The dairy industry doesn't plan to put carbon-footprint labels on milk cartons, says Rick Naczi, an executive vice president for Dairy Management. "It's something that would be very, very difficult to make understandable to consumers," he says. 
BEER 
When New Belgium Brewing Co. set out last year to compute the carbon footprint of a six-pack of its Fat Tire Amber Ale, it figured it would find transportation was the biggest problem. That's the emission source New Belgium thinks about most often. The microbrewer, based in Fort Collins, Colo., has been expanding into more states, necessitating more trucking of its beer. 
When the numbers came in this summer, they showed that a six-pack's carbon footprint was about seven pounds. The real surprise was where the bulk of that number came from: the refrigeration of the beer at stores. Transportation came in fourth, behind manufacturing the glass bottles and producing the barley and malt. "It seems that in every [carbon-footprint study] I've come across, people are surprised," says Jennifer Orgolini, New Belgium's sustainability director. 
Now, New Belgium is considering switching to bottles with more recycled glass, because making them consumes less fuel. It's also considering buying barley and malt produced organically, rather than with chemical fertilizers, which are big emitters. 
Refrigeration poses a tougher problem. Stores selling Fat Tire aren't owned by New Belgium, so even if the brewer wanted them to stop refrigerating the beer, they might not do so. 
There are smaller potential fixes. Many stores could switch from less-efficient, open-front beer chillers to more-efficient models enclosed by clear doors. But that presents its own hurdle, Ms. Orgolini notes: "People don't want to have to open the door."

Abstract 
[...] the Massachusetts Democrat, a strong environmentalist, raised concerns Thursday with tax provisions in the Senate bill promoting wider use of coal and other fossil fuels, congressional aides said. Environmental groups lobbied lawmakers to strip the coal provisions from the bill, even as they were fighting to preserve measures promoting development of renewable power, such as wind and solar energy. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- President George W. Bush's plan to rescue financial markets appeared to gather momentum in the House of Representatives as leaders of both parties stepped up efforts to corral support after the initiative's strong bipartisan showing in the Senate. 
Few in House leadership were willing to predict passage when the bill comes to the floor, likely Friday. Its defeat earlier this week revealed deep skepticism among rank-and-file lawmakers toward the $700 billion package, which Mr. Bush insisted Thursday is needed to begin "restoring confidence" in the shaky U.S. economy. 
Congressional leaders suggested lawmakers appear more receptive to the rescue package now, especially after witnessing the free-fall in financial markets that followed the collapse of the initial bill. Among them was Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who told fellow Democrats at a closed-door caucus late Thursday that he would now be supporting the bill, after previously voting no, Democratic aides said. Still, Democratic and Republican leaders preached caution, and vowed not to move ahead this time until they are confident they have the votes. 
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) said the outcome is still unknown, but the bill "is likelier to pass than before." Mr. Frank said in a CNN interview that lawmakers, after spending a few days in their districts, are more attuned to the growing credit squeeze in local communities. "A number of people began to hear about economic difficulty," he said. "I think the reality is it hit some members." 
Also helping are sweeteners added to the Senate bill, including a 10-year, $150 billion package of business and individual tax cuts and a temporary increase in deposit-insurance limits. The Senate approved the package Wednesday on a 74-25 vote, with Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Barack Obama of Illinois, the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, joining in support. 
Congressional aides said the two rivals in the race for the White House have been calling rank-and-file House members to rally support. Supporters need to find 12 new backers to ensure passage, assuming all other votes remain the same. The challenge for leaders in both parties, who were frantically working the phones, was to try to pin down support as lawmakers took stock of the Senate bill. The news wasn't always good. 
Rep. Edward Markey, for example, voted for the bill initially. But the Massachusetts Democrat, a strong environmentalist, raised concerns Thursday with tax provisions in the Senate bill promoting wider use of coal and other fossil fuels, congressional aides said. 
Environmental groups lobbied lawmakers to strip the coal provisions from the bill, even as they were fighting to preserve measures promoting development of renewable power, such as wind and solar energy. 
"You've got fledgling industries hanging in the balance," said Dave Hamilton, director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy programs. 
Rep. John Yarmouth (D., Ky.) was showing renewed interest in the bill, after voting no on Monday. "He finds it more agreeable," a Yarmouth spokesman said, pointing to provisions that would the lift the deposit-insurance limit to $250,000 for individual account holders, from $100,000. Mr. Yarmouth isn't a solid yes, though. "We'll be doing a lot of looking at the fine print," the spokesman said. 
The White House package is designed to calm turmoil in financial markets. The legislation would authorize the Treasury to borrow up to $700 billion to buy illiquid mortgages, securities and other assets that are creating instability in the nation's financial architecture. The legislation includes provisions to limit pay for executives at firms participating in the rescue and provides for tough oversight by Congress. 
In House balloting Monday, Democratic leaders brought 60% of their caucus for the Bush bill, while Republican leaders could only manage about a third of their party's ranks. 
There were some indications of widening support among House Republicans. Rep. Jim Ramstad (R., Minn.) voted against the bill Monday but endorsed it Thursday, citing, among other things, the Senate's decision to include an amendment that requires health insurers to provide more generous coverage for mental illnesses. 
"There's too much at stake to let the legislation fail," said Mr. Ramstad, a longtime proponent of the mental-health bill. 
A spokesman said Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R., Ohio) was looking at details of the Senate bill, and was "highly encouraged" about the measure. Mr. Tiberi voted against the original bill, but is a big supporter of raising deposit-insurance limits. 
Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R., Mich.) suggested he is reassessing his thinking. Mr. Hoekstra, too, voted against the bill. But he is a supporter of lifting the deposit-insurance cap, as well as provisions in the Senate bill designed to ease mark-to-market accounting rules that some businesses contend have added to the instability of financial markets. 
"I think the things that have happened in the last few days are positive," Mr. Hoekstra said on CNBC. He still hasn't made up his mind. But he added, "The bill's moving in the right direction."

Abstract 
Associate Professor Department of Economics Frostburg State University Frostburg, Md. --- Al Gore's call for rebellion is almost certainly hanging on the coattails of the recent decision by a U.K. jury to acquit activists who had vandalized a new coal-fired power plant on the grounds of preventing global warming. 

Full Text 
Your "Gore's Rebellion" editorial (Sept. 29) captures part of what Al Gore is doing, but not everything. It would be one thing if Mr. Gore simply were another ideological environmentalist with no other stake than "saving the planet." However, if Mr. Gore is successful at stopping the construction of new coal-fired power plants, he stands to profit very, very handsomely. 
We should not forget that Mr. Gore is a major partner in Kleiner Perkins, an investment fund that seeks to bankroll "alternative energy" projects. Now, if his pet projects had to compete head-to-head with coal-fired plants, his return on investment would be near zero, and would be negative if these projects were not heavily subsidized through tax breaks and outright payments from taxpayers. Thus, Mr. Gore simply is trying to hamstring the competition, and in so doing, he will become a very wealthy man. 
William L. Anderson, Ph.D. Associate Professor Department of Economics Frostburg State University Frostburg, Md. 
Al Gore's call for rebellion is almost certainly hanging on the coattails of the recent decision by a U.K. jury to acquit activists who had vandalized a new coal-fired power plant on 
the grounds of preventing global warming. 
But this is OK, don't you understand, since global climate change is more important than democracy because it's a religion, demanding faith in the absence of evidence, total 
adherence from its advocates and the demonization of all blasphemers.

Abstract 
Speaking last Wednesday on a celebrity panel in New York, the Nobel Peace Laureate proclaimed: "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." 

Full Text 
For a while, it was a standard-issue Al Gore jeremiad, with calls for everything from installing solar panels in Darfur (seriously) to legal action against "the carbon lobby" for denying global warning (ditto). But then Mr. Gore really got going and told his disciples to head -- literally -- to the barricades to "stop" coal. 
Speaking last Wednesday on a celebrity panel in New York, the Nobel Peace Laureate proclaimed: "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." He added, "clean coal does not exist." 
Mr. Gore didn't explain how far he thinks his young acolytes should go in their rage against the coal-burning machines that provide about 50% of U.S. electricity. Sit-ins? Marches against power plants? How about trashing power lines: What could he mean by "civil disobedience"? 
As it happens, Mr. Gore's brand of anticoal radicalism is quickly becoming the liberal consensus. The greens loathe coal because of greenhouse gases -- and have succeeded in making new coal plants nearly impossible to build. More than 60 have been canceled in the last year alone. Democratic Governor Kathleen Sebelius is waging a high-profile campaign against new coal plants in Kansas, and only last week Joe Biden seemed to endorse a coal ban. 
Perhaps James Hansen has also paid Mr. Gore a visit at Walden Pond. The NASA scientist and influential global warming swami recently testified on behalf of the "Kingsnorth Six," Greenpeace activists who caused GBP 30,000 of criminal damage at an English coal utility while attempting to shut it down. Mr. Hansen argued they had a "lawful excuse" because of the imminence of climate doom; they were acquitted. Coming from figures who hold the public trust, such rhetoric is wildly irresponsible, not least for the fanaticism and even violence it could incite. 
Mr. Gore's blessing is even more bizarre because it defeats the cause that it claims to champion on its own terms. New U.S. coal plants use modern scrubbing technology, which means less traditional air pollution. They're also far more efficient -- that is, they get more energy out of the same amount of coal (i.e., carbon) compared to older models. Often this results in power companies mothballing parts of a more carbon-intensive fleet. 
Take a fracas in North Carolina, where Duke Energy is trying to build a new coal-burning plant. The 800-megawatt Cliffside project has proved hugely controversial; Duke CEO Jim Rogers told us that his home had been vandalized. Yet when regulators approved Cliffside, they noted that the state-of-the-art upgrade will actually reduce environmental costs because four aging, less efficient boilers will be shut down. Overall, sulfur dioxide emissions will fall by 80% a year, nitrogen oxide by 50%, and the entire project is carbon neutral while producing more electricity to meet increasing demand. 
Mr. Gore seems to think this is a bad trade. Meanwhile, China is set to build 800,000 megawatts of new coal generation over the next eight years. That's 1,000 Cliffsides -- or more than two-and-a-half times the size of America's total installed coal capacity, with none of our environmental guardrails. Even if every U.S. coal plant were razed to the ground tomorrow, it wouldn't make any difference for global CO2 while China expands. 
We look forward to seeing Mr. Gore take his "civil disobedience" against coal to, say, Shanxi province. He'd better bring a lot to read.

Biden's Coal Slaw

Abstract 
In theory, clean coal would require capturing greenhouse gas emissions, compressing them into liquid and then pumping it underneath the earth. 

Full Text 
The classic definition of a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth, and specialists like Joe Biden can work wonders with the form. On Tuesday Barack Obama's running mate blew an easy question about coal, revealing volumes about liberal energy politics. 
Working the rope line in Maumee, Ohio, the Senator was asked by an environmentalist why he and Mr. Obama support "clean coal." "We're not supporting clean coal," Mr. Biden responded. Then, riffing on China's breakneck construction of new coal plants, he continued, "No coal plants here in America. Build them, if they're going to build them, over there." 
Coal happens to be the indispensable workhorse of the U.S. power system, providing about 50% of the country's electricity. Many Democrats nonetheless despise coal -­because of pollution before the era of scrubbers, but especially now because of carbon emissions. Al Gore favors an outright moratorium on coal-fired power in the name of climate change. Meanwhile, any scheme to tax and regulate carbon -- like the cap-and-trade program backed by Mr. Obama and John McCain -- would hit coal first and hardest, effectively banishing it from the U.S. energy mix. 
Mr. Biden, then, only stated an obvious if politically unutterable truth. The real costs of green ambitions won't be paid by well-heeled coastal liberals, but will fall disproportionately on the Southern and Midwestern states that depend on coal for jobs and power. The blue- collar voters of Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and so forth will get hurt most -- notwithstanding Mr. Biden's campaign reinvention as the scrapper from Scranton. 
As for "clean coal," the Obama campaign actually supports it. But this too is a political bait-and-switch, perhaps explaining Mr. Biden's confusion. In theory, clean coal would require capturing greenhouse gas emissions, compressing them into liquid and then pumping it underneath the earth. Even if the technology were ready for commercial deployment tomorrow, to sequester just 25% of yearly U.S. CO2 emissions would mean moving volumes more than twice as large as the world's current oil pipeline system can handle. That will require an enormous amount of money, and generations to build. 
That an eminence like Mr. Biden is clueless about coal suggests how little official Washington has thought through the consequences of its anticarbon agenda. His blunder is also notable because it exposed the realities that politicians prefer not to voice amid an election campaign. Coal-state voters should be watching what their politicians really have planned for them come January.

U.S. News -- The Week Ahead: Efforts to Curtail Emissions Gain; More Firms Believe Emitting Gases Will Cost Money

Abstract 
Each year, those states will issue a limited number of permits allowing the power plants to emit carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that results from the burning of fuels such as coal and natural gas. 

Full Text 
How Washington might crack down on global-warming emissions won't be clear until after the fall election. But this week will bring two signs that U.S companies believe change is on the way. 
Monday, the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project will report that more multinational corporations believe emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the U.S. will soon start costing money. 
On Thursday, the first program to slap a mandatory cap on greenhouse-gas emissions in the U.S. will swing into motion. Ten Northeastern states have joined together to limit emissions from power plants within their borders under a program called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. 
Each year, those states will issue a limited number of permits allowing the power plants to emit carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that results from the burning of fuels such as coal and natural gas. The power plants will have to buy permits at a price determined by an auction. The first cap doesn't hit until next year, but the first auction for the permits will take place this week. 
If U.S. companies are starting to see climate change as a serious business issue, though, they aren't sure how to respond. 
Of the 321 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project's questionnaire this year, 81% said they see global warming as a risk, but 33% said they have come up with targets to curb their emissions. 
Consider the lack of clarity in the Northeast emissions cap. 
For now, it lacks much bite. The number of permits the 10 states plan to auction off for next year would allow more emissions -- not fewer -- than the plants are expected to emit. Planners assumed when they set the cap that emissions would have risen above it by the time it took effect, meaning the cap would force a cut. In fact, emissions have been dropping, in part because falling natural-gas prices have induced power plants to shift to that less-emitting fuel. So analysts expect low permit prices at this week's auction. 
Even a small energy tax, however, could hurt Northeast power producers whose competitors in other states face no cap at all. 
"We need to remove the imbalance as quickly as we can," said Donald McCloskey, director of environmental strategy and policy for Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., a New Jersey power company that will be hit by the cap. He added, "We need to transition quickly to a national program" to cap greenhouse-gas emissions. Why? To spread the pain.

Energy (A Special Report): Producers; Cleaning Up Coal's Act: New projects offer the chance to tap inaccessible reserves, as well as limit the release of harmful gases

Abstract 
Building on pilot projects in the U.S. and elsewhere, the two countries are also looking at the possibility of capturing and permanently storing underground the gases produced, like carbon dioxide, which scientists believe cause global warming. Experts say underground gasification could triple or quadruple recoverable coal reserves globally, offsetting declines in other energy reserves such as crude oil. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- India and China are at the forefront of a new wave in clean-coal technology that has the potential to tap enormous and otherwise inaccessible coal reserves -- and to slow the speed of climate change. 
The Asian giants are investigating large-scale commercial projects that would produce energy by burning the coal where it lies, deep below the Earth's surface. Building on pilot projects in the U.S. and elsewhere, the two countries are also looking at the possibility of capturing and permanently storing underground the gases produced, like carbon dioxide, which scientists believe cause global warming. 
The underlying technology is one pioneered by the Soviets during the 1930s, called underground coal gasification -- a way to tap energy from coal that was impossible or too costly to bring to the surface. A borehole is drilled down to the coal seam, which is then ignited. Oxygen is forced down through the borehole to feed the combustion. Gases produced by the combustion are then forced out a second borehole to the surface, where they are harnessed to turn turbines or for the production of chemicals. A power plant in Uzbekistan has been using the process for nearly 50 years. But elsewhere the practice was largely abandoned as increasing reserves of oil and natural gas were discovered, providing a cheaper alternative. 
Now, thanks to higher oil and gas prices, underground coal gasification has again become cost-competitive. Advances in the technology also make the practice more attractive. Tests in Europe in the late 1990s demonstrated it was possible to have greater control of deep drilling, to create larger cavities in the coal seam for the gases and to provide more efficient combustion. Also, while the process once was criticized for generating large quantities of hydrogen as a useless byproduct, hydrogen is now in demand as a feedstock for the chemical industry and shows potential as an alternative fuel for vehicles. 
Experts say underground gasification could triple or quadruple recoverable coal reserves globally, offsetting declines in other energy reserves such as crude oil. China and India have the world's third- and fourth-largest coal reserves, respectively. The U.S. has the most, and Russia is No. 2, according to industry estimates. China is believed to have conducted more trials of the process than any other country over the past 10 years; one estimate counts at least 17 since 1991. A Chinese-built chemical plant in Inner Mongolia now uses the process to produce a diesel-fuel substitute, and the Chinese company that built the plant has plans for a much larger sister plant in China itself. India, meanwhile, plans to use underground gasification both to generate more power and to produce pesticides and chemicals. 
Heavy use of coal already in rapidly developing countries like China and India has come at a price of worsening pollution, particularly from traditional coal-fired plants that aren't fitted with equipment to strip out sulfur and capture emissions. Thus, underground gasification also presents an attractive alternative because it produces no sulfur oxide or nitrogen oxide, there are lower levels of mercury and particulates, and the ash stays underground. Experts say the technology is especially suitable for low-rank coals like lignites and sub-bituminous coal, which produce less heat when burned due to their high ash content, and are highly polluting. 
"This has driven a lot of recent investigation in India where that is a major technological limitation to their coal development because their coal is 35% to 50% ash," says Julio Friedmann, leader of the carbon-management program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. 
Other countries such as the U.S., U.K., South Africa and Australia have all shown renewed interest in the process over the past decade. Eskom Holdings Ltd., the biggest power generator in South Africa, performed a trial at the Majuba coal field north of Johannesburg, which has reserves of 1.2 billion tons. U.S. and British energy companies are studying the possibility of using it in the Powder River Basin along the Wyoming-Montana border, the largest source of mined coal in the U.S. In Britain, officials hope the process will provide access to vast coal reserves under the North Sea. 
Experts are still cautious about rolling out the process on a massive scale. There's some concern that it will contaminate underground water supplies, or cause serious incidents of subsidence, which involves land sinking into the cavities created when the coal seams are drilled and burned out. 
Mr. Friedmann says the risk of subsidence is small if a good site is chosen and the surrounding rock strata is sufficiently strong. Water contamination is avoidable, he says, if operators manage the pressure in the cavity properly. The risks of subsidence and contamination also generally decrease with depth, he says. 
Underground coal gasification isn't the only "clean-coal" technology in the works. One of the most popular is a technique known as integrated gasification combined cycle system, or IGCC. IGCC plants bring the coal to the surface, where it is heated and turned into synthetic gas, which then turns a turbine to generate electricity. Duke Energy Corp. has won approval from state regulators for a $2 billion IGCC plant in Indiana. American Electric Power Co. is pursuing IGCC projects in West Virginia and Ohio, and NRG Energy Inc. has proposed building a $1.5 billion IGCC plant in upstate New York. 
But because the above-ground process requires expensive gasification equipment -- and extraction of the coal -- it's considerably more expensive than the underground gasification process. GasTech Inc., a Casper, Wyo.-based gas-exploration company, says its studies show that capital costs of building an underground-gasification facility are 25% lower and its operating costs 50% lower than a comparable IGCC plant. 
A large-scale project that includes carbon capture and sequestration, meanwhile, is still years away. The big hope is that carbon dioxide produced in the process can be pumped back into the void left by the combustion of the coal underground, and permanently sequestered from the atmosphere, helping to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. But experts say more tests are needed before it can be proved that carbon dioxide can be permanently stored in the cavities created, and at an affordable cost. Indeed, carbon capture would likely make underground gasification more expensive. 
China has about 30 projects in different phases of preparation that use underground coal gasification, says Ming Sung, a former vice- president of XinAo Holdings Ltd., a unit of the Chinese energy company ENN Group. Mr. Sung is now chief representative, Asia-Pacific, at the Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based nonprofit advocacy group. So far, there is only one plant operating, a methanol plant in Inner Mongolia operated by ENN Group. But the company is drawing up plans for a similar plant in Liaoning province that will be 15 times larger, says Mr. Sung. The new plant will produce 300,000 metric tons of methanol a year, which will be converted into dimethyl ether, a substitute for diesel. A spokeswoman for ENN's XinAo unit says the plant is still in the preparation stage. 
India, meanwhile, wants to use underground gasification to access an estimated 350 billion tons of coal discovered by state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. in the states of Gujarat and West Bengal. Some of the carbon dioxide produced could be pumped into underground oil reservoirs to boost recovery of heavy oil discovered in Gujarat. This is being done in an Energy Department-funded project straddling the U.S. and Canadian border. Dakota Gasification Co. is piping carbon dioxide from a coal-gasification plant in Beulah, N.D., to an oil field in Saskatchewan where it has helped increase the field's production, according to the Energy Department. 
Last year, India compiled a 93-page status report on underground coal gasification that highlighted plans from many of the country's biggest companies, including Oil & Natural Gas, the conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. and state-run natural-gas distributor GAIL India Ltd. According to the report, GAIL envisages three commercial UCG-powered plants in operation by 2015. The company declined to comment. 
Many companies say they want governments to provide incentives before they get involved. In its submission to the Indian government, for example, Reliance Industries said it wanted a similar fiscal regime to that provided to producers of coalbed methane because UCG "remains untested in India and has many inherent uncertainties." These incentives include a tax holiday for seven years and the freedom to use, sell and price any gas that is produced. A company spokesman declined to comment further.

Abstract 
What's the thinking behind cap-and-trade? A cap-and-trade system uses financial incentives to encourage companies to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they emit. The EU system covers six industrial sectors: pulp and paper makers, concrete, glass and steel producers, electric utilities and oil refineries. 

Full Text 
Over the past decade, many countries have taken up the fight against global warming by crafting policies to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Some have slapped taxes on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. Others have chosen a system that establishes an overall limit on carbon-dioxide emissions and then allows companies to buy and sell the right to pollute within that limit. 
The European Union was the first to try the latter approach, known as a cap-and-trade system or emissions trading. The U.S. has debated adopting such a system, but in June the Senate voted overwhelmingly against it, worried that it would saddle consumers with higher energy prices and hurt the economy. The U.S. is likely to reconsider the idea at some point, however, since both presidential candidates support cap-and-trade. 
So how exactly does a cap-and-trade system work? How effective has this approach been in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions? How will the costs affect consumers and companies? Here are some answers to those and other questions about this policy option. 
-- What's the thinking behind cap-and-trade? 
A cap-and-trade system uses financial incentives to encourage companies to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide they emit. A regulatory body sets an overall limit, or cap, on annual carbon- dioxide emissions and then assigns shares of that total to major polluters. If a company wants to emit more than its individual cap allows, it must buy emission permits from a business that is emitting less than its allotment. 
Over time the pollution caps are ratcheted down, making it more costly to keep polluting, and achieving the desired reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The idea is that this system will cut pollution more effectively and at a lower overall cost than other regulatory approaches. For instance, cap-and-trade provides more certainty on emissions levels than a carbon tax because it sets firm limits on pollutants. Cap-and- trade is also thought to be more cost-effective than other policies because it allows each company to decide how to reduce its emissions, and companies presumably will choose the cheapest way to achieve their goals. By contrast, measures imposed by the government, like a requirement to adopt a certain cleaner technology, might not be the most cost-effective method for every company. 
-- Who participates under the EU setup? 
The EU system covers six industrial sectors: pulp and paper makers, concrete, glass and steel producers, electric utilities and oil refineries. The system, which has been in place since 2005, covers about 11,500 industrial facilities, accounting for about half of Europe's total greenhouse-gas emissions. Emissions from cars, planes and buildings aren't covered by the rules. 
-- How is the system set up? 
Here's how it works in Europe: The European Union Commission on the Environment sets overall limits for carbon-dioxide emissions in each of the EU's 27 member states. Each country then submits an allocation plan to the commission, spelling out what share of the country's allotment will go to each participating factory. Emissions permits are distributed based on those allocations, with each permit giving the holder the right to emit one kilogram of carbon dioxide. For example, a large iron and steel works in Scunthorpe, England, owned by Tata Steel Group's Corus unit, will be allocated 8.3 million permits each year from 2008 through 2012. 
Allocations are based in part on the emissions expected at each plant, but policy makers also consider the impact on each business of the cost of cutting emissions. By giving more permits to companies that they think would be crippled by added costs, they can protect jobs. The allocation of permits is often the subject of intense lobbying by industries. 
So far most of the permits distributed by governments have been given away free, but that is changing. Governments across Europe are moving toward auctioning at least a portion of the permits to raise the cost of polluting. The U.K. will auction off 7% of its permits for the 2008-2012 period, and the EU Commission has floated the idea that all permits to the power sector should be auctioned after 2013. 
Each December, companies are required to turn in to national authorities one permit for each kilogram of carbon dioxide they emit into the air, based on calculations that include measuring the amount of fuel they burn or electricity they consume. These figures are audited annually by independent firms to ensure their accuracy. Companies that have exceeded their emissions allocation need to buy additional permits to turn in to the authorities. 
-- So how would a company go about buying those additional permits? 
A company that needs permits can buy them directly from a company that has some to spare. But most permits are bought and sold on electronic exchanges. 
In addition to the companies that must abide by emissions caps, banks, hedge funds and other investors can trade carbon permits just as they would any other financial instrument. Most of the big international banks -- including Barclays PLC, Merrill Lynch & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Allianz SE's Dresdner Kleinwort unit -- have set up emissions-trading operations. They advise clients on when to buy and sell permits, publish research on the permit market and manage their own portfolios of permit investments. The market is expanding rapidly: According to the World Bank, some $50 billion of carbon permits changed hands in 2007, more than twice the amount traded in 2006. 
Just as a company's share price changes constantly, so does the price of a carbon-emissions permit. Several factors can influence the demand for permits and therefore their prices, including energy prices, extreme weather and economic growth. For example, if the price of natural gas increases sharply, some utilities might turn to more coal to produce electricity, increasing their carbon-dioxide emissions, meaning they'll need more permits to offset the added pollution. Or if a recession hits Europe and construction slows, steel factories would reduce production, emitting less pollution, meaning they'll need fewer permits at the end of the year. 
Complying with emissions caps hasn't proved too costly for companies yet, but as caps are lowered, obeying the rules will require real changes or extra costs for companies. Companies will have to decide what they prefer: to pay for extra permits or pay to revamp their operations to pollute less. 
-- How effective has this system been? 
Carbon-dioxide emissions have actually risen in the EU since the cap-and-trade system was instituted in 2005 -- by 1.1% in the first year and 0.8% in the second year, according to the European Commission. 
Policy makers and environmental experts agree that the early years of the system were hobbled by one major mistake: European governments, worried about hurting their economies and big employers, set the initial emissions cap too high. That left room for emissions to grow under the cap and gave companies no real incentive to revamp their factories. European regulators have already moved to address the problem: Fewer permits will be issued during the program's second phase, from 2008 to 2012. In the end, the effectiveness of any cap- and-trade system depends on political will. 
-- Doesn't a cap-and-trade system just make everything more expensive? 
By requiring companies to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, caps raise the cost of generating electricity for power utilities and make it more expensive for manufacturers to produce goods. It's inevitable that some of these extra costs would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 
But in the real world, it's difficult to discern the exact impact of carbon caps on consumer prices. Prices for electricity and gasoline depend on a range of factors such as regulation, tax levels and general market demand; figuring out how much a carbon cap added to the price tag is tricky. And prices for consumer goods also depend on a myriad of factors, with the carbon cap accounting for only a sliver of any change. 
There haven't been any major studies of how Europe's prices for energy and consumer goods have been affected, if at all, since its system started in 2005. 
A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that middle- income U.S. households would see annual cost increases totaling 2.8% of their income under a cap-and­trade system designed to cut emissions by 15% from 1998 levels. Poorer people would be harder hit, with higher prices eating up 3.3% of their income, while richer people would see prices increase by only 1.7% of their income. 
-- What are some of the objections to a cap-and-trade system? 
Some economists think that taxing carbon-dioxide emissions is preferable to emissions trading because it's a much simpler way to change the behavior of companies. Proponents of a carbon tax argue that it does the same thing as emissions trading -- provide a financial incentive to reduce pollution -- without the extra expense and hassle of setting up a whole new market. They argue that a tax allows for less political gaming and lobbying by affected industries. Proponents of carbon taxes include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and economist Joseph Stiglitz. But few policy makers expect such a tax to be politically palatable in the U.S. 
Some environmentalists oppose cap-and-trade as too kind to polluting industries. But most major green groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and the Sierra Club, have embraced the approach as the best compromise: feasible politically and good for the planet.

The tangibly struggling economy aside, it is nonetheless striking how mundane an issue terrorism has become for the 2008 presidential election when compared with the subject's political dominance and hold on voters' heartstrings over the previous seven years since 9/11. 
Counterterrorism remains the preeminent national-security concern -- the context for debate over U.S. policy on Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, among other areas -- but it's not the campaign issue this time. As a host of intelligence reports and jihadist communications demonstrates, the threat from al Qaeda and similar quarters remains real, though part of a larger national-security context in which the importance of Russia, China and other players has reemerged. The recent trial of eight Britons charged with trying to blow up trans- Atlantic flights in 2006 produced mixed verdicts but still put on display the horrible ambition of the group founded by Osama bin Laden, as the Los Angeles Times reports. Just yesterday, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized the importance of stepping up the fight against resurgent al Qaeda-allied Taliban in Afghanistan and nominal U.S. ally Pakistan, even as he declared himself "not convinced we're winning in Afghanistan," as The Wall Street Journal reports. 
At a time when the U.S. military is stretched, the zero-sum conundrum over troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq was made clear again this week with President Bush's announcement of a small decrease in the number of U.S. service members in Iraq and reassignment of some units to Afghanistan instead. Testifying with Adm. Mullen, Defense Secretary Robert Gates went so far as to say the U.S. had entered the "endgame" in Iraq as it increases its commitment to Afghanistan -- a statement that seems at odds with the caution about potential reversal in Iraq repeatedly expressed by the man who'll be overseeing operations in both places, Gen. David H. Petraeus. 
Meanwhile, senior American officials tell the New York Times that Mr. Bush "secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government." This follows "months of high-level stalemate" over how to challenge Taliban and al Qaeda use of Pakistani territory for their fight in Afghanistan, the Times says. While long sought by critics of Bush administration policy on Pakistan, the move poses its own problems, as evidenced by yesterday's assertion by Pakistani Army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani that Islamabad will defend its sovereignty against such incursions "at all costs," as the Times reports. 
Domestic counterterrorism, too, remains active in Washington debates with no small political resonance. This week Democratic members of the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees issued a report slamming the Bush administration for failing to put in place four- year-old recommendations from the federal 9/11 commission, saying the uncompleted initiatives include: "incorporating passenger and cargo screening systems at airports; sharing information on terrorist and other criminal activity through federal, state and regional fusion centers; integrating national biosurveillance efforts; and modernizing the visa waiver program, which uses an electronic system to determine travel eligibility to foreigners visiting" the U.S., as Government Executive reports. 
. . . As Campaigns Focus on Each Other || While the campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama -- who meet today under an electoral truce at New York City's 9/11 commemoration -- frequently trade disparagement over the fight against terrorism, their policies on many fronts aren't so different, as the Los Angeles Times notes. "Both McCain and Obama have pledged to retool much of the Bush administration's self-declared war on terrorism, saying it has been heavy-handed, too militaristic and unpopular at home and abroad," the Times says. They both call for a greater troop deployment to Afghanistan, a larger U.S. military, a fresh approach to tracking Mr. bin Laden, new policies on Pakistan, a halt to interrogation practices considered by some to be torture, the closing of Guantanamo Bay detention facilities, and a reemphasis on "'soft power' tactics that emphasize winning the hearts and minds of those leaning toward extremism and anti-American beliefs," the paper points out. Their once gaping differences on Iraq have converged as the White House and Mr. McCain's ideas came closer to those espoused by Mr. Obama, with both now seeking to withdraw most American forces -- Mr. McCain a few years later than Mr. Obama -- and both giving caveats that could prolong a large deployment there. 
But the big campaign stories of late haven't been about terrorism. Mr. McCain's team has launched a broadside of attacks on Mr. Obama, as the Washington Post reports. Mr. Obama, showing what The Wall Street Journal calls "signs of being distracted by the enthusiasm" on the other side, is readying what the paper reports is "a sharper message focused on economic anxiety." Politico reports that with the battle heating up -- and in response to the "unrelenting press scrutiny" on Ms. Palin -- the McCain campaign has recruited many additional Republican operatives, including a large contingent of advisers who worked for the Bush-Cheney effort. The amorphous theme of "change" and the economy continue to be the most resonant issues for now. But considering the political success the Bush-Cheney ticket had four years ago appealing to voters' concerns about terror, it's a topic that might get a lot more attention between now and November. 
Oh, and About That OPEC Cut . . . 
Saudi Arabian officials yesterday privately told participants in global oil markets that they didn't feel bound by OPEC's decision on Tuesday to cut back on oil production, the New York Times reports. Oil traders apparently weren't surprised. As The Wall Street Journal reports, despite an initial bump in prices, oil markets fell, "reflecting distrust of the cartel's ability to enforce quotas and fears that world consumption growth will sputter further." 
Also of Note. . . 
New York Times: As Congress prepares to debate expansion of drilling in taxpayer-owned coastal waters, the Interior Department agency that collects oil and gas royalties has been caught up in a wide-ranging ethics scandal -- including allegations of financial self-dealing, accepting gifts from energy companies, cocaine use and sexual misconduct. In three reports delivered to Congress, the department's inspector general found wrongdoing by a dozen current and former employees of the Minerals Management Service, which collects about $10 billion in royalties annually and is one of the government's largest sources of revenue other than taxes. 
Wall Street Journal: The Pentagon canceled a $40 billion competition to buy aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, delivering a victory to Boeing and setting up what could be an even fiercer battle for the contract next year. The decision to punt the competition until a new presidential administration is in place highlights the gridlock and hardball tactics that increasingly characterize the already slow process of defense procurement. 
Washington Post: North Korean leader Kim Jong Il probably suffered a cerebral hemorrhage last month, but his condition isn't critical and there is "no power vacuum" in the communist North, according to the chief of the South Korean National Intelligence Service. Briefing a parliamentary committee in Seoul, the intelligence chief, Kim Sung-ho, said that Kim Jong Il's condition is "manageable" and he is recovering, according to Won Hye-young, a committee member who attended the briefing. 
BBC: A member of the pro-Syrian opposition in Lebanon has been killed in a car bombing southeast of Beirut, security officials said, a day after the president announced that reconciliation talks among rival factions would be held next week. 
Financial Times: Germany, the U.K. and Spain all face recessions this year, the European Commission forecast, dashing finally any remaining hopes that Europe would avoid a sharp economic downturn. France and Italy would fare little better, it said. The steep downward revisions in growth forecasts by the European Union's executive arm showed it had accepted that tumbling business and consumer confidence was hitting economic activity -- even though the European economy had been "generally sound" prior to the credit crisis. 
Dow Jones Newswires: Russia could use part of its pension and oil windfall funds to support financial markets amid a slump in stock prices, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said today, according to the Interfax news agency. Russia's stock market has plummeted 50% since its mid-May high after a run of bad news prompted investors to raise risk premiums. 
Roll Call: Senate Republicans say they fear they might have lost their edge on the energy issue after some of their GOP colleagues joined the bipartisan "Gang of 10" that is pursuing a compromise. Its ranks have swelled to 16 members, and Majority Leader Harry Reid has agreed to give a floor vote next week to their proposal. Republican Conference Vice Chairman John Cornyn and others also acknowledged that much of the unhappiness with the group's members stems from the fact that it could undercut the GOP's energy messaging efforts. Faced with few winning polling issues, Republicans seized on the energy issue and gas prices in particular this summer. 
Independent: A British jury concluded that the threat of global warming is so great that environmental activists were justified in causing roughly $70,000 worth of damage to a coal-fired power station during a protest stunt last year. The jury at Maidstone Crown Court cleared six Greenpeace activists of criminal damage, accepting defense arguments that the six had a "lawful excuse" to damage property. 
Bloomberg: Bristol-Myers Squibb may have to raise its offer for ImClone Systems after Carl Icahn, chairman of the biotechnology company, said a "large pharmaceutical company" he wouldn't identify bid $6.1 billion. 
Detroit News: Chrysler President Jim Press defended a controversial plan to provide low-cost, federal loans to automakers, saying U.S. manufacturers needed the money to help them pursue technological advances and ensure that the U.S. didn't end up exchanging its dependence on foreign oil for a reliance on imported batteries. 
Detroit Free Press: About 4,200 autoworkers still must go at Ford Motor. That's the number of excess hourly workers that the auto maker has in North America, the company told union officials during private Ford-UAW meetings on Tuesday and yesterday. 
Women's Wear Daily: The fight against global counterfeiting and piracy was front and center yesterday with the introduction of legislation in Congress that would provide more money to enforce intellectual-property laws and create new penalties. The bipartisan bill would require the office of the U.S. Trade Representative to take specific steps to stop violations, increase the budget for the USTR to assist developing countries in improving intellectual-property protection and establish enforcement tools to crack down on countries that refuse to combat theft of U.S. intellectual property. 
Variety: Universal Pictures has cut a deal to mount a live-action film based on Sid and Marty Krofft's '70s kidshow "Sigmund and the Sea Monsters," following its earlier deal to produce another film revival of a onetime Krofft Saturday morning show, "Land of the Lost," that will star Will Ferrell. "Sigmund" becomes the third studio property set up for movie treatment for the Krofft brothers: Sony is developing a live-action version of "H.R. Pufnstuff." 
Quotes of the Day 
"I feel like I'm playing whack-a-mole every day," Lehman Brothers Holdings Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Fuld Jr. said recently, according to people familiar with calls he made to Wall Street executives to make sure they were still trading with his embattled firm and offering it credit even as rumors about Lehman's health kept popping up, The Wall Street Journal reports. Yesterday, Mr. Fuld stepped up his offensive, using an early-morning conference call to say that Lehman, staggered by $6.7 billion in losses in the past two quarters, will spin off to its shareholders the "vast majority" of its commercial real-estate assets, sell a substantial stake in its investment-management division and slash its dividend by 93%. By reducing balance-sheet risks and focusing on client-based businesses, Mr. Fuld said, Lehman will "emerge clean." 
"In the current market you have to be either really huge or you have to be dominant in one business or in a good niche. They are not huge and they were dominant in fixed income, but that game is over in the near term," Len Blum, of financial advisory group Westwood Capital, tells the New York Times, which says that Lehman's shrinking size means that to remain viable in the future, the firm might need to be part of a larger institution. 
"This could be the mother of year-ends," Brian Sack, of Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Federal Reserve chief market analyst, tells Bloomberg, which says the Fed may have to increase the cash it provides to banks and brokers beyond already-record levels to help them balance their books at the end of the year in the wake of six bank failures in the past two months and rising concern about Lehman's capital levels. Lenders' borrowing costs may climb further as companies rush for cash to settle trades and buttress their balance sheets at year-end, Bloomberg says.

In the latest instance of state officials taking the lead in the regulation of greenhouse gases, New York state has secured an agreement with one of the largest operators of coal-burning power plants to share with its investors the risks posed to the business by global warming. 
Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy and four other publicly traded power generators were subpoenaed nearly a year ago by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who wanted to know if their disclosures to the Securities and Exchanges Commission adequately detailed their exposure to the problem. And if that action was nominally aimed at attaining financial information, its implicit goal seems to have been a bid to reduce emissions at a time when the federal government has done little on that front. Minnesota environmentalists tell the Pioneer Press their hope is that investors will bring greater pressure on the company once they see the hidden costs of producing carbon dioxide -­costs likely to grow under tighter rules in the next presidential administration. "Coal-fired power cannot be considered cheap anymore when you factor in the damage caused by global warming and the future costs of carbon regulations," J. Drake Hamilton, senior science director of Fresh Energy, tells the paper. Xcel said it already gives investor information about the additional costs of CO2 regulation but agreed with Mr. Cuomo's office to make a fuller account, and that it expects future laws to have a greater impact. 
The agreement is the first of its kind in the U.S., according to the New York Times, but its just the latest in a skein of state actions aimed at forcing industry and Washington to reduce emissions. California and other states have sought to force the auto makers to do so. And just last week, New York and California were among a dozen mostly coastal states that sued the Environmental Protection Agency over CO2 from oil refineries, accusing the EPA of violating the Clean Air Act by refusing to issue new emission standards. Until now, environmental advocates have tried to use shareholder resolutions to affect practices in the power industry and push for an expansion of renewable sources like wind and solar power, the Times notes. 
Mr. Cuomo was able to move against Xcel, Dynegy, AES, Peabody Energy and Dominion Resources last year under an 87-year-old state law granting him some authority over companies doing business in the state, even if that business is just a stock listing. But some Eastern states have for years already clashed with the power-producing companies in the Midwest because the air pollution produced by their plants can blow across state borders, The Wall Street Journal adds. With both major presidential candidates vowing to reverse the Bush administration's opposition to significantly tighter regulation of greenhouse gases, others in the emission-producing industries may have an incentive to voluntarily join such agreements before the year is out. 
Nominee Obama 
The presumptive nominee no more, Barack Obama last night strode onto the podium of the Democratic Convention as the first African-American standard bearer of a major political party. Mr. Obama's previously unannounced appearance followed former President Bill Clinton's bid to make the case for an Obama presidency, and vice presidential nominee Joe Biden's arguments for Mr. Obama and against Republican John McCain. After running through a host of problems facing the U.S., from terrorism and indebtedness to diplomatic seclusion and global warming, the once belligerently reticent Mr. Clinton offered a hearty endorsement to his wife's onetime rival. "Clearly, the job of the next President is to rebuild the American Dream and restore America's standing in the world," he said. "Everything I learned in my eight years as President and in the work I've done since, in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job." 
Mr. Biden, after recounting his own working-class upbringing, stressed Mr. Obama's own fatherless youth and what Mr. Obama has done for working-class families in Illinois. And he laid into his friend -- "I mean it. John McCain is my friend." -- reiterating the Democratic line that the soon-to-be Republican nominee would mean a four-year continuation of the Bush administration. Tonight, it will be Mr. Obama's turn and possibly his best chance to define himself to American voters at a time when polls suggest many don't yet know him well enough to feel comfortable sending the junior senator to the White House. Mr. Obama's advisers tell The Wall Street Journal he, too, will highlight his differences from President Bush and Sen. McCain. But his biggest challenge -- after a summer in which Republicans tried to paint him as substance-less rock star -- may be to employ the powerful presence and rhetorical skills he has shown this year in ways that not only inspire, but give voters a concrete sense of what an Obama presidency would bring. 
The McCain Choices 
Tomorrow, Sen. McCain plans to unveil his choice for a running mate, a senior campaign official tells Politico. And he plans to tell this person today. Three sources also tell Politico that Karl Rove called independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman last week to urge him to take himself out of the running to be Mr. McCain's vice presidential choice, and that Mr. Lieberman dismissed that request. 
Also of Note. . . 
New Orleans Times-Picayune: If Gustav heads into southeast Louisiana, scientists and engineers agree that large swaths of the region could be at great risk of flooding from even a moderate storm surge, especially neighborhoods near the Industrial Canal and on the West Bank of Jefferson Parish. More than $2 billion in repairs and improvements made to the system since Katrina cracked it open three years ago have strengthened some weak spots. Though no one will know for days exactly where Tropical Storm Gustav will march ashore, New Orleans area officials started announcing contingency plans for housing, emergency transportation, drainage and evacuation. And just two days before the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's onslaught on the New Orleans area and the ensuing levee breaks, Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a pre-storm state of emergency. 
Wall Street Journal: The Securities and Exchange Commission signaled the demise of U.S. accounting standards, kicking off a process that could ultimately require all publicly listed American companies to follow an international model instead. Introduced in two steps, the shift could eventually cut costs for companies and smooth cross-border investing. At the same time, investors worry it will create confusion, especially during the transition. 
Associated Press: China and Iraq have signed a $3 billion deal revising an earlier agreement for China's biggest oil company to help develop the Ahdab oil field, according to a statement from the Iraqi Embassy in Beijing. The deal, restoring a project canceled after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, would increase the anticipated output from the billion-barrel field to 110,000 barrels per day from the originally planned 90,000 barrels per day, the statement said. 
Washington Post: The top Marine Corps general said the U.S. military will hand over security responsibilities to Iraqi forces next week in Iraq's western province of Anbar, paving the way to reduce the 25,000- strong Marine contingent there and free up more Marines to go to Afghanistan. Gen. James T. Conway said Anbar no longer requires such a large number of Marines, who would be better employed fighting in Afghanistan, where he said the Taliban insurgency is "growing bolder." 
New York Times: The U.S. military has secretly handed over more than 200 militants to the intelligence services of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries, nearly all in the past two years, as part of an effort to reduce the burden of detaining and interrogating foreign fighters captured in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to American military officials. The system is similar in some ways to the rendition program used by the Central Intelligence Agency since the 9/11 attacks to secretly transfer people suspected of being militants back to their home countries to be jailed and questioned. But there are significant differences; the prisoners can block their transfers to home countries, military officials say. And officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross interview all detainees before they are returned to their home countries, a Red Cross spokesman, said. 
Wall Street Journal: MVM, one of the biggest security contractors used by U.S. intelligence agencies, has lost the bulk of a CIA contract in Iraq after failing to provide enough armed guards, according to company emails and contractors familiar with the decision. The loss of the CIA contract, which was potentially worth more than $1 billion over five years, is a big blow to closely held MVM. 
Financial Times: Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering group, has held talks with sovereign wealth funds from the Persian Gulf, Russia and other regions in an attempt to expand its long-term investor base. 
Seattle Post-Intelligencer: Microsoft's next Internet Explorer version will come with a special mode that, when activated, stops the program from recording browsing history or storing data and files related to the Web sites a user visits. To everyone else, it's "porn mode," but Microsoft calls it "InPrivate Browsing." And the company's marketers are doing their best to imagine other scenarios in which it could come in handy. 
Detroit News: Chrysler is the latest auto maker to consider shedding an iconic brand, announcing it has hired a financial consultant to advise the company in the possible sale of its Dodge Viper business. Sales of the two-seat, 600-horsepower sports car, with a price tag that begins at $88,125, represent a small fraction of the auto maker's overall business, but if sold, it could help the company in "leveraging its assets," Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli said. 
Nikkei: Toyota Motor said today that it has downgraded its global sales goal for fiscal 2009 to 9.7 million vehicles from the previously stated 10.4 million due to the bleak outlook for the North American market. The auto maker also disclosed plans to strengthen efforts to expand sales of environmentally friendly vehicles, for which demand is growing world-wide, and to start mass-producing next-generation electric cars in the early 2010s. 
San Jose Mercury News: Dell, the world's second-largest personal- computer maker, showed four new PCs that will sell in China and 20 other emerging markets, its biggest push so far to tap growth in markets expanding much faster than the U.S. The two laptops and two desktops, called Vostro and priced at $400 to $500 in China, will begin shipping in August and be available in Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East by November, Round Rock, Dell said. 
South China Morning Post: Three years after it opened, Hong Kong Disneyland this year is finally expected to achieve its original first-year attendance target of 5.6 million, a marked improvement on last year's figure of less than 4.2 million. 
Quote of the Day 
"What the Americans call humanitarian cargoes -- of course, they are bringing in weapons," Russian President Dmitri Medvedev said in a radio interview this week, at a time when Russian commanders are expressing growing alarm at the number of NATO warships sailing into the Black Sea, saying that NATO vessels now outnumbered the ships in their fleet anchored off the western coast of Georgia, as the New York Times reports. The White House dismissed as "ridiculous" all assertions that the Pentagon was shipping weapons under what Russian state media call the "guise" of humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, on one side, the leader of the breakaway Georgian territory of Abkhazia said he would invite Russia to establish a naval base there, and on the other, Ukranian President Viktor Yushchenko said he would open negotiations with Moscow on raising the rent on the Russian naval base at Sevastopol, which is in Crimea, a predominantly Russian province of Ukraine. 
"We're not going to twist anyone's arms," Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, after Moscow's efforts to redraw the map of the Caucasus received a frosty reception from China, in what The Wall Street Journal sees as a further sign of how Moscow's conflict with Georgia is scrambling diplomatic alignments in place since the end of the Cold War.

Abstract 
New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, last year issued subpoenas to Xcel and four other energy companies -- AES Corp., Dominion Resources Inc., Dynegy Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. -- citing the 1921 Martin Act that gives his office broad powers to access internal documents of firms doing business in New York, even if the primary relationship is a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Full Text 
Xcel Energy Inc. agreed to expand its disclosures about the possible impact of climate-change and greenhouse-gas legislation on its business in response to a 2007 subpoena from the New York attorney general. 
The settlement is "an effort to create a new model" for climate- change disclosures to investors, said Katherine Kennedy, New York's special deputy attorney general for environmental protection. 
Xcel, a Minneapolis-based energy company, doesn't own any generating plants in New York but it is a major owner of coal-fired plants in other states and is building an additional plant in Colorado, its first such plant in almost three decades. 
New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, last year issued subpoenas to Xcel and four other energy companies -- AES Corp., Dominion Resources Inc., Dynegy Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. -- citing the 1921 Martin Act that gives his office broad powers to access internal documents of firms doing business in New York, even if the primary relationship is a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Several Eastern states have taken steps to discourage production of electricity from coal due to the air pollution that results, which can blow across state boundaries. New York has asserted a right to intervene in coal-plant proposals in other states by arguing that carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere and affects the whole planet. The initial batch of Martin Act subpoenas related to climate change targeted firms with plans to build additional coal plants. 
Under the agreement announced Wednesday, Xcel will beef up its disclosures in annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, there will be a more rigorous analysis of its perceived financial risk from existing laws and possible future laws, its actual and expected emissions levels, mitigation actions and other disclosures. 
The company said that although it is building a big coal-burning power plant near Pueblo, Colo., it has been reducing carbon emissions in recent years and is one of the largest generators of electricity from wind turbines in the U.S. Xcel Chairman Dick Kelly said the firm "plans to continue making significant reductions in CO2 emission." 
The settlement comes amid growing pressure from environmental organizations, state officials and investors to increase disclosures, partly to inform and partly to discourage business activities that worsen the carbon situation. 
Dan Bakal, director of the electric-power program at Ceres, a coalition of investors, public interest and environmental organizations, said the Xcel move "hopefully will raise the bar on disclosure" by other firms. His organization filed a petition with the SEC in September 2007 asking it to require deeper analysis and disclosure of climate-change issues and he said the Xcel action appears to conform to what his group is seeking.

Abstract 
The most glaring omission is the failure to support lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling so states can decide whether to drill off of their coasts, where there are 18 billion barrels of oil and 77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 

Full Text 
Not since the 1980 race between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan has the U.S. energy challenge been more front and center in a presidential campaign. The soaring cost of oil has driven gasoline to all-time highs, squeezing consumers and reviving fears of the country's heavy reliance on imported oil. Soaring energy costs have also muted and complicated the growing concerns over global warning. 
John McCain and Barack Obama have both laid out thick energy plans that overlap in places and sharply differ in others. Both raise the alarm of "foreign oil" and seek to promote new technologies and alternative forms of energy. Sen. McCain's plan puts a heavy emphasis on expanded nuclear power and more offshore drilling, which Sen. Obama opposes unless Congress agrees to a larger energy plan. 
The two also differ on the role of government, with Mr. Obama proposing to spend a whopping $150 billion over 10 years on new technologies and Mr. McCain relying much more on tax incentives and a $300 million competition for development of the ultimate next- generation car battery. 
Wall Street Journal staff reporter Neil King Jr. asked the top energy adviser from each campaign to expand on issues ranging from offshore drilling to global warming and the security of long-term oil supplies. 
John McCarrick, an energy policy adviser for the McCain campaign, previously was in-house counsel for AOL Time Warner and a lawyer at Hogan & Hartson LLP and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP. Mr. McCarrick was also an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
Heather Zichal, the policy director for energy, environment and agriculture for the Obama campaign, previously served as the legislative director to Sen. John Kerry. 
Here are excerpts of their exchanges, which were posted online recently, along with a selection of reader comments. You can see the complete debate -- and offer your own thoughts -- at WSJ.com/Reports. 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: What now is the greater challenge we face on the energy and environmental fronts: the ongoing threat of global climate change, or the basic availability and cost of energy, particularly oil? 
MR. McCARRICK: Sen. John McCain believes that both global climate change and our current energy needs require immediate action. His comprehensive Lexington Project will reduce oil prices, eliminate our dangerous dependence on imported oil, and make the United States a leader in dealing with the global warming crisis. 
Today, energy costs are having a crushing effect on family budgets, with 71% of Americans suffering hardship due to oil costs. Sen. McCain's near-term solutions include opening offshore areas for drilling. 
Sen. McCain believes that climate change requires our immediate action to protect the planet for generations to come. Global warming has occurred over many decades, and will take decades to solve, beginning on day one of a McCain administration. He has long been a proponent of cap-and-trade strategies to address greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Another key component of Sen. McCain's long-term plan includes transforming the types of cars we drive by providing a $5,000 tax incentive for zero-emissions vehicles, a $300 million prize to advance battery technology for vehicles, and promoting the use of hybrids and flex-fuel vehicles. 
MS. ZICHAL: These two challenges cannot be separated. Our dependence on oil is a short-term economic and geopolitical crisis, which is having real and serious impacts on American families today and increasing the risks of a changing climate. The good news is that the solutions to our oil dependence will also help us address the urgent challenge of global climate change. That is why Sen. Barack Obama developed a bipartisan coalition that led the way to the first increases in fuel economy in 30 years. 
Sen. Obama has also proposed a plan to invest $150 billion over the next 10 years in clean-energy technologies like plug in-hybrids and ultralow-carbon alternative fuels that will reduce our dependence on oil, bring energy costs down and help solve the climate crisis. But he also recognizes that Americans need assistance today to help address skyrocketing energy costs, and for that reason has proposed a broad- based tax credit of $500 per person or $1,000 per working family. 
WSJ: What are the most significant flaws or omissions in your opponent's energy plan? 
MR. McCARRICK: Sen. Obama's plan calls for more taxes and more government control of the energy sector while saying "no" to domestic energy supplies. The most glaring omission is the failure to support lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling so states can decide whether to drill off of their coasts, where there are 18 billion barrels of oil and 77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Instead, he wants to rely on unproven energy sources. John McCain understands that securing our energy future depends on a comprehensive strategy that promotes new technologies as well as reliable, proven sources of energy generation. 
Sen. Obama also calls for taxing "excess profits" of oil companies without defining "excess." Raising taxes after the fact will discourage innovation and new exploration because companies never know when their investments might be unexpectedly taxed. This plan was tried by Jimmy Carter and had three undisputable results: (1) actual government revenues were less than a quarter of estimates; (2) the U.S. imported more oil; and (3) domestic production declined. This idea is a recipe for continued high gas prices and dependence on foreign oil and should stay in the history books. 
MS. ZICHAL: John McCain's energy policies do not represent the comprehensive response needed to address our nation's energy challenges. For 26 years in Washington, John McCain has failed to build an energy policy that might have avoided the spiraling energy costs Americans are suffering today. He has also opposed efforts to redirect unnecessary oil company profits to clean energy investments, opposed incentives for renewable energy, opposed tough new vehicle mileage efficiency standards, and has recently begun flip-flopping by opposing real climate change action. 
Barack Obama believes that, like the Apollo Project, we need an R&D effort that's proportionate to the challenges we face and worthy of America's great capacity for innovation. He has proposed a comprehensive plan for new biofuels for transportation; new clean-coal plants that will allow us to use America's vast coal reserves; higher fuel economy standards and new designs for our vehicles; and an aggressive plan to develop renewable energy sources. Barack Obama believes that we should continue to develop our offshore energy resources in the many areas available for drilling -- starting with the 68 million acres already in the oil companies' hands. But he understands that with only 3% of the world's remaining oil reserves, America needs a plan for the future, not just an [outer continental shelf] drilling plan that even the Bush Department of Energy says has zero chance of impacting price or supply. 
WSJ: To continue in this vein, let me ask the Obama campaign this question: You claim that offshore oil exploration won't drive down gas prices now or even for years. But how can you be so sure that there aren't worthwhile amounts of oil off America's shorelines when there has been no meaningful exploration of most of those waters? And why specifically doesn't it make sense for the U.S. to do whatever it can to boost its long-term oil supplies? 
And for the McCain campaign, the U.S. made huge investments to build the Interstate Highway System starting with President Eisenhower or to put a man on the moon starting with President Kennedy. Why would a President McCain oppose a similarly ambitious -- and potentially costly -- government effort to get the U.S. off oil? 
MS. ZICHAL: Sen. Obama recognizes the important role that existing domestic production plays and supports further production on the vast areas that are open for drilling but have yet to be developed. Sen. McCain's plan to allow drilling won't result in a drop of oil for seven years, and by his own account will have mainly a "psychological" impact, but won't affect prices. All current government estimates also indicate that even if we drilled along all of our coastlines we would not produce enough oil to alter global production and reduce prices here at home. As long as we are dependent upon oil, our fate is linked to decisions in other countries. It is time for national leaders to support policies that match our own rhetoric. 
MR. McCARRICK: John McCain's Lexington Project is as comprehensive and ambitious as Apollo but tailored to the reality on the ground. Sen. McCain's plan strongly encourages private-sector advances with the right incentives, like $2 billion a year on clean coal, a prize to advance battery technology, a $5,000 tax credit for an emissions-free vehicle and support for nuclear power. John McCain's vision is grounded in facts while Barack Obama's plan is more taxes and more government. 
I would like to provide a quick response to the Obama team's post about offshore exploration and drilling. This is not the "either/or" decision that they frame -- John McCain is not choosing increased domestic oil production over alternative energy sources, he is offering both to solve our energy problems. 
WSJ: To shift briefly to the bigger climate-change debate, is your candidate willing to sign on to a binding, international post-Kyoto framework that does not include obligations by the big developing countries, especially China and India? And if not, what additional incentives would you be willing to offer to get their full participation? 
MS. ZICHAL: The G-8 recently agreed that global greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050. According to scientists, a reduction of this magnitude will be necessary to prevent global temperature rises that have harmful effects on our economy and society. Sen. Obama recognizes that our global emissions-reduction goals cannot be met without the participation of all major emitting countries. The U.S. and other developed countries must take a leadership role in reducing emissions; Sen. Obama has proposed a domestic cap-and-trade program with strong annual reduction targets, including a 20% reduction by 2020. However, no agreement will be effective unless it includes rapidly developing countries like China, India and Brazil, which now account for the bulk of worldwide emission increases. In an important step, South Africa [recently] announced major new climate goals. 
Sen. Obama will therefore engage with developed and developing countries to create a post-Kyoto agreement under the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change. While the U.S. and other developed countries must take the lead and make binding commitments to significantly reduce emissions, rapidly developing countries must undertake binding actions to reduce and ultimately reverse emissions growth, consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Sen. Obama will support incentives for financing and technology transfer under an international agreement, to support the global transition to a low carbon economy. 
In pursuing international agreements, careful consideration will be given to the need to preserve U.S. jobs in energy-intensive industries and to ensure that both domestic cap­and-trade legislation and an international climate agreement include strong protections for U.S. industrial competitiveness. 
MR. McCARRICK: Sen. McCain will not support a plan that does not include the big developing countries like China and India. Sen. McCain will first lead by example by implementing his cap-and-trade program here in the U.S. He will rally the international community and dramatically increase the United States' involvement in the global effort to confront climate change. Sen. McCain will use diplomatic paths at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to bring China and India along. Sen. McCain will also use our strength in science and technology to offer countries like India and China assistance in the deployment of new clean technologies that America develops, especially clean coal. This is a win-win: the opportunity to provide new clean technologies to China and India while growing our own economy and creating good jobs here. Additional assistance may include financial programs like a clean technology fund. This could assist China and India in reaching national efficiency goals. 
WSJ: Public concern over energy prices is soaring, but the debate in Congress and within the campaign is largely bitter and jeering. What would be the contours of a compromise -- over matters such as offshore drilling and funding for renewables -- that could bridge the differences and move the country forward? 
MR. McCARRICK: If anyone can bridge the gap between the parties and advance groundbreaking energy policies that will move this country forward it is John McCain. From his time as a congressman when he worked with legendary Democrat Mo Udall on environmental issues to his tenure in the Senate where he has worked with Joe Lieberman on climate change and John Kerry on increasing fuel economy standards, John McCain has and will always put the interests of his country first. 
It is clear that members of both parties are already moving toward the American people and Sen. McCain's position that we need an "all of the above" approach to energy that includes nuclear, alternative energy and offshore drilling. We hope Sen. Obama is beginning to realize that his opposition to the realistic energy solutions Sen. McCain has proposed such as drilling and nuclear power is out of step with the views of the American people. 
Addressing environmentally responsible energy requires the right vision, and John McCain has the right ideas, including: investing $2 billion per year on research and deployment of clean coal technologies so we can make use of an abundant domestic resource; restarting our nuclear-energy system so we can reap the benefits of this clean energy for decades; providing incentives to car makers to make cleaner and more fuel-efficient cars; and replacing the patchwork of incentives that we provide for renewable fuels so that all forms of alternative energy can be part of the solution. 
John McCain has the experience to know which ideas will work and which won't. Unlike Sen. Obama, John McCain voted against the Bush/Cheney energy bill in 2005 that gave billions to the oil companies and created the ethanol mandates that are now increasing both food and fuel prices. Barack Obama's plan puts government in charge of research and increases taxes for these massive government- run programs; John McCain will institute result-oriented incentives to encourage the private sector to advance clean energy at minimum costs. The Lexington Project will be supported by both Democrats and Republicans because it offers diverse solutions to our energy crisis. 
MS. ZICHAL: For too long, partisan gridlock and special-interest influence has blocked progress on some of the most urgent challenges facing the American people, and that is especially true when it comes to our energy crisis. The [recent] announcement from the bipartisan "Gang of 10" senators -- which includes many of the policies Sen. Obama has been fighting for during his time in the Senate and over the course of this campaign -- represents a good-faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning. 
This compromise repeals tax breaks to oil companies and makes them pay their fair share; makes serious investments in more efficient automobile technology and renewable energy like wind and solar; and provides immediate relief to consumers in some ways -- all policies Sen. McCain has opposed. 
Like all compromises, it also includes provisions that Sen. Obama hasn't always supported. And while he remains skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term, he does welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future offshore drilling decisions based on science and fact. 
What's important is that we take action to help American consumers. The "Gang of 10" proposal helps us meet that challenge; and as president, Sen. Obama will do even more. 
THE READERS WEIGH IN 
The energy "crisis" should be dealt with as a matter of national security. The environmental issues are a distraction. The public is ready for a long range plan that makes our energy supply secure from foreign whimsy and makes costs more predictable. A transition to renewable sources of electrical power, combined with a move to electric cars, accomplishes both and is cost effective over the long (25 years) haul. The initial expenses are every bit as fundable as the Iraq war. We have a national emergency, let's follow Mr. Bush's example and fund this off budget. At present, neither candidate is proposing a solution to the real problem. They are way behind the voting public on this one. People can deal with high gas prices if they know that a solution is down the road. The discouragement that we see in the polls is the result of high costs, severe weather, and no solution in sight due to governmental paralysis. 
People will make pretty good choices if they have choices to make. Smart meters, smart grid and energy efficiency programs can be facilitated by government, but don't require a huge amount of public subsidy. Allowing people to run dishwashers and clothes dryers at night, at a lower rate, uses the system more efficiently, but it requires new utility tariffs to offer that option and incentive to consumers. Sometimes the really big ideas are too big for the country to digest. Opening up more choices and flexibility will allow consumers to respond correctly. 
Neither candidate's representative seems willing to communicate an inconvenient energy truth to the public: that high energy prices are here to stay. 
Prices will remain volatile, but the trend will generally push higher, in part due to the declining dollar, in part causing the decline of the dollar, but always due to long-term supply constraints that have led us to the front edge of the "peak oil plateau." 
It would be a relief if such honest discourse were to occur prior to an election. However, I don't expect it because U.S. politicians are so loath to speak truth to the voters. They get elected (and re- elected) to dispense sugar, not medicine. 
It is difficult to sort through the fact and fiction of global- warming science. The accuracy of the data, the use of it in computer models, and conclusions made thereon make it nearly impossible for average people to understand. 
We seem to be entering a similar era regarding fact and fiction for assessing oil remaining for use as cheap energy. We can all read articles and reports published on the Internet on this subject. The information is not at all cohesive. Which/whose information should be believed? Our only "crisis" at the moment is with the price of oil, not availability. 
Global warming alarmists seek to force us to develop alternative energy sources using predictions of calamity. 
Opportunists use similar tactics by saying the oil is running out and we must switch to natural gas (or something else). 
Governments having no coherent energy policy are quick to tax us in one way or another as a response to some stated crisis. 
Whether the issue is global warming or alternative energy, the average person is at the mercy of someone's science. I am not optimistic that we will ever know the truth. 
Mostly what I want to hear is that we will not commit to a "global" treaty that China and India have no intention of abiding by either. That national security comes first is a priority with me. No more Kyoto Protocols that nobody is going to follow anyway. 
Actually, global warming is a non-issue. It is a hypothesis, not even a theory. Most of the so-called evidence are proxies. The average temperature recorded every year is even up for grabs. This issue is a political issue not a scientific one. 
Global warming should be ignored and the energy crisis solved by using all energy options. One hundred years from now the citizens will laugh at the climate scare. They will think we were ignorant and superstitious. 
I hope gasoline cost rises to at least $7/gallon. Global warming advocates will be hiding under rocks and trees trying to protect themselves. Having worked in the environmental field for 35 years as an engineer, I simply laugh myself to sleep every night thinking about the sheep going to slaughter for no reason. Wake up. 
Reading the two, McCarrick's argument is the only one that defines a clear and definite solution. Zichal's approach is to attack McCain and say, "Keep doing what we're doing." Problem is: Obama's approach is getting us $4 gasoline and unless proactive measures are taken to address the problem, gas will only go higher. By drilling as McCain suggests, you INCREASE the U.S.'s share of remaining oil reserves by expanding supply and thereby decreasing everybody else's as they continue to drill for their own oil reserves. 
McCain is the only one offering a solution here that WILL reduce our dependence on foreign oil by accessing our own, while Obama just attacks McCain and says essentially that we are stuck. Guess who my vote is going for, and nearly 75% of the nation seems to agree with McCain -- that more drilling in the US is warranted. 
If drilling will help, then why are the oil companies not already drilling on the millions of acres in the US that they already have access to? Makes no sense to open additional areas when they aren't fully utilized what they've already got access to. If all those areas are tapped out, then perhaps we can discuss offshore. 
The comment about drilling on existing leased acreage shows no knowledge of oil and gas exploration. I hope he gets this: Seismic and other evaluation methods of this existing acreage shows high investment risk with little or no promise of oil being found on this acreage. Consequently, oil companies want to use their dollars on acreage that shows through sesmic and other evaluation methods real promise that the probability of oil is present. 
If someone gets cancer by smoking, it would be maddening to prescribe tobacco as a cure. However, that is exactly what we are doing with our fixation on oil. It is the oil, stupid! More drilling will only sustain our addiction. 
We need to emphasize all the alternatives to oil to break this addiction. When an American goes to the pump, there is no competition, there is mainly gasoline and maybe diesel, but we call ourselves the Mecca of capitalism in the Land of the Consumer with No Freedom to Choose. 
The day there are alternatives to gasoline available at the pump, from alternative fuels to natural gas, then the price of gasoline will surely fall as well as our dependence to foreign oil. 
What America needs is a comprehensive energy policy that puts a price on carbon and places greater emphasis on R&D and smart government intervention that works with the markets based on sound economics. Afterwards, the marketplace will react to these incentives by liberating us from the tyranny of oil. 
Does no one else see that if you raise taxes to take away oil companies profits, they will simply raise the price of oil to make up the difference. This is a capitalist society, even though over- regulated. 
It is amazing to me how many people do not understand simple economics. In any industry, when there is too much of something, what happens? Massive sales to get rid of overstocked supplies. When we start drilling and oil supplies go up, I wonder what will happen? When supply increases the demand eases. When the demand eases, what happens to the price? How can anyone who lives in America deny us the opportunity to right our economy, create jobs, and stop lining the pockets of hostile Oil Sheiks. It seems almost unpatriotic to deny domestic drilling. 
Since we don't have a carbon tax, we are indirectly subsidizing the oil companies not only to produce oil but also global warming. The externality (social cost in terms of environmental damage) of oil production and consumption needs to be internalized thru a tax. In fact, the lack of a carbon tax makes all the alternatives to oil less competitive and economically unattractive without subsidies. Therefore, market incentives are currently distorted in favor of oil. Capitalism does not work well when markets don't produce efficient prices. 
Our politicians need to stop the infighting and embrace the art of compromising again. Listen to the wisdom of our economists who in great numbers favor a carbon tax. 
Our politicians need to put the national interest above their narrow party views because our country needs some drilling in exchange for some nuclear power, some subsidies to wind and solar in exchange for some clean coal and if rationality and the national interest prevails, maybe we could also get a boost to energy R&D, massive government investment in a bold Apollo-type program such as building a national hydrogen highway, a prize for batteries and a $5,000 tax credit for zero-emission cars. In other words, a synthesis of the positions of both candidates to allow the country to move forward. I hope the candidates are smart enough to see the value in the policy proposals of the opposition and copy them if they win.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
Three weeks ago The Wall Street Journal kicked off a debate on how best to allocate scarce resources to solve the world's problems. Bjorn Lomborg offered a summary of the latest findings from his Copenhagen Consensus project, where he has enlisted some of the world's top economists to address the issue. Now we're offering views on the subject from top political and business leaders. How would you spend $10 billion of American resources (either directly or through regulation) over the next four years to help improve the state of the world? 
Teach Them How to Fish 
By Sidney Taurel 
In contemplating ways to spend $10 billion to realize the greatest gain for humanity, the key questions obviously are "Where?" and "How?" But allow me to suggest that our 
goal should be to create programs that are sustainable and to leverage the investment of billions of dollars into billions more -- regardless of the issue addressed. 
Here's where I believe we can accomplish the greatest good: fighting infectious diseases that ravage the developing countries and increasingly threaten the developed ones. 
Infectious diseases are the world's second-leading cause of death. Just three diseases -- malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS -- together kill nearly six million people a year, 

mostly in developing countries. This is roughly equivalent to the population of metropolitan Chicago. And, if these diseases are not properly treated, resistant strains emerge 

that threaten everyone regardless of where we live. 
Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs makes a compelling case that disease devastates not only individuals and families. Societies and economies also suffer in lost 
potential and costs of care. That's why each dollar spent to ensure that people are healthier and more productive can yield a 20-fold benefit. 

So, if infectious diseases are the targets, how should we invest our $10 billion? 
I recommend we follow the wisdom of the Chinese proverb: "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." 
I would invest half of the $10 billion in comprehensive treatment programs that could be sustained by the countries with high incidence of the above diseases, and which have 

leaders committed to long-term solutions. 

I'd begin by ensuring that effective existing medicines are made available to the countries at low cost. Fortunately, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated with generic drugs -- which can be complemented by the antiretroviral and other critical medicines pharmaceutical companies are providing at deeply discounted prices. In addition, to reinforce the programs' sustainability, I would transfer to local companies the technology and know-how so they themselves can manufacture the medicines that 
are already off-patent. 
Medicines are effective only if they are used properly, however. So we must also take a comprehensive public-health approach and train doctors, nurses and ultimately patients 

to ensure short-term compliance with treatment regimes and, more broadly, slow the spread of disease. We should leverage existing organizations -- like the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies -- for this purpose. I know this approach can work because for the past five years Lilly and 14 partners on five continents have been using it to combat a growing and virulent form of tuberculosis ­
- multidrug-resistant TB. 
The progress we're starting to see -- in treating patients, improving manufacturing standards, and supporting local economies -- tells me such an approach could be adapted for 
an array of infectious diseases and supported by the countries most affected. 
However, because the bugs that cause these diseases continually evolve and new strains emerge, any long-term solution requires another critical component: ongoing research. 
I would use the remaining half of the $10 billion to foster investment in research, and I'd leverage it as I would the treatment programs -- by working to make it sustainable. 
The problem is that there are no market incentives for research in infectious diseases of the developing world. 
I would take the lessons learned from President Bush's BioShield experiments (which aimed to create an artificial market to attract biotech and pharmaceutical companies to 

develop medicines to counter a biological attack), and offer a guaranteed sum for whoever gets to a research-based solution first. This should attract competing programs and generate added investment by those pursuing novel treatments and cures for infectious diseases. 
I believe the benefits from these proposals would expand like ripples across a pond -- bringing new energy and insights to the stubborn diseases that threaten all of us, and providing health and hope to millions of the world's neediest citizens who desperately need help now. 
Mr. Taurel is chairman of Eli Lilly & Co. 
Let's Invest in Clean Energy 
By Steny Hoyer 
How would I spend a hypothetical $10 billion? I can't help noting, at the outset, that it's not just a question of priorities. It's also a question of fiscal responsibility. After all, President Bush managed to turn a projected $5.6 trillion budget surplus into a projected $4 trillion deficit in less than eight years. So unless we're willing to make some tough fiscal choices, the money we're talking about will have to remain highly hypothetical. 
But if I had the cash on hand, and had to choose from the list of worthy causes, I'd focus on one issue: energy. 
A dramatic investment in clean energy would be the most effective check on aggressive petroregimes from Moscow to Tehran. It would be the best long-term solution to global warming. And energy independence is the most effective step we can take for American families staggering under the burden of high gas prices. 
That's because the forces that have produced this summer's record prices are not going away. We are facing skyrocketing world demand for an ever-shrinking quantity of oil, and unless Congress figures out a way to amend the laws of supply and demand, that fundamental fact is not going to change. This is a large-scale problem, and it's going to take large-scale solutions. 
One of those solutions is using America's resources for America. Right now, 311 million acres of public land are available for oil leasing. Of those, the oil companies are sitting idle on 68 million acres, including 33 million on the Outer Continental Shelf. Republicans seem incapable of acknowledging that those 68 million acres are already leased, yet completely undrilled. The public wants drilling on that land, and Democrats agree. 
But ultimately, we are still consuming nearly a quarter of the world's oil while, according to the Oil and Gas Journal, we are sitting on just 1.6% of the total world supply. Even with more domestic production, there's only one lasting solution: find new sources of energy, and use the energy we already have more intelligently. 
There, the difference between the two parties is stark. Republicans voted against more fuel efficient cars, against lower fares to boost public-transit ridership, and against renewable energy research. Democrats, on the other hand, raised the gas mileage standard for the first time in more than three decades, increased production of homegrown biofuels, supported efforts to develop the next generation of vehicles, and launched a comprehensive advanced energy research program. 
With $10 billion, we could give that work a massive push. Government-sponsored research has an excellent track record; the defense research agency DARPA, for instance, has sparked the development of GPS, the computer mouse, the Saturn rocket engine, the Predator drone and computer-aided design -- not to mention the Internet. 
The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, and other government-sponsored researchers, are now doing the same thing for clean technologies. Over the past 10 years, the federal government has been spending an average of a little less than $1 billion per year on energy research. An extra $10 billion infusion would allow us to double those efforts for a decade. 
Imagine the effect on our economy if we mastered cutting-edge technologies like these, not just for our own consumption, but for export to the world: hydrogen-powered vehicles; fuel cells; plug-in hybrids; new nuclear technology, for safe, carbon-neutral plants; carbon sequestration, which would let us keep relying on coal, while storing emissions in the ground. 
These, and other promising solutions, are hardly space-age endeavors; most of the science already exists. The difficulty lies in achieving economies of scale and cost-effectiveness, but it's exactly there that government support could make the difference. 
We could also use the money to support existing clean technologies. We could extend tax credits for renewable-energy electricity and solar projects, help local governments issue bonds for renewable energy construction, and preserve incentives for homeowners to install solar panels, small windmills, geothermal heat pumps, and fuel cells on their property. 
It would be worth every penny. So much is at stake when it comes to clean energy, beginning with lower gas prices and a healthier planet for our children. Global leadership is at stake, too. In the 21st century, it will take more than an accident of geography to be a world energy leader: It will take innovation, ingenuity, and smart investment. With the right choices today, we can earn that role for generations to come. 
Mr. Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, is House majority leader.

In his coming book, "The First Billion is the Hardest," oilman T. Boone Pickens provides a series of vignettes that he believes reflect key turning points -- defeats and triumphs -­in his business career. 
Mr. Pickens, who today is the chief executive of BP Capital, a Dallas-based hedge fund, also has a message about the U.S.'s reliance on foreign oil. He wants the U.S. to cut back on imports and invest aggressively in renewable energy resources, particularly wind power. In May, his Mesa Power LLP placed a $2 billion order for wind turbines. 
The 80-year-old Mr. Pickens started out as a geologist at Phillips Petroleum. Before he quit in 1954, he was supporting his wife and two children on $500 a month, which he describes "as a pretty good salary" at the time. At the age of 26, he bought a station wagon and went into business as a consultant. 
Two years later, he and several investors formed an oil company that evolved into Mesa Petroleum, which eventually became one of the largest independent oil companies in the 
U.S. 
Excerpts from an interview: 
The Wall Street Journal: BP Capital invests in the commodity markets. Do speculators play a constructive role? 
Mr. Pickens: When you look at a commodities market you need hedgers and speculators. If you don't have one, you don't have a market. That's how it works. I don't think speculators are destructive. They are an infinitesimal part of the market. Fundamentals make the market. I'm amused when Congress tries to place the blame on somebody but never themselves. I've never heard any of them ever say, "I've made a mistake." I do. I say I called it wrong. But they just try to find somebody to blame. 
WSJ: You've become a representative for renewable energy, which seems odd for an oilman. Did you have a conversion? 
Mr. Pickens: It's not a conversion. It's a necessity to save the country. The hydrocarbon era is shutting down in the U.S. We peaked at 10 million barrels produced in 1970; today it's 5 million barrels. We are fading. If you are going out of business you don't go down with the ship, you get another ship. For us it's natural gas. We never felt our back was against the wall. We didn't know it because our leadership didn't tell us. Now we're placing blame. But what we should have done is closed the door and said, how do we get out of this trap? 
WSJ: What are your views on lifting the federal moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and gas? 
Mr. Pickens: I'm for drilling every place. And I'm for nuclear, and I'm for ethanol, because it means another one million barrels we don't have to import. I'm for anything American. I'm opposed to only one thing: foreign oil. Heck yes, drill. There is nothing wrong with drilling. We haven't had an oil spill in 20 years. If you don't like the appearance of rigs, don't look. 
WSJ: How can the U.S. lower the amount of gasoline, and therefore imported oil, it uses? 
Mr. Pickens: The answer is natural gas. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of natural gas. It's cleaner, cheaper, and it's ours. How could we ever have imported so much oil when we have so much natural gas? The answer is we didn't have leadership. We have 142,000 natural- gas-powered vehicles, mostly trucks. We sit here like dumb-dumbs. We have plenty of natural gas. 
WSJ: You argue that coal is the immediate answer to our energy needs. Won't more coal-fired power mean more global-warming gases? 
Mr. Pickens: No question about it. But you can clean it up. The coal is ours. I'd rather use our finite resources than somebody else's. 
WSJ: You're promoting the Pickens Plan, a blueprint for a dramatic change in the U.S. energy landscape. Do you see any politicians or companies embracing new energy policies that make sense? 
Mr. Pickens: There's no policy. We have 250 million vehicles in America. We have got to make some changes. The government must come out and say all government vehicles in the future will use natural gas. You can revitalize our economy, our transportation system, and create an energy system in 10 years that would be the best in the world. Instead, we're importing oil that will be $300 a barrel in 10 years.

Full Text 
In his upcoming book, "The First Billion is the Hardest," oilman T. Boone Pickens provides a series of chatty vignettes that he believes reflects key turning points in his business career -- defeats as well as triumphs. 
Mr. Pickens, who today is the chief executive of BP Capital, a Dallas-based hedge fund, also has a serious message about energy and the U.S.'s increasing reliance on foreign oil. He wants the U.S. to cut back on imports and to aggressively invest in renewable energy resources, particularly wind power. In May, his Mesa Power LLP placed a $2 billion order for wind turbines. 
But Mr. Pickens also likes a good story. While explaining to an audience why he once made a bid for a much larger company, Mr. Pickens told the following joke to illustrate his point that money changes everything: A man walks into a bar with a talking dog. The barman is amazed, and eventually gives the pooch a dollar to buy him a newspaper down the block. When he doesn't return, the owner finds his dog canoodling with a poodle. After the owner expresses dismay, the dog replies: "This is the first time I've had money." 
It's easy to forget that Mr. Pickens started out as a geologist at Phillips Petroleum. Before he quit in 1954, he was supporting his wife and two kids on $500 a month, which he describes "as a pretty good salary" at the time. At the age of 26, he bought a station wagon and went into business as a consultant. Two years later, he and several investors formed an oil company that evolved into Mesa Petroleum, which eventually became one of the largest independent oil companies in the U.S. Mr. Pickens, 80 years old, was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal's Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg. 
The Wall Street Journal: What prompted this book? 
T. Boone Pickens: I felt like a lot had happened to me. I left Mesa [Petroleum] in 1996 and the 12 years that followed were the most productive years of my life. Also, I came from a small town in eastern Oklahoma, and I think that I can still reach a young audience who want to know that average intelligence and a good work ethic is all you need. 
WSJ: You were in effect fired as CEO of Mesa Petroleum by Richard Rainwater and his wife Darla Moore in 1996. In this book, you settle scores with them, adding the occasional shot to the ribs. What about forgetting and forgiving? 
Mr. Pickens: If somebody I don't like gets in the crosshairs, I pull the trigger. But I don't hunt for them. The reason for paying them back is that they couldn't make a professional transition. You want your departure after 40 years to be pleasant, not unpleasant. They did things that were totally unnecessary, so that's why I said what I said. 
WSJ: BP Capital has done well in the commodity markets. Do speculators play a constructive role? 
Mr. Pickens: When you look at a commodities market you need hedgers and speculators. If you don't have one, you don't have a market. That's how it works. I don't think speculators are destructive. They are an infinitesimal part of the market. Fundamentals make the market. I'm amused when Congress tries to place the blame on somebody but never themselves. I've never heard any of them ever say, "I've made a mistake." I do. I say I called it wrong. But they just try to find somebody to blame. Now they are blaming speculators. Surely they have more to do than that. We don't focus on the problem in Washington. 
WSJ: You often stop in your book to remind readers that you came from a modest background, with a grandmother who cut a smart deal with you to mow lawns for only a dime. Was she really that tough? 
Mr. Pickens: Oh yes. She said at one point, "I'm going to help you out on a bad deal," and I thought she was going to raise the price. Instead she offered to have the mower sharpened. She taught me lessons I've never forgotten. She said that the next time I made a contract, I would spend more time figuring out the costs. And it was absolutely true. 
WSJ: You've become a representative for renewable energy, which seems odd for an oilman. Did you have a conversion? 
Mr. Pickens: It's not a conversion. It's a necessity to save the country. The hydrocarbon era is shutting down in the U.S. We peaked at 10 million barrels produced in 1970; today it's 5 million barrels. We are fading. If you are going out of business you don't go down with the ship, you get another ship. For us it's natural gas. We never felt our back was against the wall. We didn't know it because our leadership didn't tell us. And we didn't feel it because we had cheap oil. It was: Send it to us, never mind the price. Then one day it went vertical and people began screaming. Now we're placing blame. But what we should have done is closed the door and said, how do we get out of this trap? Oil is in decline, coal is dirty, and down the list you go. Circle the ones that will reduce what we're paying for foreign oil. Natural gas, do we have enough? Yes. Why not use it? No leadership. 
WSJ: What are your views on lifting the federal moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and gas? 
Mr. Pickens: I'm for drilling every place. And I'm for nuclear, and I'm for ethanol, because it means another one million barrels we don't have to import. I'm for anything American. I'm opposed to only one thing: foreign oil. Heck yes, drill. There is nothing wrong with drilling. We haven't had an oil spill in 20 years. If you don't like the appearance of rigs don't look. 
WSJ: How can the U.S. lower the amount of gasoline, and therefore imported oil, it uses? 
Mr. Pickens: Only one way quickly. You have to change the fuel. If you don't have the oil, what can you use to reduce imports? The answer is natural gas. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of natural gas. It's cleaner, cheaper, and it's ours. How could we ever have imported so much oil when we have so much natural gas? The answer is we didn't have leadership. We have 142,000 natural-gas-powered vehicles, mostly trucks. We sit here like dumb-dumbs. We have plenty of natural gas. 
WSJ: You argue that coal is the immediate answer to our energy needs. Won't more coal-fired power mean more global-warming gases? 
Mr. Pickens: No question about it. But you can clean it up. The coal is ours. That's a resource we have available. We can't keep importing oil. I'd rather use our finite resources than somebody else's. And natural gas will be a bridge to the next generation of transportation fuel. Right now we have nothing. 
WSJ: You're promoting the Pickens Plan, a blueprint for a dramatic change in the U.S. energy landscape. Do you see any politicians or companies embracing new energy policies that make sense? 
Mr. Pickens: There's no policy. We have 250 million vehicles in America. We have got to make some changes. The government must come out and say all government vehicles in the future will use natural gas. You can revitalize our economy, our transportation system, and create an energy system in 10 years that would be the best in the world. Instead, we're importing oil that will be $300 a barrel in 10 years.

Abstract 
The push comes as gas producers, emboldened by a windfall in domestic production, press federal lawmakers to help expand the market for gas as a means for reducing dependence on foreign oil and cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. 

Full Text 
The notion of spending taxpayers' money to help fill U.S. roads with natural-gas-fueled vehicles faces a major test when voters in California, the nation's largest auto market, go to the polls in November. 
Natural-gas providers are spending millions of dollars on advertising to persuade Californians to pass a ballot initiative allowing the state government to invest in the now-tiny market for natural-gas-fueled cars and trucks. The push comes as gas producers, emboldened by a windfall in domestic production, press federal lawmakers to help expand the market for gas as a means for reducing dependence on foreign oil and cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. 
If the California ballot initiative passes, as many as a million vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas, or CNG, could ultimately end up on the state's roads. If the proposal -­called Proposition 10 -- fails, backers will face a tougher task selling authorities on the wisdom of investing in infrastructure for natural-gas-fueled vehicles instead of spending on biofuels or electric cars and trucks. 
"Natural gas is on the menu of possible fuels for the future," said Jim Boyd, a member of the California Energy Commission. "Its carbon footprint isn't as good as totally noncarbon fuels. But as we transition to alternative fuels, there could be a pathway to a future that includes natural gas for a while." 
No opposition has been organized against the proposal, which would authorize the state to sell $5 billion in bonds to fund rebates of $2,000 to $50,000 to people who purchase natural-gas-powered cars and trucks. Some of the money would be earmarked for research, development and production of renewable-energy technology and education. The plan would cost the state $9.8 billion over 30 years. 
Scientists and policy makers say that filling the tank with natural gas instead of gasoline or diesel could serve as a stopgap to cut greenhouse gases and dependence on foreign oil but that it isn't ideal for the long term and shouldn't be heavily subsidized. 
"Using natural gas has some small advantages," said Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Davis and a member of the California Air Resources Board. "If someone can make a business out of it, that's great. The public benefits are rather small, so I don't think . . . our government should put much effort into promoting it." 
Among the most prominent backers of the Proposition 10 is Texas billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens, who is founder and chairman of CNG provider Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Mr. Pickens and Chesapeake Energy Corp. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon have contributed a total of $3.7 million to support Proposition 10. 
Messrs. Pickens and McClendon testified before Congress in the past two weeks, pressing lawmakers for a bigger role for natural gas in the nation's fuel supply amid booming production from the Barnett Shale in Texas and the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and East Texas. 
The executives had already gotten the attention of Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D., Ill.), who introduced a bill that would provide tax credits for the purchase of natural-gas vehicles and home-refueling systems, as well as to encourage gas stations to install natural-gas pumps. 
Although CNG has been around for more than 20 years, it is a small market. About 0.1% of the 23 trillion cubic feet of natural gas the U.S. consumed last year was used to fuel vehicles, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Honda Motor Co. manufactures the only natural-gas-fueled car available in the U.S., the Civic GX, while several companies sell conversion kits, costing about $3,700 to $5,500, to modify gasoline engines to run on CNG. 
One thing natural gas has going for it politically is that it is a lot cheaper than gasoline. Retail CNG prices in California are about $2.50 to $3 a gallon. The average price of retail gasoline in California is about $4.20 a gallon. 
CNG proponents also point to the benefits that switching to a natural-gas-heavy vehicle fleet can bring in shoring up the nation's energy security. Big U.S. natural-gas discoveries and forecasts for larger reserves have emerged just as oil and gasoline prices have skyrocketed, forcing energy issues onto the front pages and into the speeches of the presidential candidates. 
A report released last week by the Chesapeake-backed industry group American Clean Skies Foundation and Navigant Consulting Inc. estimated that U.S. natural-gas reserves could be as large as 2,247 trillion cubic feet, or nearly 100 times the current U.S. annual demand. 
"If we started moving to natural-gas vehicles in large numbers, even if we didn't go to renewables, we'd have plenty of natural gas," said Rich Kolodziej, president of Natural Gas Vehicles for America, a Washington trade association. 
The industry's goal is to replace 20% of the diesel used in the U.S. -- about 10 billion gallons, or 1.3 billion cubic feet -- with natural gas by 2025, Mr. Kolodziej said. 
Mr. Pickens, Chesapeake and other backers are keen to see Proposition 10 pass because they otherwise would have to compete against other alternative-fuel providers for about $840 million California plans to hand out for development and deployment of alternative fuels under a law called AB 118. 
While natural gas is more environmentally friendly than gasoline and diesel, its advantages have diminished since the 1980s, when engines were less efficient and petroleum fuels were dirtier, said the University of California's Mr. Sperling. 
Automobile-pollution controls have improved since then, and California requires car and truck engines to become more efficient in the near term, making natural gas less competitive as a cleaner- burning fuel. 
A study by the California Energy Commission found that using natural gas instead of gasoline reduced global-warming pollution 20% to 30%. Swapping natural gas with diesel in heavy-duty trucks cut greenhouse- gas emissions 10% to 20%, according to the study, which examined the "life cycle" of the fuels, from wellhead to gas processor to delivery point to combustion. 
Natural gas used to be viewed as a good alternative to diesel in heavy-duty trucks, but this has changed as new truck engines have become much more efficient, and as refiners have produced cleaner- burning diesels, said Patricia Monahan, deputy director for clean vehicles at the Union of Concerned Scientists in San Francisco. 
"The jury is out as to which is cleaner," Ms. Monahan said, referring to natural gas compared with diesel. She added that natural gas is best used to replace coal for power generation and that alternative vehicles running on solar-generated electricity, renewable diesel or fuel cells would be superior to those fueled by natural gas. 
"You have to do a big calculation about what's the best use for the fuel," Ms. Monahan said. "Ultimately we'd like to see zero-emission vehicles on the road -- fuel-cell vehicles or electric vehicles powered by renewable energy."

More U.S. corporate boards are going green. 
Amid rising investor worries over global warming and shrinking natural resources, directors are keeping a closer watch on environmental issues. Boards at Integrys Energy Group Inc., Quicksilver Resources Inc., Tesoro Corp. and elsewhere recently have created separate environmental panels -- joining long-established ones at DuPont Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Rohm & Haas Co. Other companies cover environmental issues with an existing board committee. 
About 25% of Fortune 500 companies now have a board committee overseeing the environment, compared with fewer than 10% five years ago, estimates Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a national coalition of activists, investors and others concerned with the environment. Such panels typically try to make sure that executives effectively handle conservation efforts, new environmentally friendly ventures like wind power, compliance with environmental regulations and related business risks. 
Shareholders are more active on environmental issues, too. The number of investor proposals related to the environment nearly doubled between 2004 and 2008, RiskMetrics Group Inc. says. Many proposals urge increased board attention to the issue. 
The Earth's sustainability "has become a much more important part of every board's activities," observes Lester A. Hudson, chairman of American Electric Power Co.'s governance committee, which monitors environmental concerns. 
AEP's experience illustrates the new dynamic. The electric utility, based in Columbus, Ohio, is among the largest U.S. users of coal -- and emitters of greenhouse gases. 
In November 2003, public-employee pension funds offered a shareholder resolution urging independent directors to assess how AEP would deal with potential regulations to reduce carbon dioxide and other power-plant emissions. Mr. Hudson says three fellow directors formed a special panel to do a study, prompting the unions to drop their proposal. 
The board members prepared an analysis following interviews with nearly 30 investors, environmentalists, experts, analysts and regulators. Their August 2004 report concluded that pending legislation likely wouldn't impact AEP's plan to invest $3.5 billion in cleaner coal-burning technologies by 2010. But the directors noted that AEP might want to consider scaling back plans for another $1.5 billion beyond that, because laws by that time might limit the use of coal altogether. 
The study was a first for U.S. utilities, says Denise Nappier, treasurer for the state of Connecticut, which sponsored the 2003 resolution. 
In 2006, Ceres gave AEP the highest U.S. ranking for board involvement in climate change, among 100 global businesses studied. That same year, AEP directors gave their governance committee oversight of its sustainability initiatives. 
The panel now receives updates twice a year from Chief Executive Michael G. Morris and critiques drafts of his annual sustainability report. In the 2008 report, Mr. Hudson wrote that the board applauded AEP's progress on offsetting growth in greenhouse-gas emissions, but "expects and requires higher performance in the future." 
AEP directors also tightened environmental-performance targets that employees must meet to receive annual bonuses. In 2006, they docked $80,045 from Mr. Morris' targeted $2 million bonus, after AEP received nine notices of possible environmental regulatory violations; the goal had been no more than five. Last year, the target dropped to four, and AEP received only two such notices. Businesses rarely link management rewards to environmental performance, according to Ceres. 
Board committees responsible for environmental affairs elsewhere are turning up the heat, too. Steven Kline, chief environmental officer of PG&E Corp., told the board's public-policy panel in June about plans to lower the company's water consumption over several years -- without promising a timetable. 
They replied, "That's great. But let's see if we can do it faster," Mr. Kline recalls. He hopes to offer a water-reduction schedule for the energy holding company when the panel convenes again in October. 
But focusing board committees on the environment doesn't ensure eco- friendly behavior, activists say, citing Exxon Mobil Corp. The oil giant formed a public issues and contributions panel to monitor safety, health and the environment immediately after its Valdez oil spill in 1989. 
The committee's efforts have been "more window dressing than anything else," contends Ms. Lubber. She says the company reduced oil spills, but its climate-change performance "is disappointing" -- partly because it lacks a comprehensive strategy for lowering greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Exxon takes climate change seriously and has invested more than $1.5 billion to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions since 2004, says spokesman Tony Cudmore. 
Ms. Lubber also faults Exxon directors for rejecting investor requests during the past five years to talk face-to-face about environmental problems. W.V. Shipley, head of a board committee that handles corporate governance, wrote Ceres last year that directors prefer senior executives to hold such sessions. Mr. Shipley declined to comment for this article. 
In another sign of investor dissatisfaction, seven environmental resolutions came to a vote at Exxon's annual meeting in May. One proposal asked Exxon to set specific goals for greenhouse-gas emissions; it drew 30.9% of votes cast.

Abstract 
Following that, a side trip to Iowa where, as national co-chair for Sen. McCain's presidential campaign, he passed out tire gauges as a way of poking fun at Barack Obama's suggestion the energy crisis be addressed by having Americans better inflate their cars. 

Full Text 
Being on John McCain's short list for vice president makes Tim Pawlenty a busy guy. 
One day last week began with a meeting on security for the upcoming Republican convention in St. Paul, Minn., where Gov. Pawlenty will play host. Then it was off to Farmfest, the state's biggest agricultural fair. Following that, a side trip to Iowa where, as national co-chair for Sen. McCain's presidential campaign, he passed out tire gauges as a way of poking fun at Barack Obama's suggestion the energy crisis be addressed by having Americans better inflate their cars. 
The next day it was off to Washington, D.C., for a speech to GOPAC, a grass-roots conservative training academy, meetings with reporters, and a nationally televised speech at the National Press Club. If there is such a thing as campaigning to become somebody's vice president, Mr. Pawlenty is doing a good job in the auditions. 
Not that he will countenance discussion of the subject. At the Press Club, he is asked what the most important qualities a vice presidential candidate should have. "Discretion," he quickly said and then sat down. But Mr. Pawlenty was anything but discrete about his vision for the Republican Party when I caught up with him recently in Colorado Springs, Colo., as he spoke to a group of business leaders and their families. 
"I'm the son of a truck driver and a housewife from a meatpacking town," he introduced himself, "who wants to provide a better quality of life for ordinary folks without growing government." His audience stirred: This was clearly a different sales pitch than they were used to. "We must be the party of Sam's Club Republicans, not just country club Republicans," he continued. 
In 2002, Mr. Pawlenty invented the term "Sam's Club Republicans" to describe the voters he fears the party is losing. They most likely didn't graduate from college, often hold socially conservative views, struggle to make ends meet, and want a government that delivers real value for their tax dollars and programs that make their lives a little easier without "getting in their face." These swing voters are key to reviving the GOP, which lost independents by 18 points in 2006. 
While Mr. Pawlenty tiptoes around the Bush political legacy, he allows that the party's years in power left it with a "name brand a little damaged and out of fresh ideas." Merely retreating to Reagan nostalgia won't do. "I love Ronald Reagan," says Mr. Pawlenty, who at age 47 came of age during the Reagan years. "But we have to recognize that to voters younger than me he is an historical figure." 
I ask him later what lessons he imbibed from Reagan. "He was proudly conservative," he replies, "but we sometimes forget he got things done as governor and president that represented compromises. If today you went to someone and outlined Reagan's record without using his name some conservatives would want to throw him out of the party. But he never wavered on core principles and he made the country a better and more conservative place." 
Mr. Pawlenty wants people to see him in that light. Minnesota, he's quick to note, is the only state that hasn't voted Republican for president in the last eight elections. But he has won statewide twice in that chilly environment, and currently sports an approval rating of 56%. 
Since he took office in 2003, at least one house of the legislature has been controlled by Democrats. Currently, they enjoy near veto- proof majorities in both houses. In the last legislative session, Mr. Pawlenty set a record by vetoing some 70 bills and was only overridden once -- on a gas-tax increase pushed through in the wake of last year's bridge collapse in Minneapolis. 
But Mr. Pawlenty says his record is more than just stopping bad ideas. He believes he has stood by the no-new-taxes pledge he took as a candidate, despite having signed a cigarette tax hike that he claimed (and state courts later agreed) was "a health impact fee." He now says the levy "was a bad idea" but notes that it was a way to solve a nine-day government shutdown: "We blocked a lot of other taxes by holding fast everywhere else." 
Gov. Pawlenty's tenure can be divided into two parts. In 2003, he roared into office facing a huge budget deficit which he closed by passing a no-growth budget. He signed laws establishing a 24-hour waiting period for abortions, tax-exempt zones for depressed rural areas, and allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons. 
After his party lost seats in the 2004 election, he pivoted in a populist direction. He reversed course to back taxpayer funding for new sports stadiums, called for government health insurance to cover all children, and embraced ethanol mandates. He also backed requiring 25% of electricity be produced by renewable fuels by 2025. 
But nothing riled conservatives as much as his support for a regional cap-and-trade approach to global warming, which would require companies to pay for the right to make carbon emissions. Mr. McCain also favors cap-and-trade. 
Today, in the wake of the U.S. Senate's June failure to pass a cap- and-trade bill, he sounds a tad defensive about his views. "Climate change is occurring in large measure because of natural cycles, but some portion is due to human behavior," he says. "Whatever we ultimately do about it shouldn't imperil the economy or cut back on our ability to produce jobs." While that may not be completely coherent, it demonstrates just how much $4 a gallon gasoline has changed the environmental debate. 
Mr. Pawlenty agrees with Mr. McCain's support for more domestic oil exploration; he says he can live with the candidate's opposition to government subsidies or tax credits for the next generation of alternative fuels. His own state government isn't standing in the way of a proposed new coal-based power plant, and Mr. Pawlenty supports nuclear energy. 
On health care, Mr. Pawlenty says, "We have to dramatically realign health care so patients and doctors are in charge, not government or insurance bureaucrats." He acknowledges his state could do a better job policing its own health-care program for children, which has become crowded with adults taking advantage of it. This past February, a health-care task force he appointed supported a requirement that everyone in the state buy health coverage, a la Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. Mr. Pawlenty rejected it, saying that a mandate would simply fine or impose criminal penalties on low-income people who can't pay for insurance. 
Mr. Pawlenty's blue-collar roots inform his personal beliefs, as well as his political sense that Republicans have no future without making more inroads among working families. He grew up in gritty South St. Paul, his boyhood filled with hockey, fishing and hunting. He became an avid fan of rock music -- leaning towards Van Morrison and Tom Petty. 
But he also became the first member of his family to graduate from college. After law school he was a prosecutor. By age 33, he had made partner at a local law firm and been elected to the state House. In 1999, he became his party's majority leader. The next year he became vice president of a local computer technology firm at the height of the Internet bubble. He told the business leaders in Colorado it was a humbling experience to watch a firm of great promise sink. "You need a business plan that provides access to capital and responds to marketplace needs and sharp competition," he says. "I learned a lot about the private sector." 
Mr. Pawlenty's easy self-confidence is smoothed over by a hefty helping of Minnesota Nice, the impeccably polite manners of most state natives. "He's a very likable fellow," said GOPAC chairman Michael Steele after Mr. Pawlenty spoke to his group this week. "I think he'd make a great accompaniment to John McCain." Indeed, in many respects Tim Pawlenty could be the ideological son of John McCain, albeit without his combative nature. 
"If he had his druthers he'd always do the conservative thing," says David Strom of the Minnesota Free Market Institute. "But if it's a choice between something conservative and something really popular he'll often go with the latter." Despite this tart observation, Mr. Strom is in awe of his governor's political skills. "He's a natural. I'd give him an A-minus for navigating Minnesota's political waters. On issues, I'd give him a B-minus or C-plus, but I'm a tough grader." 
Phil Krinkie, a former conservative state legislator who now runs the Taxpayers League of Minnesota, says Mr. Pawlenty "is about the most conservative governor this state could elect. There's an old joke that a Republican in Minnesota couldn't get elected as a Democrat in Mississippi." 
In political terms, what would Mr. Pawlenty bring to the McCain campaign? His most important asset would be that he is someone Mr. McCain genuinely likes and trusts -- a wingman he could count on not to upstage him or make rookie mistakes. Mr. Pawlenty lacks foreign policy experience, but is comfortable with the candidate's positions: "The surge in Iraq worked, and John McCain was one of the first to call for it," he told his Colorado audience. 
Electorally, there's a chance Minnesota could be in play this fall -- Mr. Bush lost it by less than four points twice. Because of the Minneapolis media market, Mr. Pawlenty is also well known in parts of neighboring Iowa and Wisconsin, two of the closest states in both 2000 and 2004. 
The candidate for vice president may not be crucial for either John McCain or Barack Obama, since the vast majority of voters focus on the top-of-the-ticket. But Republicans need to pay attention: Should Mr. McCain become president at age 72, his No. 2 will be a likely contender for a future presidential nomination. "Selections have consequences," notes David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Ronald Reagan's choice of George H.W. Bush in 1980 "meant we wound up with two Bushes in the White House." 
Tim Pawlenty is not every conservative's dream of a leader. But in a time when the party's market share is perilously low, he has a proven record of success in a tough state, and has many more political hits than strikeouts in his record. 
"He's thought a lot about the country's political future and how to adapt conservatism to changing demographics and pressures," says Minnesota GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachman, who sometimes tangled with Gov. Pawlenty when she was in the state legislature. She notes his ability to move with equal ease between business audiences and evangelicals like herself. 
I might add that those national media figures who lie in wait hoping to sandbag new Republicans on the national stage will have a hard time with the smooth and fluent Mr. Pawlenty. "Sam Club's Republicanism" may be partly a marketing tool. But it will probably play better with voters leery of the GOP than "compassionate conservatism" ever did.

Abstract 
If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) would allow a vote on our comprehensive energy plan -- a vote House Republicans and hundreds of Americans demanded on the House floor this past Friday, after Congress adjourned, in a historic revolt -- we could create more American jobs, reduce America's energy dependence on nations with ties to global terrorism, cut emissions to promote a healthy environment, and raise our quality of life. [...] the Congressional Research Service estimates that at $100 per barrel (far below today's price), producing the estimated 10 billion barrels of oil in Alaska's remote Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would generate $153 billion in new federal revenues.

Last Monday The Wall Street Journal kicked off a debate on how best to allocate scarce resources to solve the world's problems. Bjorn Lomborg offered a summary of the latest findings from his Copenhagen Consensus project, where he has enlisted some of the world's top economists to address the issue. (Please go to OpinionJournal.com to offer your own views.) Over the next few Mondays we'll offer views on the subject from top political and business leaders. How would you spend $10 billion of American resources (either directly or through regulation) over the next four years to help improve the state of the world? 
Unleashing America's Ingenuity by Unlocking Its Energy 
By John Boehner 
The notion that Washington can spend its way out of any problem does not pass what I call "the straight-face test." Rather than parceling taxpayer dollars out to fund a laundry list of government programs that will only paper over the problems facing our nation and the world, let the American people keep the $10 billion. They can use it far more wisely than Congress. Instead, let's unleash America's ingenuity to address the world's challenges and improve the quality of life for every American, as we have throughout our history. And to do that, let's begin by unlocking America's vast energy resources -- from our natural resources like coal, oil and gas to emerging technologies like alternative and renewable fuels. 
The fact is, the best, easiest way to boost American investment in alternative fuels and lower our nation's dependence on foreign oil won't cost taxpayers a cent. Democrats in Congress have placed millions of acres of U.S. territory -- far off our coasts, on the remote North Slope of Alaska, and in the Inter-Mountain West -- off limits for energy development. By freeing those domestic resources and increasing the supply of American energy, we can fund development of better solar, wind, biomass and other breakthrough technologies. And House Republicans have a plan to do it -- appropriately titled the American Energy Act, which reflects what we call an "all of the above" energy strategy. 
If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) would allow a vote on our comprehensive energy plan -- a vote House Republicans and hundreds of Americans demanded on the House floor this past Friday, after Congress adjourned, in a historic revolt -- we could create more American jobs, reduce America's energy dependence on nations with ties to global terrorism, cut emissions to promote a healthy environment, and raise our quality of life. And, we could do it without raising taxes -- and even without spending $10 billion. How? From the production of new American energy under our plan. 
For example, the Congressional Research Service estimates that at $100 per barrel (far below today's price), producing the estimated 10 billion barrels of oil in Alaska's remote Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would generate $153 billion in new federal revenues. Consider the sums we could generate if we produced new American energy in the Outer Continental Shelf far off our nation's shores, where an estimated 86 billion barrels are locked away, and in the Inter- Mountain West, where some 800 billion barrels of oil is trapped in shale deposits. The possibilities are seemingly endless. 
Nothing is impossible with affordable energy and the promise it holds for investments in technology and higher standards of living. Water can be lifted from deep below the earth. The desert can bloom. Crops can grow where they never did before. Electric lights burn at night so that studying, reading and commerce can outlast the sun. None of this would be possible without affordable and available energy. 
Reliable energy is among the most liberating forces in the world -- socially, economically and intellectually. In those parts of the world where energy is scarce or too expensive for citizens, daily life is consumed with the drudgery that the absence of energy causes. My goal -- and the goal of every parent -- is to leave our nation and our world in better shape than we inherited it. Key to making that happen is to finally solve the energy crisis America -- and the world -- currently faces. That begins with a vote and real action on an "all of the above" energy plan, not with a laundry list of new, costly Washington programs. 
Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, is the House minority leader. 
Helping Humanity Starts at Home 
By Harold Ford Jr. 
To be given $10 billion over four years to spend in a way that would best help humanity is a challenging proposition. The problems of the world -- from hunger and disease to terrorism to environmental degradation -- all are worthy projects for investment. But the best way for the United States to improve the condition of the world is to invest the $10 billion here at home in the long-term infrastructure needs of the country. 
Let me explain. Only an economically vibrant America can help solve some of the vexing problems around the globe. But the American economy is suffering a downturn. Until we turn it around and produce a long- term economic recovery, we will not be as effective in leading the world to solve the larger global challenges. 
The best way to begin restoring our economy is to spend the $10 billion over the next four years on strategic investments in building up our public infrastructure -- our airports, roads, bridges, ports, nuclear power plant security, broadband networks and environmental technologies. 
Public infrastructure investment not only creates well-paying jobs, but it also generates a healthy multiplier effect throughout the economy by creating demand for materials and services. New roads, for example, can increase the number of new homes, offices and other businesses. Ports link up towns to trade, and airports connect people to other economic centers within the global economy. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that spending $1 billion on building roads helps generate more than $6.2 billion in economic activity. Thus, if only the $10 billion were spent on roads, it would generate over $60 billion worth of economic benefit. 
The multiplier effect is just as powerful when it comes to investing in technology. American leadership in space led to investments in satellite communications, and the invention of the Internet led to Yahoo, Google, Amazon and thousands of other online businesses. Investing in the basic research of nanotechnology, life-sciences technology and new environmental technologies would create high-paying jobs in the worlds of engineering and sciences, and address potentially life-threatening challenges such as epidemics and global warming. 
Because the $10 billion is dwarfed by the infrastructure needs of the country, we will need to make sure that the money is spent in a way that will leverage the highest public return. To achieve maximum benefit for the investment that is made, we could create a National Infrastructure Bank (NIB) that would provide loans and loan guarantees for worthy projects. Funding the NIB with $10 billion in seed money would enable it to make loans and loan guarantees some five times its initial capitalization. Thus, it would be able to finance $50 billion in new projects, greatly expanding the amount of financing available for infrastructure investment. 
The NIB should also be allowed to pool, package and sell public infrastructure securities in the capital markets. With this authority, the NIB would be able to channel private finance into public infrastructure almost immediately. The ability to tap financing from pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds and other large institutional investors would allow the NIB to raise additional capital beyond the initial $10 billion and further maximize the public benefit. 
To ensure that the fund did not become a vehicle for random pork- barrel projects, it would be necessary to set up an advisory committee that would develop clear standards and priorities to be used when the NIB considered project requests. Exacting metrics would be applied to every infrastructure request to make sure that they provide the maximum amount of economic return for the investment made. 
A $10 billion investment in our nation's infrastructure, if spent wisely and leveraged aggressively, could help fund new environmental technologies to address global warming; new energy technologies to replace fossil fuels; new electrical technologies to charge electric cars; expanded and upgraded roads, bridges and airports; and new technologies like Internet II and the extension of online access to low-income and rural Americans. 
To lead in the 21st century, America will need to make strategic investments at home. To remain competitive in a global world and enhance our national security, it is an imperative. To work with our allies to create progress and prosperity in countries that have been left behind, there is no other way.

Most Oil in Santa Barbara Channel Is Natural Seepage

Abstract 
A recent study by University of California at Santa Barbara professors Bruce Luyendyk, Ira Leifer and J. R. Boles estimates that natural seepage amounts to 10,000 gallons of oil and 3.5 million cubic feet of natural gas a day (enough for 14,000 homes). 

Full Text 
Linda Krop's letter "Santa Barbara Deal Stops Drilling" (July 18) brags about stopping Santa Barbara Channel oil drilling and demonstrates the short-sightedness of the environmental movement. The largest problem within the channel is not drilling, but natural oil seepage. Oil and gas trapped in the Monterey Shale below the ocean floor seep up through fissures. It has been estimated that there are two billion barrels alone under an area known as the Coal Point Seeps. 
Natural oil seepage in the Santa Barbara Channel was first recorded by Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo on Oct. 16, 1542. He even used the tar from the seepage, known as asphaltum, to waterproof two of his ships, just as the native Chumash Indians did with their canoes. English explorer, George Vancouver, in his exploration of the Pacific Coast in 1792 while looking for the Northwest Passage, noted in his log book that the Santa Barbara Channel was covered in all directions with an oily surface so thick that the entire sea took on an iridescent hue. 
A recent study by University of California at Santa Barbara professors Bruce Luyendyk, Ira Leifer and J. R. Boles estimates that natural seepage amounts to 10,000 gallons of oil and 3.5 million cubic feet of natural gas a day (enough for 14,000 homes). That means about every three years there is the equivalent of a natural Exxon Valdez spill plus the natural emission of hundreds of millions of cubic feet of methane, a global warming gas much more powerful than CO2. The solution to stop this natural seepage is drilling and energy recovery to relieve the pressure under these underground fissures where the seepage occurs, which would have the additional benefit of reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
Since the 1969 oil spill accident in the Santa Barbara Channel, more than one billion barrels of oil have been recovered through drilling, while the total of spills amounts to just 853 barrels in the same 40- year period or about the equivalent of four days worth of Mother Nature's oil seepage within the channel.

Pelosi's Energy Stonewall

Hell -- otherwise known as Congress -- has officially frozen over. For the first time since the 1950s, Members will skip town today for the August recess without either chamber having passed a single appropriations bill. Then again, Democrats appear ready to sacrifice their whole agenda, even spending, rather than allow new domestic energy production. 
Or even a mere debate about energy. The Democratic leadership is stonewalling any measure that might possibly relax the Congressional ban on offshore drilling. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid know that they would lose if a vote ever came to the floor, and they're desperate to suppress an insurrection among those Democrats who are pragmatic about one of the top economic issues. Behind this whatever-it-takes obstructionism is an ideological commitment to high energy prices. The rulers of the Democratic Party want prices to keep rising. 
A good gauge of the radicalism of their energy blockade is the lowest common denominator of this energy fight: The effort to blame "speculators" for $4 gas was promoted by both Barack Obama and John McCain, as well as nearly everybody else in Washington. Sure enough, the House voted 276-151 on Wednesday for a bill that would have driven oil futures trading overseas. 
But the legislation actually failed to become law -- by design. It needed a two-thirds majority because Speaker Pelosi suspended the rules to prevent Republicans from offering amendments, drilling among them. Ms. Pelosi had decreed that she would not permit a roll-call vote under any circumstances, even if it stopped her own goal of wrecking the 
U.S. futures market. 
Meanwhile, the Senate is locked down over its own antispeculation bill. Majority Leader Reid briefly agreed to allow four amendments on GOP policy alternatives, but he withdrew the offer after he was subjected to the fury of the environmental lobby and Ms. Pelosi. To prevent a vote on offshore drilling this week, Senate Democrats also let fail a bill providing home heating assistance for the poor. Same thing for tax subsidies for wind and solar energy. 
Other liberal inspirations, including suing OPEC and a windfall profits tax on the oil industry, also ended up in the Congressional dumpster. And of course Democrats long ago shut down the normal budget process in both the Senate and the House to avoid any vote. 
Normally, the spending hiatus would be a useful byproduct of Congressional bickering. But in this case the shutdown is malign neglect. Surging energy prices act like a huge tax increase on the economy, since energy demand is relatively fixed over the short term. The price spike is imposing genuine hardships on middle-income and working-class voters across the country. 
The Democratic leadership isn't oblivious to this man-at-the-pump reality. But Al Gore's vision of the apocalyptic tides of climate change perfectly expresses their mentality: Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid see soaring prices as a public good -- the mechanism that will force energy enlightenment on the U.S. If anything, they think the price of gas is too low. As recently as June, the Senate debated a multitrillion-dollar carbon tax-and-regulation scheme that was designed to boost energy costs. A new version will be a priority in the next Administration. 
If nothing else, this summer's oil drilling stonewall is giving voters an insight into this ideology, which recoils at any oil, natural gas or coal production -- oh, and nuclear besides. That puts 93% of all U.S. energy off limits for expansion. Back in the real world, and barring a cold fusion or other miracle, the U.S. will remain dependent on fossil fuels for decades. A fresh round of domestic oil-and-gas exploration would ease the long-term pressures that supply and demand are exerting on prices, plus bolster energy security. 
And those not bound by anticarbon theology are coming around. Broad margins of the American public -- now even a slim majority of Californians -- favor increasing domestic production. Many Congressional Democrats are working below the radar to craft a compromise that couples drilling with conservation and programs to prop up renewable alternatives. 
But the leadership won't bend even a bit, and so Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid have spent the summer using every parliamentary deception to evade debating the issue that the American public cares most about. Short of cutting off the air conditioning on Capitol Hill, Democrats won't get the message until voters make them -- perhaps in November.

Abstract 
Mr. McClendon told a U.S. House committee that the country could attack rising gasoline prices and climate change by converting more coal plants to gas and using tax credits to spur sales of more natural-gas vehicles. 

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Chesapeake Energy Corp. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, trying to capitalize on potential U.S. gas discoveries, stepped up his campaign Wednesday to persuade Congress to encourage broader use of natural gas. 
Mr. McClendon told a U.S. House committee that the country could attack rising gasoline prices and climate change by converting more coal plants to gas and using tax credits to spur sales of more natural-gas vehicles. He said this could be done without raising prices for fertilizer, chemicals and other products that are made with natural gas. 
Asked whether natural-gas supplies were enough to reduce the nation's reliance on coal-fired plants to about 35% of electricity, from 50% currently, without raising natural-gas prices, Mr. McClendon said: "Three years ago I would have said, 'no.' Today I say, 'yes.'" 
Mr. McClendon was appearing before the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. 
Some regulators and companies that use natural gas are concerned that natural-gas prices will rise if the government adopts policies to increase its use. "We are concerned that adding new uses for natural gas, such as in transportation, will create new and relatively inelastic demand that we may not be able to meet without high prices," Rich Wells, a Dow Chemical Co. vice president, said in prepared testimony. 
Behind the gas industry's recent efforts to promote its product as a solution to high oil prices are recent discoveries in northern Louisiana and Texas, along with discoveries in an area that stretches from western New York to Virginia. 
A new report financed by The American Clean Skies Foundation -- a group started and now chaired by Mr. McClendon -- showed that the country has more natural gas than previously thought.

Abstract 
In Pittsylvania County, just north of the North Carolina border, the largest undeveloped uranium deposit in the United States -- and the seventh largest in the world, according to industry monitor UX Consulting -- sits on land owned by neighbors Henry Bowen and Walter Coles. 

Full Text 
Chatham, Va. -- Amid the rolling hills and verdant pastures of south central Virginia an unlikely new front in the battle over nuclear energy is opening up. How it is decided will tell us a lot about whether this country is willing to get serious about addressing its energy needs. 
In Pittsylvania County, just north of the North Carolina border, the largest undeveloped uranium deposit in the United States -- and the seventh largest in the world, according to industry monitor UX Consulting -- sits on land owned by neighbors Henry Bowen and Walter Coles. Large uranium deposits close to the surface are virtually unknown in the 
U.S. east of the Mississippi River. And that may be the problem. 
Virginia is one of just four states that ban uranium mining. The ban was put in place in 1984, to calm fears that had been sparked by the partial meltdown of a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island outside of Harrisburg, Pa. in 1979. 
Messrs. Bowen and Coles, who last year formed a company called Virginia Uranium, are asking the state to determine whether mining uranium really is a hazard and, if not, to lift the ban. But they've run into a brick wall of environmental activists who raise the specter of nuclear contamination and who are determined to prevent scientific studies of the issue. 
The Piedmont Environmental Council is one of the leading opponents. It warns of the "enormous quantities of radioactive waste" produced by uranium mining. 
Jack Dunavant, head of the Southside Concerned Citizens in nearby Halifax County, is another outspoken critic. He paints a picture of environmental apocalypse. "There will be a dead zone within a 30 mile radius of the mine," he says with a courtly drawl. "Nothing will grow. Animals will die. The radiation genetically alters tissue. Animals will not be able to reproduce. We'll see malformed fetuses." 
Yet it is not as if we have no experience with uranium mining, which is in fact relatively harmless. Handled properly, the yellowcake that is extracted is no more hazardous than regular household chemicals (and unlike coal, it won't smolder and combust). 
James Kelly, who directed the nuclear engineering program at the University of Virginia for many years, says that fears about uranium mining are wildly overblown. "It's an aesthetic nightmare, but otherwise safe in terms of releasing any significant radioactivity or pollution," he told me. "It would be ugly to look at, but from the perspective of any hazard I wouldn't mind if they mined across the street from me." 
The situation is rich with irony as well as uranium. While you can't mine yellowcake, it is perfectly legal in Virginia to process enriched uranium into usable nuclear fuel, which is somewhat dangerous to handle. A subsidiary of the French nuclear giant Areva operates a fuel fabrication facility in Lynchburg 50 miles from Chatham. It has been praised by Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, as a good corporate citizen. The state is also home to four commercial nuclear reactors, which provide Virginians with 35% of their electricity. And, of course, the U.S. Navy operates nuclear ships out of Norfolk, Va. 
Across the country, there are 104 commercial nuclear reactors. They consume 67 million pounds of uranium annually, the vast majority of which is imported from Australia, Canada and former Soviet republics. The 200-acre Coles Hill deposit (Mr. Coles's family has lived on the spot since 1785) is thought to contain nearly twice that amount. For Messrs. Bowen and Coles, with the long-term price of uranium near $80 per pound, that means they are sitting on about $10 billion worth of ore. But for the rest of us, it means they are sitting on an opportunity to make the U.S. more energy self-sufficient. 
Since Virginia is already a nuclear-friendly state that properly manages the risks of nuclear power, what sense does it make for the state to ban the safest step in the nuclear fuel cycle? 
Gov. Kaine supports allowing the National Academy of Sciences to determine whether mining could be done safely. So does virtually every elected official in heavily Republican Pittsylvania County. Earlier this year the narrowly Democratic state Senate voted 34-6 to authorize the study. But the measure was killed in committee in the House under pressure from environmental groups. If it was allowed to come up for a vote in the full House, which is controlled by Republicans, opponents concede it would have passed. 
The governor's chief energy adviser, Steve Walz, says the Kaine administration has taken no position on whether reversing the ban makes sense. "That's why we wanted to see the results of the study, to help us make a determination." 
Mr. Dunavant doesn't believe the governor has an open mind on the issue. He calls Mr. Kaine, "our 'supposed green' governor" and says that the "only thing green about him is his love of money." Coles Hill "is all about greed," he says. "It's criminal activity as far as I'm concerned." 
For his part, Mr. Coles can't understand the hostility. "I tell these groups that my concerns are your concerns. I have been protecting the environment here for decades, long before any of them became interested in this land." He's received offers to buy his land for sums that would make him incredibly wealthy, but has turned them down. "We love the land. My family has lived here for over 200 years. We're going to continue to live here. That's the reason we decided to keep it, as opposed to selling out." He says Virginia Uranium will continue to push for the independent study. 
If the U.S. is to expand nuclear power's role in a time of energy insecurity and climate change worries, we will have to confront the hysterical antinuclear pronouncements that have been the currency of environmentalists for nearly 30 years. The Old Dominion could be a good place for a new start.

Democrats and Energy: Reality Bites

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
Former Vice President Al Gore recently took his climate-change show on the road for the benefit of liberal bloggers, Sunday morning TV aficionados and other innocent bystanders. This week he laid out his demand for a miraculous transformation in U.S. energy use over a mere 10 years. As for drilling for more oil? "Absurd," the Nobel Laureate scoffed. "When you're in a hole, stop digging." 
The same might be said for Mr. Gore. For while his message hasn't changed, the political realities of the energy debate have. Suddenly, Mr. Gore's inconvenient speechifying only tightens the vice Democrats find themselves in over drilling. 
Voters' pocketbooks are now involved, making them more skeptical about climate change -- and about the utility of any policies aimed at influencing climate change. The environmental movement is facing a critical moment. Democrats who support the greenies in their most ambitious goals, and scariest pseudo-scientific rhetoric, suddenly seem woefully out of touch with American voters. 
Back in June, Barack Obama made hay of John McCain's comment that while opening lands to drilling might not have a short term direct impact on oil supply and prices, it would have a "psychological impact" by sending a signal to consumers and the market that the country was expanding its own resources. "In case you're wondering," Mr. Obama said, "that's Washington-speak for 'it polls well.'" 
Ho, ho. But oil prices have fallen since President Bush announced his support for more drilling. And polls these days are shifting overwhelmingly in favor of it. More than two-thirds of Americans support expanding drilling along the coasts, and 59% approve of drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge, according to a Reuters-Zogby poll. The worst news for Democrats is that support for drilling is now a majority opinion even in their own constituency. 
The quandary for Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi et al. is how to keep irate environmentalists inside the tent while still meeting voter demand for lower prices. Raging against oil companies and Wall Street may get you through a news cycle or two, but it's not a solution. 
As recently as April, the environmental agenda was a progressive's happy-clappy laundry list: A windfall profits tax, plans to sue OPEC, and even some price-gouging investigations of the oil-industrial complex. June saw Senate Democrats' embarassing failure to move a cap- and-trade bill. Now they aren't doing much besides fighting for a crackdown on oil speculators. No doubt they will claim that this week's share climbdown in oil prices is the result. But, by their nature, market speculators frequently shift their bets and estimates. That's what's happening now, as almost everybody agrees that whatever the long-term challenges, oil supply is adequate to meet demand at prices equivalent of $4 gallon for gas in the U.S. 
Equally empty is Democrats' bright idea for "use it or lose it" legislation, which would presumably punish oil companies so dumb as to be sitting on usable leases at a time of $140 oil. Are they waiting for lower prices? House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer must have drawn the short lot, since he had to go out and shill for the Democratic story to the press: "Democrats are saying let's drill. Let's explore. Let's get energy for Americans from America and have it for Americans." 
Such measures are Democrats' first line of defense on drilling, which is to pray for some blind luck. Maybe oil prices will go down on their own and Democrats will no longer have to choose between making the greenies or motorists happy. 
Even Mr. Gore, though he pretends no longer to be a politician, falls prey to such triangulation: Consider his unwillingness, no matter how dire his view of the climate situation, to endorse nuclear power as the quickest, cleanest replacement for the coal-fired plants that are a big part of the alleged CO2 problem. 
Mr. Obama has been opposed to nuclear power too, but shows more inclination to throw PC positions over the side for the general election. France and Russia have made nuclear power a central part of their energy strategies. Mr. Obama, if he's elected, will inherit a federal establishment that has been moving unsteadily toward licensing the first new nukes in a generation. 
None of this is to disparage the long-term prospects of renewables, solar, etc. Such a shift won't come on Mr. Gore's timetable, however, but only when consumers discover new technologies can actually heat their homes and get them to work in the morning at less cost and comparable speed to today's petroleum-based transportation economy. 
Early-stage prototypes are neat for science shows. They don't inspire confidence in leaders who put all their stock in them before anyone can say how much it will cost in time and money to hook up your car's battery at the station on the way to work. 
In the meantime, ensuring adequate supplies of oil and gas and coal are tantamount to electoral survival. Democrats, after a long holiday from reality occasioned by cheap oil, are beginning to understand that either they have to take up the challenge of meeting America's need for oil, or voters will find someone who will.

Abstract 
ONSAN, South Korea -- A French chemical maker is reaping a potential billion-dollar windfall under a United Nations program intended to spur climate-friendly investment in the developing world, highlighting the challenges of using market forces to tackle global warming. The money is meant to flow to poorer countries to develop clean-air technology -­for instance, an African nation would get a financial incentive to build windmills instead of a cheaper, but dirtier, coal-fired power plant.

ONSAN, South Korea -- A French chemical maker is reaping a potential billion-dollar windfall under a United Nations program intended to spur climate-friendly investment in the developing world, highlighting the challenges of using market forces to tackle global warming. 
The company, Rhodia SA, manufactures hundreds of tons a day of adipic acid, an ingredient in nylon, at its factory here. But the real money is in what it doesn't make. 
The payday, which could amount to more than $1 billion over seven years, comes from destroying nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, an unwanted byproduct and potent greenhouse gas. It's Rhodia's single most profitable business world-wide. Last year, destroying nitrous oxide here and at a similar plant in Brazil generated 189 million euros ($300.5 million) in sales of pollution "credits." 
The laughing gas is big money thanks to the U.N.-administered program in which polluters in rich countries buy credits like Rhodia's, effectively paying for the privilege of continuing to emit greenhouse gases. The money is meant to flow to poorer countries to develop clean-air technology -- for instance, an African nation would get a financial incentive to build windmills instead of a cheaper, but dirtier, coal-fired power plant. 
Rhodia's experience shows that even a major Western industrial company can cash in on the pollution-trading program. The Rhodia factory in Onsan alone is slated to bring in more money, under the U.N.-administered program, than all the clean-air projects currently registered on the continent of Africa. 
The U.N. system is designed to use market mechanisms -- the trade in credits -- to curb emissions in the developing world without stunting those countries' economies. Critics say the system is flawed. The money from selling credits reduces the incentive for a relatively wealthy country like South Korea to adopt voluntary cuts of its own, they argue. 
"Markets are incredibly powerful institutions," says David Victor, a Stanford University professor who studies climate policy. But in some cases, he says, "you cannot create the right kind of market forces." 
Some also question the logic of paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Rhodia for installing pollution-control equipment that cost a bare fraction of that, about $15 million or so, to install. Simply paying for the installation of the equipment "could have done this an awful lot more cheaply," says Patrick McCully of International Rivers, an environmental group. 
Rhodia points out its Onsan project was approved by both local authorities in South Korea and administrators of the U.N. program. Its projects prevent tens of thousands of tons of nitrous oxide -- which is 310 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide -- from floating into the atmosphere, the company says. 
Philippe Rosier, president of Rhodia's Energy Services division, says the company is committed to environmental protection and has pledged to cut its own greenhouse-gas emissions in France voluntarily by 30% from their 1990 levels by 2010. The company says its efforts world-wide cut the equivalent of 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year; for more than half of those reductions, it says, it receives no compensation. 
The U.N. defends its pollution-trading system, saying it helps industrialized countries meet their obligations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in a cost-effective way. Regarding windfalls for companies like Rhodia, Conor Barry, an official at the U.N.'s climate secretariat in Bonn, Germany, says the U.N.'s objective is mainly to determine that any emissions reductions are "additional" -- that is, they wouldn't have happened without the financial incentives provided by the U.N.'s pollution-trading program. 
Mr. Barry declined to speak specifically about Rhodia. In granting approval to this or any project, the U.N. is in effect concluding it will be "additional." 
Rhodia can claim credits for pollution-cutting at the Onsan plant thanks to international climate negotiations, conducted in the 1990s, that categorize South Korea as a "developing" nation. Under the global agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol, developing nations don't have to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions, but they get a nice bonus if they do: Each ton of emissions cut generates a credit that can be sold through the U.N. program. Rich countries (most of which are required to cut emissions under the Kyoto treaty) can buy the credits in lieu of cleaning up what comes out of their own smokestacks. Individual European companies can also buy credits to meet their caps under European Union rules. 
The U.S. hasn't signed on to Kyoto. But U.S. lawmakers are debating implementing a similar pollution-trading system. 
Today, South Korea's designation as a developing nation looks outmoded. The country is an industrial powerhouse and home to global brands like Samsung and Hyundai. Per capita gross domestic product is roughly $20,000, putting it on par with Portugal, which is considered a "developed" economy under Kyoto. 
South Korea's economic muscle, combined with developing-nation status, means it has plenty of pollution to profitably cut. That has transformed South Korea into a hotbed of pollution-credit sales. So far, South Korea has received about 18% of all the credits issued world-wide. 
Koreans say the rules are the rules, and the world agreed to them. "I can't say the critics are groundless," says Jung Jaesoo, 48 years old, who runs a consulting firm that advises Korean companies on how to qualify for credits. "But the Kyoto Protocol is a multilateral agreement. It is impossible to make only South Korea an exception now." 
Mr. Jung's company, Ecoeye Co., has shepherded about a dozen projects to U.N. approval, among them wind, tidal, solar and hydroelectric power plants. 
In credits received so far, South Korea is behind only China and India, two much poorer countries that have per capita GDPs of about $2,500 and $1,000, respectively. 
"I think South Korea has great potential," Mr. Jung says. There are still a number of industries, including semiconductors and flat-panel displays, that can sell credits, Mr. Jung says. "These industries produce a lot of greenhouse gases." 
South Korea's experience is spurring pollution-credit prospectors like Mr. Jung to scour other countries in Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, for easy pollution reductions. 
Michael Hennig, who works in South Korea for a German trading firm and helped set up a deal to sell credits from a fertilizer factory, says he, too, has been peppered with inquiries. "It's a good business, because the Western world is basically desperate" to purchase these credits, says Mr. Hennig. "If I would have more [credits], I think I could sell them all." 
The U.N.'s pollution-trading system doesn't directly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere, since each ton of carbon dioxide cut in a developing country allows someone in an industrialized country to pollute that same amount. Rather, the idea is to transfer money to poor countries to encourage construction of environmentally sensitive factories and spur alternative-energy use. Otherwise, the argument goes, global greenhouse-gas emissions would grow more quickly as developing nations like China expand their economies. 
One factor that's spurred the rush into South Korea is a looming deadline: Many expect the country will be reclassified a "developed" country after 2012, when Kyoto's current requirements end. That means extra urgency for companies to get credits now. Park Chun-kyoo, director of the South Korean environment ministry's climate-change policy division, says it is "much too early" to say what will happen at international climate talks. 
Critics say the system that funnels money to companies in places like South Korea is partly to blame. It sends signals that "are exactly the opposite of what we should be sending," says Mr. Victor, the Stanford professor. For South Korea -- a relatively wealthy nation -- emissions cuts should be an obligation, not a windfall, he says. "It's just part of being a responsible citizen." 
Western nations are likely to press for South Korea to be recategorized as developed. At this month's meeting of the Group of 8 nations, officials from the U.S. pressed for Asian countries to promise to cut their own emissions as a part of a new climate accord to take effect after Kyoto. 
Until then, the current pollution-credit program is likely to balloon. At the summit, G-8 nations committed to major emissions reductions, and the EU passed a measure bringing airlines into Europe's pollution-trading system in 2012. Both moves will spur demand for more pollution credits. 
No one has mined South Korea for credits as successfully as Rhodia. The Paris-based company was spun off in 1998 from Rhone-Poulenc, a French chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. 
The subsequent years were unkind. Rhodia creaked under heavy debt. The ballyhooed recall early this decade of the painkiller Vioxx, after reports of heart problems, crippled Rhodia's contract-drug- manufacturing business. 
But by 2003, Rhodia managers had figured out that two of its factories -- the Onsan plant in South Korea and the Brazil facility -- were jackpots. For reducing one ton of carbon dioxide, the U.N. issues one credit. One ton of the more potent nitrous oxide yields 310 credits. 
These credits are currently changing hands at about 21 euros on European markets, although prices can vary wildly because the market is relatively new. 
Many adipic-acid plants long ago slashed nitrous oxide emissions. Indeed, the technology to burn it off was developed in the 1970s. By the 1990s, most adipic-acid producers in the U.S. and Europe started to voluntarily cut their emissions under pressure from environmentalists. Rhodia itself did so in 1998 at its plant in Chalampe, France. 
But it had left its then-smaller Brazil and Onsan plants unmodified. At the time, "there was no obligation to do it," says Mr. Rosier of Rhodia, the executive in charge of the credit project. 
The advent of credit sales under the U.N. program in 2004 made nitrous-oxide abatement lucrative. In 2006, Rhodia turned on the furnace to destroy the gas at the Onsan plant. The furnace cost roughly $15 million to install. It was a good investment: The plant is projected to generate more than nine million credits a year, and Rhodia is initially authorized for seven years of credits. 
The Onsan factory sits in an industrial park that runs for four miles up the Korean coast, wedged between evergreen hillocks and the open sea. The plant is a gurgling network of boilers and centrifuges. A metal pipe carries the waste gas outside, where it is stripped of other pollutants, fed with natural gas and then burned off. An outside auditor checks emissions data, and every few weeks the U.N. issues new credits. 
In the case of some greenhouse gases, the U.N. imposes constraints to combat the "perverse incentives" to run a factory simply to generate pollution credits, says the U.N.'s Mr. Barry. A few years ago, the U.N. came under fire after some Chinese plants started reaping huge numbers of credits for relatively small changes to their manufacturing process. 
There are no such U.N. constraints on adipic-acid production, Mr. Barry says, since there's demand for the finished product, given its importance in manufacturing nylon. "With adipic-acid prices, it's not considered economically viable to produce the product" simply to generate pollution credits for sale, he says. However, he adds, the U.N.'s panel examines the situation regularly as prices change. 
Currently, if adipic-acid production is a profitable business, it's only barely. The average cost of producing adipic acid was just over $1,750 a metric ton in June, while the sales prices in the benchmark Chinese market were barely higher, at around $1,800 a metric ton, according to industry consultant PCI Nylon GmbH. That works out to a slim profit of roughly $50 a metric ton. "The economics of adipic-acid production are currently pretty awful," says PCI's Robin MacDonald. 
The figures suggest that Rhodia almost certainly makes more money from selling pollution credits than it does from producing adipic acid. If Rhodia's adipic acid at Onsan generates a profit of $50 or so a metric ton, that's worth $7.5 million a year. The company is making much larger sums from sales of pollution credits: According to U.N. figures, Rhodia was issued more than 11 million credits for cuts in 2007; at the 15 euros price Rhodia says it recently has been getting, they are worth some 173 million euros ($275.1 million). 
Mr. Rosier declined to comment on the relative profitability of adipic acid and pollution credits. He played down the financial significance of credit sales, saying the price of credits is highly volatile and could fall. 
As to whether it is sensible for his company to reap rewards for installing pollution-control technology in a highly industrial country like South Korea, Mr. Rosier says the rules of the U.N.'s system were set by the Kyoto negotiators. 
"We were not part of these discussions, we didn't make the rules of the game," he says. "We know only to work with the rules as they were set down."

Abstract 
American Electric Power Co., Austin Energy, Consolidated Edison Inc., Dominion Resources Inc., Duke Energy Corp., DTE Energy Co., Edison International, New York Power Authority, PG&E Corp., Progress Energy Inc. and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., to name a few. 

Full Text 
Three dozen electric utilities and General Motors Corp. agreed to collaborate on smoothing a path for a plug-in electric vehicle that is slated to roll out in about two years. 
The collaboration is the first major effort by the two industries on an electric vehicle and includes some of the biggest names in the power sector, so far spanning utilities that operate in nearly 40 states: American Electric Power Co., Austin Energy, Consolidated Edison Inc., Dominion Resources Inc., Duke Energy Corp., DTE Energy Co., Edison International, New York Power Authority, PG&E Corp., Progress Energy Inc. and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., to name a few. 
Both industries have a lot riding on the success of plug-in cars that will run largely on electricity, with gasoline or other fuels filling a supplementary role. Auto makers need a hot-selling product to revive sales and hope the technology will slash gasoline consumption and reduce reliance on imported oil. GM plans to introduce the Chevrolet Volt and Saturn Vue as its first models. Other auto makers, including Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co., are working on versions of plug-in cars. 
After more than a century of relying on gasoline as the main fuel for automobiles, GM and its rivals are scrambling to diversify energy sources. The Chevy Volt, due in late 2010, is intended to be the boldest effort yet, designed to run at full speed for at least 40 miles solely on lithium-ion batteries. Unless plugged in for a recharge, the gasoline engine kicks in at that point. 
Auto makers need the cooperation of utilities since they control the new technology's primary fuel -- electricity -- and must make sure that the vehicles' recharging processes mesh with the electricity grid and don't inadvertently undermine grid reliability. GM first started courting utilities and other energy-related companies last year, knowing it needs the cooperation of several players, including battery makers, to produce plug-in vehicles that function as well as conventional cars and trucks. 
"GM is introducing production cars that have to work in all 50 states and Canada," said Mark Duvall, program manager for electric transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., an industry research group that is participating in the collaboration. "But every electric system is a little bit different, so there are a lot of little issues to work out." 
At the most basic level, intelligence that will be embedded in the cars in the form of computer chips and software needs to be met with equal intelligence on the utility side. That way, a car that plugs into a garage electric outlet will be recognized as a car by the utility and recharged when it is best for the electric system and, perhaps, at a price that will be lower for cars than other appliances. 
What utilities don't want is for cars to recharge during hot summer afternoons, when they could push wholesale electricity prices into a more expensive tier. Off-peak recharging actually could make the electric system more efficient by slightly increasing production at power plants with capacity to spare. Research shows there is enough excess electrical capacity at night to recharge tens of millions of vehicles. 
Intelligence in the systems is important for another reason. Congress is considering climate-change legislation that would set a price on carbon-dioxide emissions. Utilities might get special consideration if they can prove their electricity is replacing gasoline and cutting overall emissions. 
GM would like to take special rates and incentives and use them to build sales. According to current projections, it should be much cheaper to recharge a car overnight than to buy the equivalent amount of gasoline. Cars recharged daily could go 600 miles or more between fill-ups. 
As utilities begin to confront the integration issues, they also are considering how much they want to encourage deployment. Austin Energy, a city-owned utility that serves the Texas capital, has decided to offer a $1,000 incentive to people who buy plug-in cars. 
Electric-industry research shows electrifying transportation cuts emissions even if electricity is made by burning coal. That is because power plants burn coal more efficiently than the internal-combustion engine consumes gasoline.

Abstract 
Mr. Gore's argument would be helped if he were also willing to propose huge investments in nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide and currently supplies about one-fifth of U.S. electricity needs, and about three-quarters of France's. In his useful book "Gusher of Lies," Robert Bryce notes that "in July 2006, wind turbines in California produced power at only about 10% of their capacity; in Texas, one of the most promising states for wind energy, the windmills produced electricity at about 17% of their rated capacity." 

Full Text 
Al Gore gave a speech last week "challenging" America to run "on 100% zero-carbon electricity in 10 years" -- though that's just the first step on his road to "ending our reliance on carbon-based fuels." Serious people understand this is absurd. Maybe other people will start drawing the same conclusion about the man proposing it. 
The former vice president has also recently disavowed any intention of returning to politics. This is wise. As America's leading peddler of both doom and salvation, Mr. Gore has moved beyond the constraints and obligations of reality. His job is to serve as a Prophet of Truth. 
In Mr. Gore's prophesy, a transition to carbon-free electricity generation in a decade is "achievable, affordable and transformative." He believes that the goal can be achieved almost entirely through the use of "renewables" alone, meaning solar, geothermal, wind power and biofuels. 
And he doesn't think we really have any other good options: "The survival of the United States of America as we know it is at risk," he says, with his usual gift for understatement. "And even more -- if more should be required -- the future of human civilization is at stake." 
What manner the catastrophe might take isn't yet clear, but the scenarios are grim: The climate crisis is getting worse faster than anticipated; global warming will cause refugee crises and destabilize entire nations; an "energy tsunami" is headed our way. And so on. 
Here, however, is an inconvenient fact. In 1995, the U.S. got about 2.2% of its net electricity generation from "renewable" sources, according to the Energy Information Administration. By 2000, the last full year of the Clinton administration, that percentage had dropped to 2.1%. By contrast, the combined share of coal, petroleum and natural gas rose to 70% from 68% during the same time frame. 
Now the share of renewables is up slightly, to about 2.3% as of 2006 (the latest year for which the EIA provides figures). The EIA thinks the use of renewables (minus hydropower) could rise to 201 billion kilowatt hours per year in 2018 from the current 65 billion. But the EIA also projects total net generation in 2018 to be 4.4 trillion kilowatt hours per year. That would put the total share of renewables at just over four percent of our electricity needs. 
Mr. Gore's argument would be helped if he were also willing to propose huge investments in nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide and currently supplies about one-fifth of U.S. electricity needs, and about three-quarters of France's. Britain has just approved eight new nuclear plants, and the German government of Angela Merkel is working to do away with a plan by the previous government to go nuclear-free. 
But Mr. Gore makes no mention of nuclear power in his speech, nor of the equally carbon-free hydroelectric power. These are proven technologies -- and useful reminders of what happens when environmentalists get what they wished for. 
Mr. Gore's case would also be helped if our experience of renewable sources were a positive one. It isn't. In his useful book "Gusher of Lies," Robert Bryce notes that "in July 2006, wind turbines in California produced power at only about 10% of their capacity; in Texas, one of the most promising states for wind energy, the windmills produced electricity at about 17% of their rated capacity." Like wind power, solar power also suffers from the problem of intermittency, which means that it has to be backed up by conventional sources in order to avoid disruptions. This is especially true of hot summers when the wind doesn't blow and cold winters when the sun doesn't shine. 
And then there are biofuels, whose recent vogue, the World Bank believes, may have been responsible for up to 75% of the recent rise in world food prices. Save the planet; starve the poor. 
None of this seems to trouble Mr. Gore. He thinks that simply by declaring an emergency he can help achieve Stakhanovite results. He might recall what the Stakhanovite myth (about the man who mined 14 times his quota of coal in six hours) actually did to the Soviet economy. 
A more interesting question is why Mr. Gore remains believable. Perhaps people think that facts ought not to count against a man whose task is to raise our sights, or play Cassandra to unbelieving mortals. 
Or maybe he is believed simply because people want something in which to believe. "The readiness for self-sacrifice," wrote Eric Hoffer in "The True Believer," "is contingent on an imperviousness to the realities of life. . . . All active mass movements strive, therefore, to interpose a fact-proof screen between the faithful and the realities of the world. They do this by claiming that the ultimate and absolute truth is already embodied in their doctrine and that there is no truth nor certitude outside it . . . To rely on the evidence of the senses and of reason is heresy and treason. It is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make belief possible."

Let's Have Some Love for Nuclear Power

Abstract 
If we are now going to choose nuclear power as a way to resolve both our concerns about global warming and our looming energy shortfalls, we are first going to have to engage in a national debate about whether or not we accept the technology. Bring the source of this heat -- the uranium -- to the surface, put it in a carefully controlled environment, and accelerate its breakdown a bit to raise temperatures to around 700 degrees Fahrenheit, and use it to boil water. 

Full Text 
All over the world, nuclear power is making a comeback. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has just commissioned eight new reactors, and says there's "no upper limit" to the number Britain will build in the future. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has challenged her country's program to phase out 17 nuclear reactors by 2020, saying it will be impossible to deal with climate change without them. China and India are building nuclear power plants; France and Russia, both of whom have embraced the technology, are fiercely competing to sell them the hardware. 
And just last month John McCain called for the construction of 45 new reactors by 2030. Barack Obama is less enthusiastic about nuclear energy, but he seems to be moving toward tacit approval. 
In the U.S. at present, 104 nuclear plants generate about 21% of our electric power. Last November, NRG Energy, of Princeton, N.J., became the first company to file for a license to build a new nuclear plant since the 1970s. Almost a dozen more applications have now also been filed. 
While we may be at a turning point, one enormous question still hangs over this revival of nuclear power in the U.S.: Who is going to pay for it? The construction of reactors in the rest of the world is essentially a government enterprise. Private investment and even public approval are not always necessary. In the U.S., however, the capital will have to be raised from Wall Street. But not many investors are willing to put up $5 billion to $10 billion for a project that could become engulfed by 10 to 15 years of regulatory delay -­as occurred during the 1980s. The Seabrook plant in New Hampshire went through 14 years of that before opening in 1990. The Long Island Lighting Company's Shoreham plant began in 1973, but was shut down by protests in 1989 without generating a watt of electricity, and the company went bankrupt as a result. 
If we are now going to choose nuclear power as a way to resolve both our concerns about global warming and our looming energy shortfalls, we are first going to have to engage in a national debate about whether or not we accept the technology. To begin this discussion, I suggest redefining what we call nuclear power as "terrestrial energy." 
Every fuel used in human history -- firewood, coal, oil, wind and water -- has been derived from the sun. But terrestrial energy is different. 
Terrestrial energy is the heat at the earth's core that raises its temperature to 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the surface of the sun. Remarkably, this heat derives largely from a single source -- the radioactive breakdown of uranium and thorium. The energy released in the breakdown of these two elements is enough to melt iron, stoke volcanoes and float the earth's continents like giant barges on its molten core. 
Geothermal plants are a way of tapping this heat. They are generally located near fumaroles and geysers, where groundwater meets hot spots in the earth's crust. If we dig down far enough, however, we will encounter more than enough heat to boil water. Engineers are now talking about drilling down 10 miles (the deepest oil wells are only five miles) to tap this energy. 
Here's a better idea: Bring the source of this heat -- the uranium -- to the surface, put it in a carefully controlled environment, and accelerate its breakdown a bit to raise temperatures to around 700 degrees Fahrenheit, and use it to boil water. That's what we do in a nuclear reactor. 
Because the public first became aware of nuclear energy through warfare, reactors have always been thought of as "silent bombs." But nuclear plants cannot explode. The fissionable isotope of uranium must be enriched to 90% to create a weapon. In a reactor it is only 3%. You could not blow up a nuclear reactor if you tried. 
Nor is the threat of terrorists crashing an airplane into a reactor and setting off a holocaust very plausible. The Department of Energy once crashed an F-4 jet going 500 miles per hour into a concrete wall the thickness of a nuclear containment structure. The plane vaporized while the concrete was barely dented. (You can watch it on YouTube: "Plane crashes into wall.") 
Finally, the problem of radioactive waste has been absurdly exaggerated. More than 95% of the material in a spent fuel rod can be recycled for energy and medical isotopes. 
We have a nuclear waste problem in this country because we gave up reprocessing in the 1970s. The fear was that terrorists or foreign nationals would steal plutonium from American reactors to build bombs. This is a bit like worrying that terrorists will steal all the gold from Fort Knox. Other countries have built bombs in the intervening years. They didn't need American plutonium to do it. 
Meanwhile, France has proved that reprocessing works. With a fully developed nuclear cycle, the French now store all the waste from 30 years of producing 75% of its electricity beneath the floor of one room at La Hague in Normandy. 
Three days after Sen. McCain made his proposal on June 18, Admiral "Skip" Bowman, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, wrote an op- ed asking for yet more government support in developing nuclear energy. It can't work this way. 
If nuclear energy is to progress, it must stand on its own. That means Wall Street has to invest. And convincing Wall Street to invest means persuading the public that there is nothing unacceptably dangerous or diabolical about nuclear power. 
Mr. Tucker's book, "Terrestrial Energy: How Nuclear Power Can Lead the Green Revolution and End America's Long Energy Odyssey," will be published in September by Bartleby.

Administration Releases EPA Report, Then Repudiates It; Blueprint to Reduce Greenhouse Gases Called Too Costly

Abstract 
The Bush administration has long opposed economy-wide regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions, and argued that allowing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions would turn it into a massive planning and zoning board, with the power to block construction of schools, hospitals, apartment buildings and a range of other facilities whose emissions have previously not been subject to regulation. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration published a government blueprint to reduce the U.S. output of global-warming gases, but at the same time rejected the document out of hand -- saying it relied on "untested legal theories" and would impose "crippling costs" on the U.S. economy. 
Essentially, the White House presented critics of the report with a prepackaged rebuttal brief, in what is expected to be the Bush administration's last major effort to frame the national discussion on responding to global warming before a new president inherits the issue. The White House argues the Environmental Protection Agency must not be allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, for fear it would be able to block development across the country. 
The EPA document was written to respond to a Supreme Court order: The court instructed the agency to decide whether greenhouse gases are a danger to public health or welfare. Instead, the final document took no position on the court's question -- yet escalated the extraordinary battle between the agency and the White House. 
The White House rejected an earlier draft that did find a danger to welfare, which would trigger application of the strict rules of the Clean Air Act to regulating greenhouse gases. This time, the agency stopped short of the endangerment finding, but still drew up a road map for using the Clean Air Act. That led the White House to warn of a government "command-and-control" regime that would regulate virtually every aspect of American life from cars to factories, hotels and lawnmowers. 
The EPA's document represents the denouement of a long-simmering conflict between the EPA's career staff and the White House, which has caught EPA administrator Stephen Johnson in an awkward middle ground. On Friday, he praised his staff's "great work" in trying to put "a square peg into a round hole," but rejected its findings, siding with other cabinet members in dismissing use of the Clean Air Act. 
The EPA's report attempts to summarize the benefits and costs of regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, and makes no recommendations. But its details may be less significant than its potential political impact. 
By highlighting the costs of greenhouse-gas regulation at a time when many American consumers and businesses are reeling from high energy prices, the Bush Administration is trying to push back against calls by congressional Democrats for it to use its existing authority to place limits on such emissions. 
Both of Mr. Bush's would-be successors -- Arizona Republican John McCain and Illinois Democrat Barack Obama -- have expressed support for capping greenhouse-gas emissions. The Bush administration's actions Friday highlight the concerns about the costs of such regulation. Those concerns -- pushed intensely by Republicans and some business lobbyists -- helped to derail legislation in the Senate last month that was aimed at responding to climate change. 
In a letter accompanying the EPA document, Susan Dudley, administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, bluntly disavowed the EPA's analysis, saying it relied on "untested legal theories" and "cannot be considered Administration policy or representative of the views of the Administration." In the letter, dated Thursday and addressed to Mr. Johnson, she added, "There is strong disagreement with many of the legal, analytical, economic, science and policy interpretations in the draft." 
The administration also attached a letter from the secretaries of transportation, agriculture, commerce and energy, asserting that the EPA's work "does not recognize the enormous -- and, we believe, insurmountable -- burdens, difficulties and costs, and likely limited benefits" of using the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases. 
A spokesman for Sen. Obama said he was "disappointed in the White House's decision to again refuse to tackle greenhouse gas emissions." A spokesman for Sen. McCain said the approach outlined by the EPA "would give a small, unelected group of bureaucrats unprecedented power to regulate broad swaths of our economy -- effectively placing production, employment and investment decisions under government control." 
The Bush administration has long opposed economy-wide regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions, and argued that allowing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions would turn it into a massive planning and zoning board, with the power to block construction of schools, hospitals, apartment buildings and a range of other facilities whose emissions have previously not been subject to regulation. 
The final document affirms the agency's authority to tackle climate change, and suggests a variety of regulatory avenues. It concludes automobiles could be more fuel-efficient than currently required by law. Based on advanced technologies such as plug-in hybrid vehicles, fuel efficiency could be improved to more than 35 miles per gallon between 2020 and 2025, the document said. A 2007 energy law supported by the Bush administration mandates an average vehicle fuel-efficiency of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. 
For other sectors, the document describes how emissions such as carbon dioxide could be regulated through government permits and an emissions trading system similar to one the EPA administers for acid rain pollution. The analysis has been sharply disputed by President Bush's aides and lobbyists for utilities and major manufacturers, who say that the Clean Air Act was never intended as a tool for fighting global warming. 
"This is a classic example of EPA staff saying we can manage the economy of the United States better than the president," said William Kovacs, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. 
The administration's critique will provide ample ammunition for opponents of strong greenhouse-gas curbs. Democrats in Congress have already struggled this year to find unity on how much to raise the cost of using fossil fuels, in the face of concerns from coal-state Democrats, representatives of auto making states, and allies of the oil industry. 
Earlier this month, during the debate on a climate-change bill in the Senate, opponents of the bill scored points by saying the legislation would raise gas prices, and cause huge job losses. 
The administration has argued that capping U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions could put the country at a steep competitive disadvantage relative to developing countries such as China and India, which don't operate under such caps. 
The administration has instead backed investments in clean-energy technologies, including renewable fuels, hydrogen fuel cells and advanced car batteries. Mr. Bush also signed a sweeping energy law last year that called for the biggest increase in automobile fuel- economy standards in a generation. 
Until last April's Supreme Court decision, the administration had argued that the agency lacked the authority to set limits on carbon dioxide. Following the court's ruling, the EPA spent months drafting a document that tentatively concludes that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare. 
The agency forwarded its endangerment finding in December to Ms. Dudley's office. But the document was never published, and a White House official asked the EPA to retract it, according to Jason Burnett, a senior EPA climate-change adviser at the time who has since left the agency. The same month, Mr. Johnson -- the EPA's administrator -- denied California permission to regulate greenhouse- gas emissions, despite a recommendation in favor of California's request by many of his top aides. That decision has prompted a lawsuit by California and more than a dozen other states that want to control such emissions. 
The administration's critics pointed to several portions of the final document that they said reflected an attempt by the administration to play down the benefits of combating global warming. 
For example, a draft version of the document that was obtained by The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets last month stated that "the net benefit to society" of controlling automobile carbon-dioxide emissions "could be in excess of $2 trillion." 
The document released on Friday, however, states that the "net present value to society could be on the order of $340 to $830 billion without considering benefits of GHG reductions," and estimates that gasoline prices will be just over $2 per gallon for the period 2010- 2020, a projection that critics called inappropriately low. Asked about the gasoline projection, an EPA spokesman said, "A draft is a draft and what we published today is the final" version. 
"This administration has turned its back on a golden economic opportunity, choosing instead to keep walking the path of costly delay," said Nathaniel Keohane, director of economic policy and analysis with the Environmental Defense Fund.

Abstract 
Concern about the program is spreading to the U.S. Doubts about the validity of some pollution-cutting projects in the developing world were one factor in the Senate's rejection last month of a bill that would have capped U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 

Full text 
A United Nations program designed to combat global warming has started doing something no one expected: It is subsidizing fossil-fuel power plants that spew millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually. 
In the past year or so, 13 big plants in India and China that burn natural gas have won the U.N.'s blessing as aids in the fight against climate change. As a result, owners of the plants earn millions of dollars a year from a U.N. program intended to spur construction of solar panels, wind turbines and other renewable-energy projects. 
This unforeseen turn is fanning new doubts about the environmental efficacy of the U.N.'s "carbon trading" program -- the most ambitious effort yet to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases where they're rising the fastest, in the developing world. 
Concern about the program is spreading to the U.S. Doubts about the validity of some pollution-cutting projects in the developing world were one factor in the Senate's rejection last month of a bill that would have capped U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The U.N. is now venturing further onto controversial turf. In recent months it has opened the door to subsidizing new coal-burning plants. Advocates argue that modern, cleaner-burning fossil-fuel technology is expensive, and without help paying for it, owners would build old- style plants that pollute more. 
U.N. officials strongly defend their approach. For more than a year, they have been taking a harder line in judging proposed emission- cutting projects of all stripes, they point out. And since the world is widely expected to continue to get most of its energy from fossil fuels for decades, U.N. officials say it's entirely appropriate for the program to subsidize plants that burn that fuel more cleanly. 
"Some of the countries in this world are endowed with fossil fuels," says Rajesh K. Sethi, an Indian government official who is chairman of the U.N. board that polices the subsidy program. "It is in the world's best interest that they use it as efficiently as possible." 
Critics say the U.N. program is straying from its purpose of promoting renewable-energy projects. "Coal is, like, climate enemy No. 1," says Michael Wara, a Stanford University lecturer who has published several papers criticizing the U.N. program. For every unit of power it produces, burning coal generates more greenhouse gas than burning natural gas. 
Mr. Wara argues that India and China are already building more- efficient plants anyway, since doing so makes economic sense at a time of rising energy prices. Using the U.N. program to subsidize these plants wastes money that could be used for other clean-energy projects. 
Despite growing talk of shifting away from fossil-fuel use, none of the world's big countries want to have to pay for that to happen. That strain was on display this week, as diplomats met in Japan to try to cobble together a more-forceful international agreement to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. 
On Tuesday, leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations set a goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2050, but made it nonbinding and didn't detail how they would meet it. On Wednesday, representatives of developing countries such as India and China declined to endorse even that loose target, saying it would hit their economies too hard. 
Among the coal plants seeking subsidies under the U.N. program is a $4 billion behemoth currently under construction in the western Indian state of Gujarat. When it is finished in 2012, it will be one of the biggest coal-fired plants in the world. 
The developer, Indian electricity producer Tata Power Co., is seeking about $36 million a year in subsidies, arguing that the alternative would have been to build a cheaper, less-efficient power plant. 
The U.N. hasn't yet officially considered Tata Power's application, but the proposal has powerful backers. Among them: The World Bank Group's International Finance Corp. and the Asian Development Bank, each of which has loaned Tata Power $450 million to fund the plant. 
"Let's be honest with ourselves," says Darius Lilaoonwala, senior manager of the International Finance Corp.'s power department. "These countries are going to need fossil-fueled electricity just like the U.S. and Europe. So let's encourage them to do the most-efficient technology possible." 
"Of course, if you build a coal factory, it's not good for the environment," adds Tsukasa Maekawa of the Asian Development Bank. But countries that have a lot of coal are going to burn it, he says, so helping them finance more-efficient plants makes sense. 
One of the fundamental principles of the U.N. initiative, called the Clean Development Mechanism, is that it should subsidize pollution- cutting projects only if they would otherwise be too expensive to build. The Tata Power plant, however, will be built whether or not it gets the U.N. program's financial aid. The power plant "has to go on. We've already started the project," says Prasad Menon, Tata Power's managing director. 
In addition, the Indian government essentially required the plant to use high-efficiency technology. Mr. Menon argues the project should still receive the U.N. subsidies because "it's a good move for the West to encourage India to move in this direction." 
This tension has dogged the international global-warming campaign since its inception. Under a 1997 treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, most industrialized countries other than the 
U.S. agreed to cap their greenhouse-gas emissions. They then required heavily polluting companies within their borders to cut their emissions over time. 
Developing countries didn't accept emission caps, arguing that stunting their economic growth to cope with a century's worth of pollution from the developed world would be unfair. As a compromise, the treaty created the Clean Development Mechanism, which aims to chip away at developing-world emissions one project at a time. 
Under the U.N. program, companies in wealthy nations can meet their environmental obligations at home by financing pollution-cutting projects in the developing world. Companies in the developing world get cash, while the companies in the West get "carbon credits" -- permission slips to continue coughing out their own carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The system is designed to curb world-wide emissions at the lowest possible cost. 
But the system works only if the developing-world projects actually cut emissions. If projects such as coal- and gas-fired plants India and China would have been built even without financial aid, then the U.N. program isn't actually cutting emissions. 
The U.N. has the job of assessing the environmental validity of developing-world projects that seek subsidies. But gauging whether a proposal actually cuts emissions is tricky. The U.N. board must make two judgment calls: whether the project would reduce the country's emissions below what they otherwise would be, and whether the project would have been built even without the U.N. subsidy. 
It's a "hypothetical thing," says Jose Domingos Gonzalez Miguez, a Brazilian government official on the U.N. board. "This is the problem." 
Every month or two, the board's 20 members fly to Bonn, Germany. There, in a U.N. high-rise, they meet for several days, poring over proposed projects. The meetings are posted on the Internet and watched by investors with big money riding on the decisions. 
The U.N. program was created to encourage renewable-energy projects. But in May 2006 the board approved the concept of letting gas-fired power plants sell carbon credits. A stream of gas-fired plants began applying. 
Three of the biggest plants sit near each other in the east China province of Zhejiang, near Shanghai. Construction on all three had begun before the U.N. board's decision. 
The owners of the three plants argued in their U.N. applications that the cheapest way for them to generate electricity would have been to build coal-burning plants. But because they had built more- efficient gas-fired plants, they argued, they deserved permission to sell a carbon credit for every extra ton of carbon dioxide that, according to their calculations, their plants would have emitted had they been built to burn coal. 
Together, the three plants were seeking permission to sell 2.7 million carbon credits each year. A credit represents permission to emit one ton of carbon dioxide a year. Given that such credits from developing countries are now selling for about $13 apiece, U.N. approval would translate into about $35.1 million a year for the owners of the three plants combined. 
The value of carbon credits from projects in the developing world was $7.4 billion last year, up 28% from 2006, according to the World Bank. Based on projects that have applied so far to sell carbon credits through 2012, when the Kyoto treaty's emission caps expire, fossil-fueled power plants account for only about 7% of the market, according to U.N. figures. But their share has been growing rapidly. 
The architects of the U.N. program hoped it would spark a renewable- energy revolution, inducing a shift away from fossil fuels and toward everything from the sun to the wind to animal waste. In fact, renewable energy accounts for only about one-third of the carbon credits proposed to be issued through 2012, according to U.N. figures. 
The owners of the three Chinese gas-fired plants worked with a broker that specializes in organizing carbon-credit projects. That firm, in turn, had hired a Norwegian auditing company, Det Norske Veritas, to certify that the plants' in-house emissions calculations were accurate. (The U.N. board authorizes auditors to do this kind of work on its behalf.) 
In early 2007, Det Norske Veritas recommended all three projects to the U.N. board. 
Today, Michael Lehmann, technical director for climate-change services at Det Norske Veritas, says he still believes the three Chinese power plants audited by his firm properly qualified for subsidies under the existing rules. But dozens of gas-fired plants in China are now rushing to snag carbon-credit revenue. That suggests the system "doesn't seem to be right any longer," he says -- it's unrealistic to think that none of them would be financially viable without the subsidies, particularly since so many are already built and running. 
Mr. Sethi, the U.N. board chairman, says each of the plants the board has approved complies with the rules as they exist. "Each project is seen on its own merits," he says, declining to say whether he thinks the higher-level diplomats who made that policy should change it. "We are simply the implementing tool," he says of the board he heads. 
Officials of the companies that own the three Chinese gas-fired plants defend their applications, saying they comply with the program's rules. "Gas is within [the] terms," says Li Jian, who works in the production technology department of one of the power companies, Zhejiang Guohua Yuyao Fuel Gas Power Generation Co. "So we got approved." 
The three plants' applications were still pending before the U.N. board when, in early 2007, two coal-fired plants applied for permission to sell carbon credits. That prompted several months of testy debate among members of the U.N. board, who were conscious of how politically controversial the idea was. 
Board members from developing countries that don't burn a lot of coal argued against approving the coal-fired plants. Mr. Miguez, the board member from Brazil, said it violated the U.N. program's intent. 
"This would create loopholes," he said. "We are here as the board of the Clean Development Mechanism. And I think we should stress the word 'clean.'" 
But members from countries that stood to gain from the proposal supported it. They included members from Canada and Japan -- both industrialized countries that accepted emission caps under the Kyoto treaty, and which therefore were hunting for cheap carbon credits to buy. Also supporting the applications from the coal plants were board members from India and China, two developing countries for whom domestic coal is a cheap energy source. 
The proposal would "be of very great use in countries like India and China," Mr. Sethi, the board member from India, told his colleagues during one of the meetings that was broadcast online. 
The board approved the coal proposal in September 2007, after adding provisions phasing out the rule over time and reducing the number of carbon credits any coal-fired plant could sell. 
A few months later, the board approved the three Chinese gas-fired power plants' applications to sell carbon credits. And Tata Power formally asked the board to approve the sale of carbon credits from the massive coal-fired plant the company was developing in Gujarat. 
Tata says the plant will emit an average of 26.7 million tons of carbon dioxide annually during its first decade of operation. That's 2.8 million fewer tons than the plant would discharge if it used the less-efficient coal-fired technology prevalent in India today, it says. So Tata is asking the U.N. to let it sell 2.8 million carbon credits annually. That would be worth about $36 million at current market prices. 
The Tata plant has its roots in an electrification push by the Indian government. The government had rolled out plans in early 2006 for about a half-dozen huge coal-fired power plants. Dubbed by the government the "ultra mega" plants, they would each be able to produce a sizable 4,000 megawatts of electricity. 
Tata Power's application to sell carbon credits is being reviewed by Det Norske Veritas, the auditing firm. The firm's Mr. Lehmann says he has his doubts about Tata's bid. "Look at the facts," he says. "The project has received funding. It's part of the policy of the government to implement this type of project," he says. Whether the plant needs carbon-market money "is really questionable." Mr. Lehmann says that the auditing firm is still looking into the project and hasn't yet made its recommendation. 
In May, a second Indian coal-fired plant applied for U.N. permission to sell carbon credits.

Abstract 
The U.S. has relied on the arc of domestic energy programs now in place, like fuel-economy standards and efficiency regulations, along with billions in subsidies for low-carbon technology. A British factory, say, buys a credit to pay for basic efficiency improvements in a Chinese coal plant, like installing smokestack scrubbers. 

Full Text 
One of the mysteries of the universe is why President Bush bothers to charge the fixed bayonets of the global warming theocracy. On the other hand, his Administration's supposed "cowboy diplomacy" is succeeding in changing the way the world addresses climate change. Which is to say, he has forced the world to pay at least some attention to reality. 
That was the larger meaning of the Group of Eight summit in Japan this week, even if it didn't make the papers. The headline was that the nations pledged to cut global greenhouse emissions by half by 2050. Yet for the first time, the G-8 also agreed that any meaningful climate program would have to involve industrializing nations like China and India. For the first time, too, the G-8 agreed that real progress will depend on technological advancements. And it agreed that the putative benefits had to justify any brakes on economic growth. 
In other words, the G-8 signed on to what has been the White House approach since 2002. The U.S. has relied on the arc of domestic energy programs now in place, like fuel-economy standards and efficiency regulations, along with billions in subsidies for low-carbon technology. Europe threw in with the central planning of the Kyoto Protocol -- and the contrast is instructive. Between 2000 and 2006, U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions fell 3%. Of the 17 largest world- wide emitters, only France reduced by more. 
So despite environmentalist sanctimony about the urgent need for President Bush and the U.S. to "take the lead" on global warming, his program has done better than most everybody else's. That won't make the evening news. But the fact is that the new G-8 document is best understood as a second look at the "leadership" of . . . you know who. 
The G-8 also tends to make grand promises that evaporate as soon as everyone goes home. This year, picking up the "accountability" theme pressed by the U.S., envoys grudgingly accepted a plan that will track -- and publicize -- how well countries are living up to their word. So when the G-8 endorsed greenhouse reduction "aspirations" that are "ambitious, realistic and achievable," the emphasis fell on the last two attributes. 
Put another way, global warming is an economic, not a theological, question. It is not at all clear that huge expenditures today on slowing emissions will yield long-run benefits or even slow emissions. Research and development into sources of low-carbon energy is almost certainly more useful, and the G-8 pledged more funding for "clean tech" programs. This is vastly preferable to whatever reorganization of the American economy that Barack Obama and John McCain currently favor in the name of solving this speculative problem. 
The G-8 also conceded that global-warming masochism is futile and painfully expensive. If every rich country drastically cut CO2, those cuts would be wiped out by emissions from China and India. "Carbon leakage" is a major problem too, where cutbacks in some countries lead to increases in others with less strict policies, as manufacturing and the like are outsourced. This whack-a-mole won't stop without including all 17 major economies, which together produce roughly 80% of global emissions. 
Much to the ire of Kyotophiles, Mr. Bush started this rethinking last year when he created a parallel track for talks on a post-2012 U.N. program, luring China and India to the table with more practical options. But developing countries, led by that duo, still refused to sign on to the G-8's 2050 goal. They aren't eager to endanger their growth -- and lifting people out of poverty -- by acquiring the West's climate neuroses. 
The irony is that Kyoto has handed them every reason not to participate. Europe knew all along that it couldn't meet its quotas, so it created an out in "offsets." A British factory, say, buys a credit to pay for basic efficiency improvements in a Chinese coal plant, like installing smokestack scrubbers. This is a tax on the Brits to make Chinese industries more competitive. Sweet deal if you can get it. 
It gets worse. The offsets are routed through a U.N. bureaucracy that makes them far more valuable in Europe than the cost of the actual efficiency improvements. So far, Kyoto-world has paid more than 4.7 billion euros to eliminate an obscure greenhouse gas called HFC- 23; the necessary incinerators cost less than 100 million euros. Most of the difference in such schemes goes to the foreign government, such as China's communist regime. 
Given these perverse incentives, the magical realism of Kyoto has backfired in a big way. The global warming elite will never admit this, because that would mean giving up their political whip against George Bush. But Kyoto II is already collapsing under its own contradictions. By sticking to a more realistic alternative, this reviled President has handed his green opponents a way to save face.

Abstract 
Rising energy prices and concerns about global warming are forcing Germany to rethink its decision to phase out nuclear power, a policy that threatens to make Europe's biggest economy more dependent on high-polluting coal or Russian natural gas. 

Full text 
BERLIN -- Rising energy prices and concerns about global warming are forcing Germany to rethink its decision to phase out nuclear power, a policy that threatens to make Europe's biggest economy more dependent on high-polluting coal or Russian natural gas. 
Conservatives in Chancellor Angela Merkel's squabbling coalition want Germany to freeze its phase-out of nuclear-power plants, echoing a revival of support for nuclear energy in many European countries. 
But Ms. Merkel's coalition partners, the left-leaning Social Democrats, want her to stick to a pact to shut down the country's last nuclear power plants by 2021 -- a concession she made to bring the party into a coalition government. 
Germany's political left and its strong environmentalist movement view atomic energy as unsafe. Street protests against nuclear power and nuclear weapons in the 1970s spawned Europe's powerful Green Party. 
In 2000, a government of Greens and Social Democrats agreed to the nuclear exit strategy with Germany's energy utilities. But since then, climate change and the short supply of oil and natural gas have moved to the center of the energy debate. Ms. Merkel found herself isolated at the Group of Eight leading nations' summit in Japan this week. The U.S., U.K., France and other G-8 members are pushing greater use of nuclear power as an important way to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists blame for global warming. 
At the summit, President George W. Bush's chief environmental adviser, James Connaughton, called support for nuclear power "a litmus test for seriousness on climate change." Ms. Merkel said she didn't think protecting the climate depended only on nuclear power. 
Ms. Merkel has said she thinks Germany's nuclear phase-out is wrong, but that she is bound by her coalition agreement with the Social Democrats. Many in her conservative Christian Democrat camp hope to scrap the antinuclear policy if they win national elections in 2009. Bavarian conservative leader Erwin Huber is pushing to make the move even earlier. This week he called on Social Democrats to "say farewell to the disastrous mistake of their collaboration with the Greens." 
Social Democrats say they might agree to prolong the life of the most modern reactors by a few years if conservatives agree to a constitutional amendment banning the construction of any new reactors. But they are struggling to explain how losing nuclear energy fits with Germany's self-styled role as a global leader for cutting carbon emissions. 
Germany gets 22% of its electricity supply from nuclear energy, around half from coal and the rest mostly from natural gas and renewable sources such as wind. The country is investing heavily in wind and solar power and is drawing up laws that require higher energy efficiency in buildings and transport. 
But many experts doubt wind and solar power can compensate for lost nuclear energy and meet Germany's ambitious carbon-cutting goals at the same time. "More use of coal and gas will have to replace nuclear power," says Claudia Kemfert, head of energy studies at the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. 
Natural gas is getting costlier along with oil, and greater use will make Germany even more reliant on supplies from Russia, she says. Coal-fired power stations emit the most greenhouse gases -- especially those using lignite or brown coal, which Germany has in abundance, unlike oil, natural gas or sunshine. Keeping nuclear plants operating would win time to build up renewable energy and develop the technology to capture and store carbon emissions from burning coal, Ms. Kemfert says. 
Nuclear opponents insist that isn't necessary and point to nuclear energy's drawbacks, despite signs that it is making a comeback in many countries. An international nuclear boom could quickly deplete the world's uranium supplies, and nobody has a good solution for where to put radioactive waste, says the Social Democrats' deputy parliamentary leader, Ulrich Kelber. 
A uranium leak from a power plant in southern France on Tuesday, which forced regional authorities to ban drinking local water, swimming, eating fish and irrigating crops, underscored nuclear energy's environmental risks, Mr. Kelber said. 
In Germany, the specter of a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster hangs over public debate on nuclear power. The 1986 explosion at the Ukrainian power plant accelerated a trend in the 1980s of countries opting out of nuclear power.

Abstract 
The most common manmade greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is belched out whenever fossil fuel -- such as oil, natural gas or coal -- is burned. 

Full text 
Leaders of the Group of Eight major industrialized economies, meeting in Japan, issued their first long-term target for cutting global-warming emissions. But their pronouncement failed to address the two toughest questions: How will the world do it, and who will pay? 
The answer to the money question is clear: Consumers will pay -- at the gasoline pump, at the car dealership and on the monthly electric bill. If the campaign against global warming gets serious, it will transform today's esoteric environmental threat into a fundamental pocketbook issue for people from Boston to Beijing. 
But how much it will cost and how much it will do for the planet depend on the gritty details of how policy makers decide to attack greenhouse-gas emissions. Those details were in short supply this week, because the diplomats disagree -- and because nobody knows. 
G-8 leaders on Tuesday set a goal to halve greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. The most common manmade greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is belched out whenever fossil fuel -- such as oil, natural gas or coal -- is burned. Slashing the current level of greenhouse-gas emissions without injuring the global economy would likely require a range of technologies that today are still in the lab. 
A separate diplomatic group that met on Wednesday and that included representatives from developing nations declined to endorse even the G-8's broad goal. Fast-growing countries like China and India don't want to commit themselves to an emissions-cut target, saying rich countries should ante up first. 
Reaching the G-8's goal would go a long way toward preventing dangerous consequences from global warming but not all the way, according to many scientists. Some have called for even deeper cuts. 
Many studies have tried to quantify what this would cost. A United Nations panel, for instance, said last year that reducing greenhouse- gas emissions enough to avoid the worst consequences could cut projected global economic output in 2030 by as much as 3% below the level it would otherwise reach that year. 
Whether that is a reasonable price is a matter of debate. But even those who think the cost is worth it admit such studies have two whopping caveats. 
The studies assume the world will cut emissions in the most economically rational way. And the studies acknowledge that the cost will hit some countries, companies and consumers harder than others. 
The cost is "meaningful, but not devastating, to the economy," says Scott Nyquist, a director and co-head of the energy practice at consulting firm McKinsey & Co., which recently has issued several studies of the cost of curbing emissions. "But the point is, there are individual parts of the world that get hit harder." Consumers in countries -- or regions within them -- that rely more heavily on coal, for example, would likely face bigger increases in energy prices. 
Two hints that consumers will significantly bear the costs of fighting global warming have cropped up in recent weeks. 
One came from California, which proposed new rules in late June to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Among the measures California is considering is a fee of between $10 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide that is emitted. Translation: a potential increase in the wholesale price of gasoline of between 10 cents and 50 cents per gallon, the state said. 
Congress also recently acknowledged that it will have to provide financial help for consumers if it is to make cutting greenhouse gases politically feasible. 
In early June, the Senate considered and rejected what broadly amounted to a mandatory U.S. version of the G-8's nonbinding global pledge. The bill sought to cut U.S. emissions about 65% from current levels by 2050. Included in the bill was a provision for tax relief for Americans whose bills for coal-fired electricity would rise as a result. 
Among the few specifics in the G-8 proposal was for more research and development of new technologies to burn coal more cleanly. Many of the world's biggest economies have huge stores of coal buried within their borders. As energy prices soar, these countries intend to burn more of that coal than ever before. 
That suggests the debate over what to do about global warming is about to get a lot more personal for consumers, says Billy Pizer, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank that focuses on energy issues. The relatively easy step is setting broad goals for emission cuts decades hence. But whatever progress that represents doesn't answer the stubborn question, he says: "What are we actually going to do?"

Abstract 
White House negotiator Dan Price said the statement represented "significant progress" for its recognition that the developed world can't solve global warming on its own and for its emphasis on the need for new technologies. The Bush administration has long argued that any replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and set to expire in 2012, won't be effective unless it includes the emerging economies. 

Full text 
RUSUTSU, Japan -- The Group of Eight leading nations formally endorsed a goal of halving global greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Seeking to secure the participation of fast-growing developing countries, the group also promised "ambitious" cuts in emissions over the next two decades and large investments in clean-energy technology. 
White House negotiator Dan Price said the statement represented "significant progress" for its recognition that the developed world can't solve global warming on its own and for its emphasis on the need for new technologies. 
But the goal's success could depend on winning hard-to-secure commitments from fast-growing emerging economies to implement unprecedented pollution reductions of their own. A critical test will be if such nations can enter into a treaty for a global system of limits in the coming year. Meanwhile, environmentalists said the declaration failed to set meaningful near-term limits. 
Major developing countries such as China and India are scheduled to engage old-line G-8 powers in negotiations Wednesday. The G-8 includes the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United Kingdom. 
The Bush administration has long argued that any replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and set to expire in 2012, won't be effective unless it includes the emerging economies. These countries aren't covered by Kyoto, but their rapid growth means they are a growing source of such emissions. The G-8 leaders' statement said that "to ensure an effective and ambitious global post-2012 climate regime, all major economies will need to commit" to "meaningful" reduction plans in the next treaty. 
The emerging economies argue that most of the buildup of greenhouse gases is the developed world's fault. They also fear the impact that limits could have on their own development. 
The emerging economies' leaders issued a statement calling for developed countries to pledge to cut emissions at least 25% to 40% by 2020 and 80% to 95% by 2050. 
A senior U.S. official said the statement reflected an opening bid. The official predicted "modest" progress across the board at Wednesday's meeting, including on emissions reductions in the emerging economies' industrial sectors. Other expected attendees include Australia, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. 
Tuesday's developments suggest negotiations over a successor to the Kyoto Protocol likely will continue to see the developed and developing worlds facing off, with many emerging economies seeking to avoid binding limits on their emissions. But they also show how the two sides are gradually coming closer together. United Nations officials hope to conclude a treaty by the end of 2009. 
Even if there is no breakthrough agreement Wednesday, the G-8 declaration allows President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, host of this year's G-8 and a U.S. ally on climate change, to claim a political victory, after years of U.S. skepticism about global targets. Although the 50%-reduction goal is nonbinding, many experts regard it as essential to preventing the worst effects of climate change. 
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso praised the outcome. "Without a big step of the United States, you cannot achieve an agreement," he told reporters. 
The statement also represented vindication for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a former scientist and climate negotiator who has been the highest-profile proponent of the goal of halving emissions by 2050. Under her influence as G-8 host last year, the G-8 countries said they would "seriously consider" the goal of cutting emissions by 50% by 2050. 
The statement's broad language opens the door for a deal between the developed and developing countries. It says developing countries can undertake different commitments from those of the developed world and calls for the industrialized economies to bear more of the burden for the foreseeable future. 
"We recognize that what the major developed economies do will differ from what major developing economies do," the statement said. Leaders also acknowledged "our leadership role" and promised ambitious, economy-wide midterm goals. G-8 countries also pledged to pay billions of dollars to develop new technologies to reduce emissions and to help emerging economies buy them. 
The Bush administration has put emphasis on developing clean-coal technologies for power generation and automobile batteries that depend on electricity. 
Some environmentalists rejected the statement as all but meaningless. 
"What was needed was a clear signal that the world's major industrialized countries would provide real leadership in cutting their own emissions . . . between now and 2020," said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He suggested that the Bush administration, which has set a goal of halting emissions growth by 2025, continues to hold up the process. 
Other critics noted that the statement's wording would give the developed world a significant break, allowing it to measure future reductions from 2008. The Kyoto Protocol measures percentage changes from 1990, a tougher baseline for many countries. Some also criticized the vagueness of the statement, particularly concerning the G-8 countries' plans for midterm emissions reductions. 
Phil Clapp of the Pew Environmental Group said the emerging economies will likely seek greater specificity on the developed world's commitments to midterm reductions and details on what will be demanded of them. 
The emerging economies might prefer to strike a deal with President Bush now, rather than with a successor who might seek bigger concessions.

The Market Is Responding to the Oil Shock

Abstract 
Developed countries would grow less dependent on oil producers, and transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions could ease (even coal- fired power plants are better than millions of gasoline-powered autos). 

Full Text 
The leaders of the G-8 and of major developing countries will discuss how to respond to energy security and climate change tomorrow. Their first instinct will likely be to propose new regulations. Yet market forces may already be solving these problems, as high oil prices drive a shift away from the polluting, petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine to cleaner forms of transportation. 
That's a change worth cheering, even if oil prices are painful in the meantime. Oil is the United States' principal transportation fuel, and the source of a third of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Other major countries are similarly dependent on oil for transportation. As prices have risen, worries about energy security and long-term climate effects have reached a fever pitch. 
History teaches that innovation directed by markets can solve problems such as these. In New York at the end of the 19th century, horses were the main form of transport -­and a major source of pollution. As many as 200,000 horses each produced 15 to 35 pounds of manure per day. Manure piles along the roads and in stables produced vast numbers of flies, an important vector for infectious diseases such as typhoid fever. Horses became increasingly expensive, thanks to rising prices for hay, oats and the urban land required for stables. 
Initially the automobile wasn't much competition for the horse. Then, around the turn of the century, a series of innovations involving the internal combustion engine and manufacturing (mass production, assembly lines and interchangeable parts) improved performance, reliability and costs. As car prices fell, the horse, the manure and the "typhus fly" were done for. 
The same thing may be happening today. This March, American entrepreneur Elon Musk started production of his electric sports car, the Tesla. This car accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds, tops out at 125 mph, and has a range of 220 miles. The $110,000 price tag limits the Tesla to the wealthy, but mass- production models are in the works. General Motors has committed itself to rolling out its electronic vehicle, the Volt, by 2010. Toyota plans a successor to its popular Prius hybrid. 
Recent cost comparisons by Deutsche Bank's auto analysts suggest electric cars will be cheaper to operate than conventional vehicles. Fuel costs per mile for gasoline-fueled cars are $0.27 in Germany, $0.24 in Britain, $0.17 in Brazil and $0.11 in the U.S., with differences driven by local fuel taxes. For electric vehicles, the cost per mile is a mere $0.02. Adding in a battery amortized over the life of the car, the cost is still only $0.10. Batteries will be expensive, at least in early years, but electric cars won't need costly engines or complex transmissions like today's autos. 
Cost differentials like those could drive a quick transition to energy-efficient forms of transportation. There would surely be failures along the way -- even Henry Ford had a couple of flops and an encounter with bankruptcy before making it big with the Model T. And it would take a while to replace the existing transportation fleet made up of cars that last 15 years. 
Nonetheless, incremental effects on oil demand could be powerful. Developed countries would grow less dependent on oil producers, and transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions could ease (even coal- fired power plants are better than millions of gasoline-powered autos). As costs fall, electric vehicles could be adopted in developing countries, amplifying energy security and climate benefits. 
The transition would reduce the world's dependence on regimes run by thugs and theocrats. More than 80% of proven reserves are controlled by national oil companies and Russian firms, which don't operate like normal profit-maximizing businesses. (Witness Russian threats to turn off gas supplies to Ukraine and Eastern Europe.) High oil prices have corrupted countries with weak institutions and reinforced misbehavior of international miscreants such as Iran and Venezuela. 
Regulation and taxes can of course shape market incentives. But regulation comes with unintended consequences -- the more complex the regulation (think cap-and-trade), the more scope for undesired consequences. High oil prices, as unpleasant as they are, are making a lot of alternative energy and transportation technologies look attractive. The petroleum-powered auto has provided affordable independence to millions for a century, but has brought its own problems. Innovation and markets could well send the internal combustion engine and its oil-related worries the way of the horse and buggy. 
Mr. Hunter, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, was a senior director at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, responsible for international economics.

WSJ Roundup 
In a decision with potentially significant ramifications for power companies and the national debate over global warming, a state court in Georgia ruled Monday that a proposed coal-burning power plant can't proceed unless its carbon-dioxide emissions are limited. 
The ruling against a proposed 1200-megawatt power plant in Early County, Ga., marks the first time that a judge has applied a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on global warming to emissions from an industrial source, environmental groups said. David Byford, a spokesman for Houston-based Dynegy Inc., which is developing the project with LS Power Group of East Brunswick, N.J., said, "We're disappointed in the ruling and we're planning an appeal." 
The Supreme Court's April 2007 decision required the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether carbon dioxide -- the greenhouse gas most blamed for global warming -- endangers public health or welfare, the legal criteria to be regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. Citing concerns about the impact of such an action on the U.S. economy, the Bush administration has yet to formally issue that declaration, however, and officials in some states have begun to fill the void by setting their own policies aimed at curbing carbon-dioxide emissions. 
The decision in the Georgia case centers on what would be Georgia's first new coal-fired plant in more than two decades, a facility that would emit up to nine million tons of carbon dioxide annually. In defending the project, lawyers representing the plant's developers have noted that there is no federal standard yet to reduce carbon- dioxide emissions, and warned that a ruling to regulate the gas would "short-circuit" the efforts of federal policy makers in Washington to develop new rules. 
The judge, Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore of the Fulton County Superior Court, rejected those arguments Monday, calling the developers' position "untenable." 
Environmental groups said they planned to use the Georgia court's ruling to hold up about 30 other proposed coal plants that are subject to litigation. 
"We will be taking this decision and making the same arguments to push for an end to conventional coal," said Bruce Nilles, who oversees the Sierra Club's National Coal Campaign. The plant's developers, LS Power Group and Dynegy, were reviewing the ruling and didn't have an immediate comment. 
Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a Washington-based group that represents power companies, said the Georgia court's ruling was inconsistent with recent decisions in other states that have allowed work on proposed coal-fired power plants to proceed.

Abstract 
British Energy PLC, the company that owns and operates eight of Britain's nuclear power stations, almost went bankrupt in 2002 when wholesale energy prices collapsed. When the deadline for bids came last month, France's EDF SA was the only company to make a formal offer, though bankers say Spain's Iberdrola SA, Germany's RWE AG, and Centrica PLC, the U.K.'s largest retail energy supplier, were also interested.

LONDON -- Can nuclear power work in Europe's most deregulated energy market? 
That's the question confronting the United Kingdom as it gives the go-ahead for a new generation of nuclear plants to replace the nine due to be retired by 2023. In January, Britain's minister for business said that with the new-build program, nuclear's share in Britain's electricity generation -- currently about 20% -- could rise "significantly." He said he wanted the U.K. to become the "No. 1 place in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power." 
Yet in many ways, the program is a leap in the dark. "No one's built a nuclear power plant in this country since we liberalized [deregulated] the market," says Paul Spare, an adviser to the Supporters of Nuclear Energy, a lobbying group. "It's going to be a rocky road." 
The U.K. is not the only country pushed by the twin imperatives of energy security and climate change to restart its nuclear program. But while there's usually strong state backing for nuclear power, especially in countries like China, India and Korea, Britain is different. In the Nuclear White Paper it published in January, the government said there would be no caps on the number of new reactors, and left it up to the market to decide how many should be built. But taxpayers wouldn't be providing a penny in subsidies -­not even for the exorbitant cost of decommissioning and waste disposal. 
Boosters hope the British experiment will prove nuclear can compete on equal terms with fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. Environmental campaigners say that's a pipe dream. "No commercial nuclear power program has ever existed anywhere in the world without state support," says Ben Ayliffe of Greenpeace. "You're living in cloud cuckoo land if you expect the U.K. to be any different." 
The experience so far of private investment in nuclear is mixed. In one of the first projects in Europe financed entirely by the private sector, Areva SA of France and Germany's Siemens AG are building a new-generation pressurized-water reactor at Olkiluoto in Finland, backed by a consortium of power and industrial companies. But the project is about two years behind schedule and heavily over budget. 
The U.K.'s history of privatized nuclear energy also hardly inspires confidence. British Energy PLC, the company that owns and operates eight of Britain's nuclear power stations, almost went bankrupt in 2002 when wholesale energy prices collapsed. A last-minute government rescue package was arranged, valued at GBP 5.3 billion ($10.7 billion at today's exchange rates). 
The U.K. government put its 35% stake in British Energy up for sale earlier this year, and some of Europe's biggest utilities initially lined up to take a look. The company's operational performance has been patchy and its reactors unreliable -- four of the 15 in service are currently closed and under repair for technical problems. Still, British Energy controls access to most of the preferred sites for new power stations, so it's seen as key to any plans for nuclear's future in Britain. 
When the deadline for bids came last month, France's EDF SA was the only company to make a formal offer, though bankers say Spain's Iberdrola SA, Germany's RWE AG, and Centrica PLC, the U.K.'s largest retail energy supplier, were also interested. But on June 9 British Energy said that none of the takeover offers it had received offered value for shareholders. 
The international interest in British Energy, meanwhile, has highlighted another issue as well: Is it permissible for all of Britain's power-generating assets to end up in foreign hands? The U.K. electricity industry is already dominated by overseas giants: Germany's E.ON AG acquired Powergen, the U.K.'s third-biggest power supplier, in 2002, and Iberdrola bought Scottish Power PLC in 2006. EDF has snapped up U.K. electricity companies and power stations as well, and now distributes electricity and gas to homes across Britain. 
EDF, the world's largest nuclear power generator, has said it wants to build as many as four nuclear power stations in Britain. It has already purchased land next to existing British plants with a view to building new reactors at the sites. 
Britain's government says there's no reason why its laissez-faire approach to energy shouldn't extend to nuclear. "It would be nice if an Englishman played for Arsenal Football Club, but nevertheless we're champions of globalization," Malcolm Wicks, the U.K. minister for energy, says in an interview. "We're getting well used to the idea that major [international] companies are major players in the U.K." 
But the prospect of selling Britain's nuclear crown jewels to a state-owned company like EDF has stirred passions. "If we don't believe in having national champions for Britain, why are we content for another country's national champion to buy us up?" says Alan Duncan, the opposition Conservative Party's spokesman on business. "This could mean we'd have less and less British ownership of British energy." Analysts say the government may address those concerns by letting Centrica take a minority stake in British Energy, if it is acquired by EDF. 
The key factor in the new economics of nuclear energy will be the price of carbon. The EU's Emission Trading Scheme allows industrial companies, including power generators, to buy and sell allowances to emit carbon dioxide. The first phase of the scheme was a failure -- governments handed out so many allowances that the price of carbon fell too low: There was no pressure on companies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
The EU is now tightening up the Emission Trading Scheme. From single digits in 2006 the price of carbon has climbed to around 24 euros a ton this year. But it needs to go higher to provide incentives for nuclear, says Adam McCarthy of Energy Policy Consulting, a private consulting firm in Brussels. "People want to know they're not going to be undercut by other forms of power generation" like coal and natural gas, he says. 
Ministers have pledged to improve Britain's regulatory system so planning approvals can be granted and reactor designs licensed more quickly. They've also said they'll make sure enough sites can be made available for new power stations. 
The power generators themselves will still have to pay for nuclear- waste disposal and reactor decommissioning, but they are cooperating with the government on a system that will require them to set aside sufficient funds for this -- though at this point no one is sure what those costs will be. 
Greenpeace fears that the price will be set too low, and that U.K. taxpayers will end up having to pay the difference. "It's inconceivable to say in 2008 that we know how much it's going to cost in 50 or 100 years' time to get rid of the waste," says Mr. Ayliffe. "We still don't even know whether it's going to be stored or buried." A spokesman for the government says that "companies will have additional security in place to supplement the funds should they be insufficient." 
In any case, investors may need more encouragement than this to dip their toes in the U.K. The liberalized energy market in Britain means power generation, distribution and supply are all separate, unlike in some European countries, such as France. The British market is one of the most efficient and competitive in Europe. But it also exposes operators to price volatility of a kind that can undermine long-term investments. 
Mr. Spare, the nuclear-energy adviser, says Britain's nuclear roll- out will only work if power generators, retail electricity suppliers and big industrial consumers come together to hammer out long-term contracts that guarantee stable prices. 
"You'd want a customer base committed to buying your electricity over a 10-year time frame," says Mr. Spare. "Without that, you don't have a secure future."

Abstract 
Scientists agree that greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, are building up in the atmosphere and contributing to a gradual increase in global average temperatures. Even when taking into account "full life-cycle emissions" -- including mining of uranium, shipping fuel, constructing plants and managing waste -- nuclear's carbon-dioxide discharges are comparable to the full life-cycle emissions of wind and hydropower and less than solar power. 

Full Text 
Is nuclear power the answer for a warming planet? Or is it too expensive and dangerous to satisfy future energy needs? 
Interest in nuclear power is heating up, as the hunt intensifies for "green" alternatives to fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. Even some environmentalists have come on 
board, citing the severity of the global-warming threat to explain their embrace of the once-maligned power source. 
But the issue is far from settled. Proponents insist that nuclear is a necessary alternative in an energy-constrained world. They say that the economics make sense -- and that 

the public has a warped image of the safety risks, thanks to Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and "The China Syndrome." Opponents, meanwhile, are convinced that the costs are 
way too high to justify the safety hazards, as well as the increased risks of proliferation. 
Has nuclear's time come? The debate rages on. 
NUCLEAR'S THE ANSWER 
The argument for nuclear power can be stated pretty simply: We have no choice. 

If the world intends to address the threat of global warming and still satisfy its growing appetite for electricity, it needs an ambitious expansion of nuclear power. 
Scientists agree that greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, are building up in the atmosphere and contributing to a gradual increase in global average temperatures. At the 
same time, making electricity accounts for about a third of U.S. greenhouse emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce power. 

Nuclear power plants, on the other hand, emit virtually no carbon dioxide -- and no sulfur or mercury either. Even when taking into account "full life-cycle emissions" -- including mining of uranium, shipping fuel, constructing plants and managing waste -- nuclear's carbon-dioxide discharges are comparable to the full life-cycle emissions of wind and hydropower and less than solar power. 
Nuclear power, of course, isn't the only answer. We need to get more energy from other nonpolluting sources such as solar and wind. Conservation is crucial. So is using 
technology to make more efficient use of fossil-fuel power. 
But we have to be realistic about the limits of these alternatives. As it is, the 104 nuclear power plants in the U.S. generate about a fifth of the nation's energy. Wind accounts 
for about 1%, and solar even less than that. Any increase in the number of nuclear power plants can help -- even if they won't solve the whole problem. 

More important from the standpoint of displacing fossil fuel, nuclear can meet power demand 24 hours a day. Solar and wind can't do that. Nuclear is the only current 
technology that fits the bill. 
So, what's the case against nuclear power? It boils down to two things: economics and safety. 
Neither holds up to scrutiny. 

First, economics. Critics argue that the high cost of building and financing a new plant makes nuclear power uneconomical when compared with other sources of power. 
But that's misleading on a number of levels. One reason it's so expensive at this point is that no new plant has been started in the U.S. since the last one to begin construction 
in 1977. Lenders -- uncertain how long any new plant would take because of political and regulatory delays -- are wary of financing the first new ones. So financing costs are 
unusually high. As we build more, the timing will be more predictable, and financing costs will no doubt come down as lenders become more comfortable. 

Loan guarantees and other federal incentives are needed to get us over this hump. They are not permanent subsidies for uneconomical ventures. Instead, they're limited to the first half dozen of plants as a way to reassure investors that regulatory delays won't needlessly hold up construction. It's important to remember that although nuclear energy has been around a while, it's hardly a "mature" industry, as some critics say. Because of the lack of new plants in so many years, nuclear in many ways is more like an emerging technology, and so subsidies make sense to get it going. 
It's also true that a shortage of parts and skills is raising the cost of new plants. But if we start building more plants, the number of companies supplying parts will increase to 
meet the demand, lowering the price. 
Most important, nuclear power appears economically uncompetitive primarily because the price of "cheaper" fossil fuels, mainly coal, don't reflect the high cost that carbon 
emissions pose for the environment. Add those costs, and suddenly, nuclear power will look like a bargain. 

That's likely to happen soon. Governments are expected to assign a cost to greenhouse gases, through either a direct tax (based on the carbon content of a fuel) or a so-called cap-and-trade system, which would set a limit on emissions while allowing companies whose discharges are lower than the cap to sell or trade credits to companies whose pollution exceeds the cap. 
Suddenly, big carbon polluters like coal-produced electricity are going to look a lot more expensive compared with low-carbon sources -- in particular, nuclear, wind and hydropower. 
It's estimated that a carbon "price" of between $25 and $50 a ton makes nuclear power economically competitive with coal. That should be enough to ease investor concerns about utilities that build new nuclear plants. 
Even without a carbon tax, rising natural-gas prices are beginning to make nuclear power more competitive. That's true even in some deregulated markets, such as Texas. 
NRG Energy Inc., based in Princeton, N.J., has filed an application to build a reactor adjacent to an existing plant in Texas. Though it's too early to know how much the plant will eventually cost -- or even if it ultimately will get built -- high natural-gas prices alone are enough to justify construction, according to NRG. 
One other point on cost: Solar and wind advocates say these sources are cheaper than nuclear -- and getting cheaper. But again, even if true, the intermittent nature of these sources make them flawed replacements for carbon-emitting sources. Nuclear is the only clean- energy way to address that gap. 
Let's turn to the critics' other argument: safety. We're still living in a world whose viewpoints have been warped by the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine, as well as by the anti-nuclear movie "The China Syndrome." 
The truth is that there's little doubt that in the U.S., at least, plants are much safer now than they were in the past. Those accidents led regulators and the industry to bolster safety at U.S. nuclear plants. There are more safety features at the plants, plant personnel are better trained, and reactors have been redesigned so that accidents are far less likely to occur. For instance, every U.S. plant has an on-site control-room simulator where employees can hone their skills and handle simulated emergencies, and plant workers spend one week out of every six in the simulator or in the classroom. 
The next generation of plants is designed to be even safer, using fewer pumps and piping and relying more on gravity to move water for cooling the hot nuclear core. This means fewer possible places where equipment failure could cause a serious accident. 
And even if a serious accident does occur, U.S. plants are designed to make sure that no radiation is released into the environment. Reactors are contained inside a huge structure of reinforced concrete with walls that are as much as four feet thick; the Chernobyl reactor lacked such a structure. 
What's more, you can't look at safety in a vacuum. Consider the hazards of the world's reliance on coal-fired plants: Coal mining world-wide results in several thousand deaths every year, most of them in China, and burning coal is a leading source of mercury in the atmosphere. 
Furthermore, look at safety more broadly -- from an environmental perspective. The death and destruction stemming from global warming far exceed what is likely to happen if there is a nuclear accident. And yet, when we talk about safety, we seem to focus only on the risks of nuclear power. 
The long-term disposal of nuclear waste is also a problem -- but it's mainly a policy issue, not a technical one. 
Most experts agree that the best way to dispose of waste is deep underground, where radioactive materials can be prevented from entering the environment and where it can be guarded against theft or terrorist attack. In the U.S., the Energy Department picked Yucca Mountain in southwestern Nevada for a repository, but political wrangling has so far blocked proceeding with the site, and final approval is considered a long shot. Even if approved, it won't be able to begin accepting waste for a decade or more. 
In the meantime, interim storage in deep pools next to nuclear plants is considered sufficiently safe to meet the industry's needs until well into the future. The amount of waste produced is relatively small; all the waste produced so far in the U.S. would only cover a football field about five yards deep. Older, cooler fuel can also be stored for decades in dry casks. 
Longer term, advanced fuel recycling and reprocessing can reduce the amount of waste that needs to be stored. While reprocessing wouldn't eliminate the need for a long-term repository, it can reduce the amount, heat and radioactivity of the remaining waste. 
Finally, critics say that an expansion of nuclear power will increase the danger that potentially hostile nations will use nuclear material from a power program to develop atomic weapons, or that rogue states or terrorists will steal nuclear material to make bombs. 
While nonproliferation is an important consideration, the proliferation problem won't be solved by turning away from nuclear power. 
To curtail these risks, governments need to strengthen current international anti-proliferation efforts to, among other things, give the International Atomic Energy Agency more information about a country's nuclear-related activities and IAEA inspectors greater access to suspect locations. Further, current fuel-reprocessing techniques are limited and new processing technologies are being developed to limit the amount and accessibility of weapons-grade materials (by, for instance, producing a form of plutonium that needs further reprocessing before it could be used in bombs). 
One final point about security: One of the biggest dangers to our security is from oil nations providing support to anti-U.S. terrorist groups. The faster we can move away from carbon-based energy, the faster we take away that funding source. Nuclear energy offers the fastest and most direct path to that safer future. 
NO TO NUCLEAR 
Nuclear power isn't a solution to global warming. Rather, global warming is just a convenient rationale for an obsolete energy source that makes no sense when compared to the alternatives. 
Sure, nuclear power generates lots of electricity while producing virtually no carbon dioxide. But it still faces the same problems that have stymied the development of new nuclear plants for the past 20 years -- exorbitant costs, the risks of an accident or terrorist attack, the threat of proliferation and the challenge of disposing of nuclear waste. 
The cost issue alone will mean that few if any new nuclear power stations will get built in the next few years, at least in the U.S., and any that do will require expensive taxpayer subsidies. Instead of subsidizing the development of new plants that have all these other problems, the U.S. would be better off investing in other ways to meet growing energy demands and reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. 
In fact, the sheer number of nuclear plants needed to make a major dent in greenhouse emissions means the industry hasn't a prayer of turning nuclear power into the solution to global warming. One study from last year determined that to make a significant contribution toward stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide, about 21 new 1,000- megawatt plants would have to be built each year for the next 50 years, including those needed to replace existing reactors, all of which are expected to be retired by 2050. That's considerably more than the most ambitious industry growth projections. 
But let's start with the biggest problem with nuclear power: the cost. 
While no one knows what a new reactor will cost until one gets built, estimates for new construction continue to rise. Building a new plant could cost as much as $6,000 a kilowatt of generating capacity, up from estimates of about $4,000 a kilowatt just a year ago. FPL Group, of Juno Beach, Fla., estimates that two new reactors planned for southeast Florida would cost between $6 billion and $9 billion each. 
Part of the reason for the rising cost estimates is the small number of vendors able to supply critical reactor components, as well as a shortage of engineering and construction skills in the nuclear industry. Perhaps the biggest bottleneck is in the huge reactor vessels that contain a plant's radioactive core. Only one plant in the world is capable of forging the huge vessels in a single piece, and it can produce only a handful of the forgings a year. Though the plant intends to expand capacity in the next couple of years, and China has said it plans to begin making the forgings, this key component is expected to limit development for many years. 
The only way to make nuclear power economically competitive would be the imposition of steep "prices" on carbon-emitting power sources. Nobody knows precisely how high those prices would have to go -- there are too many variables to consider. But estimates range as high as $60 a ton of carbon dioxide. This imposes an unacceptably high price on consumers. 
More important, though, there are less-costly ways of weaning ourselves off these carbon-emitting energy sources. Even if a high price of carbon makes nuclear economic, the costs of renewable energy such as wind and solar power are cheaper, and getting cheaper all the time. By contrast, nuclear is more expensive, and getting more expensive all the time. Solving a Problem 
And yes, it's true that wind and solar suffer from the problem of not being available 24 hours a day. But new technology is already beginning to solve that problem. And we'd be better off -- from both an economic and safety standpoint -- if we used natural gas to fill in the gaps, rather than nuclear. 
Subsidies to the industry distort the financial picture further. In the U.S., Washington assumes liability for any catastrophic damages above $10.5 billion for an accident, and has taken on responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste. The 1995 federal Energy Policy Act also provides loan guarantees for as much as 80% of the cost of new reactors and additional financial guarantees of up to $2 billion for costs arising from regulatory delays. 
The 1995 act saw subsidies as a way to prime the pump of a nuclear- energy revival in the U.S.; increased demand and a stable regulatory environment would ultimately reduce the cost of building new plants. However, the industry for 50 years has shown only a trend toward higher costs, and there's no evidence that subsidies will spur any reduction in those costs. 
And besides, if nuclear power is such a great deal, it should be able to stand on its own, and not require such subsidies from the taxpayer. Government subsidies should sponsor research and development into new or emerging energy technologies where prices are already falling and the subsidies can jump-start demand to help further bring down costs. They're inappropriate for mature industries, like nuclear power, where market forces should be allowed to do their work. 
Cost isn't the only reason an expansion of nuclear power is a bad idea. 
The safety of nuclear plants has certainly improved, thanks to changes adopted in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident. But safety problems persist, because the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission isn't adequately enforcing existing safety standards. What's more, countries where nuclear power is likely to expand don't have a strong system for regulating nuclear safety. 
The important thing to remember about safety is this: The entire nuclear power industry is vulnerable to the safety standards of its worst performers, because an accident anywhere in the world would stoke another antinuclear backlash among the public and investors. 
There's also the question of waste disposal. Proponents of nuclear power say disposal of the industry's waste products is a political problem. That's true. But it doesn't make the problem any less real. California, for instance, won't allow construction of more plants until the waste issue is resolved. 
Opposition to a long-term waste repository at Yucca Mountain shows how difficult it will be to come up with a politically acceptable solution. Yucca Mountain has been plagued by questions about the selection process and its suitability as a repository, and even if it is ultimately approved, it won't be available for at least another decade -- and it will be filled to capacity almost immediately. If it isn't approved, any replacement site will face the same opposition from neighbors and local political leaders. 
By far the greatest risk is the possibility that an expansion of nuclear power will contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Plants that enrich uranium for power plants can also be used to enrich for bombs; this is the path Iran is suspected of taking in developing a weapons program. An ambitious expansion of nuclear power would require a lot more facilities for enriching uranium, broadening this risk. Facilities for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel for reuse pose the danger that the material can be diverted for weapons. 
Expansion of nuclear power in the U.S. doesn't pose a great proliferation risk, but a nuclear renaissance will put a strain on the current anti-proliferation system. Most of the growth world-wide is expected to be in countries -- such as those in the Middle East and Africa -- where a nuclear-energy program could give cover to surreptitious weapons development and create the local expertise in handling and processing nuclear materials. 
The dangers of nuclear proliferation would be heightened if a nuclear revival turned to reprocessing of spent fuel to reduce the amount of high-level waste that builds up and to maintain adequate fuel supplies. Reprocessing is a problem because it can produce separated plutonium -- which is easier to steal or divert for weapons production, as North Korea has done, than plutonium contained in highly radioactive fuel. And commercial reprocessing plants produce so much plutonium that keeping track of it all is difficult, making it easier to divert enough for weapons without the loss being detected. 
If nuclear power really were able to make a big dent in greenhouse emissions, then it would be worth the time and resources necessary to address all these problems. Instead, though, the magnitude of these difficulties will keep any nuclear renaissance too small to make a difference, and will require expensive government support just to achieve modest gains. Those resources are better spent elsewhere.

The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here. 
Half a year after missing a deadline to come clean on its atomic activities, North Korea today submitted a declaration about its nuclear programs to Chinese officials in Beijing. Minutes later, the White House said the Bush administration will begin removing some sanctions against North Korea in response. 
South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan said the North was also preparing to blow up the cooling tower at the Yongbyon plant, which has been producing weapons-grade plutonium, a move that would in theory follow the country's removal from the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. Still, it wasn't immediately clear what information the documents include, and Pyongyang has in the past failed to fully comply with other steps outlined by a six-party agreement aimed at eliminating its nuclear-weapons program. 
Earlier today, during a trip to Japan, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said any American response to the declaration would rely on verification of the North Korean documents. "Obviously, the weapons and all the programs are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearization and it's going to have to be done so verifiably," Ms. Rice said. The Bush administration has been under fire from its usual allies on the American right for making the deal with North Korea, and in today's Wall Street Journal, Ms. Rice sought to defend the moves that would come today. "It may be the case that North Korea does not want to give up its nuclear weapons and programs. That is a real possibility," she writes. "But we should test it, and the best way to do that is through the six-party framework. Is it right to proceed cautiously? Absolutely. But in the final calculation, do we think our current policy is better than the alternatives? Yes, we do." 
Owning Up To Inflation 
The Federal Reserve neither raised nor lowered the cost of borrowed money for the first time since August of last year, just before the worsening credit crunch, financial-market tumult and economic anxiety prompted a skein of interest-rate cuts that totaled 3.25 percentage points over eight months. 
In keeping the benchmark federal funds rate at 2%, the Fed yesterday confirmed the message Ben Bernanke and other central bank officials have been spelling out in individual speeches: Inflation fears and the threat of self-fulfilling inflation expectations now outweigh concerns about economic growth. "Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending," the Federal Open Market Committee said. That contrasts with its April 30 depiction of weak economic activity and subdued consumer spending -- the biggest driver of the U.S. economy. 
The Fed said it still worries about the tight credit markets and still-softening job markets. But if the downside risks to economic growth "appear to have diminished somewhat," the increasing upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations -- businesses and workers seeking higher prices because they expect higher costs -- now have FOMC members skittish. While the committee still "expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year . . . in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high." Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who voted against several rate cuts and wanted the Fed to stand pat in April, dissented again yesterday and this time wanted to increase rates. 
The interest-rate decision and essential thrust of the new message were anticipated, and Mr. Fisher wasn't the only person to find the Fed's inflation stance wanting. The dollar declined against the euro once more, as The Wall Street Journal reports. Hours before the Fed met, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet essentially confirmed there will be an interest-rate increase there next month and took a more anxious tone about inflation expectations and the threat of "an inflationary wage-price spiral" in the euro zone. And the weakening dollar, as Fed Chairman Bernanke pointed out earlier this month, is a key source of inflation-expectation worries for the U.S. 
Even as they rapidly cut rates and took other measures to deal with the slowing economy and credit crunch earlier this year, Fed officials acknowledged it takes time to see how much lower borrowing costs are helping the economy, making it difficult to know when to stop. As they keep an eye on inflation expectations ahead of their next meeting in August, they might not be able to afford as much patience in deciding whether to go the other way. 
Punitive Damages and Capital Punishment 
In two rulings with emotional resonance, the Supreme Court yesterday slashed the punitive damages awarded against Exxon Mobile for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and declared imposition of the death penalty for child rape to be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. 
Five years after the dumping of 258,000 barrels of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound -- one of the worst ecological disasters in American history -- more than 32,000 fishermen and other parties sued the oil company. The jury awarded them what would eventually become $507.5 million in actual damages paid to the plaintiffs, and $5 billion in punitive damages, an amount an appellate court eventually lowered to $2.5 billion. A 5-3 majority yesterday said the punitive award shouldn't have exceeded the actual damages, as The Wall Street Journal notes. In what the Journal calls a discourse on the history of punitive damages, Justice David Souter said such blockbuster awards introduce a degree of "stark unpredictability" that could make punitive damages unjust. And though the full implications of the ruling aren't clear, it was cheered by business groups. 
The plaintiffs, who each received an average of $15,000 in actual damages, will now get a similar amount in punitive damages, the New York Times says. The paper notes that in his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said he would have upheld the already reduced punitive amount decided by the federal appeals court. "In light of Exxon's decision to permit a lapsed alcoholic to command a supertanker carrying tens of millions of gallons of crude oil though the treacherous waters of Prince William Sound, thereby endangering all of the individuals who depended upon the sound for their livelihoods," he wrote, "the jury could reasonably have given expression to its moral condemnation of Exxon's conduct in the form of this award." 
In the court's 5-4 decision in the death-penalty case, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority that there is "a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons," even when the crime is as "devastating" as the rape of a child. It was, as the Times notes, the third decision in six years "to place a categorical limitation on capital punishment" -- following prohibitions on the death penalty for mentally retarded defendants or people convicted of crimes committed before they were 18 years old. The death penalty has played a poignant role in presidential politics for decades, and both Barack Obama and John McCain were quick to assail yesterday's ruling, each placing the rape of a child among the most "heinous" of crimes, and one for which capital punishment shouldn't be excluded. 
Also of Note. . . 
New York Times: The bodies of 28 members of a Pakistani government- sponsored peace committee were found dumped on a road near the tribal area of South Waziristan, and the Pakistani Taliban said the men were killed because they supported the government, according to a Taliban statement made to a local journalist. The killings appeared to be a direct challenge to the policy of the new Pakistani government to negotiate with militants rather than use military force. Separately, the Afghan government for the first time publicly accused the Pakistani intelligence service of organizing the failed plot to assassinate President Hamid Karzai at a parade in Kabul in April. 
Newsweek: A Bush administration program to expand domestic use of Pentagon spy satellites has aroused new concerns in Congress about possible civil-liberties abuses. This week, the House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment denying money for the new domestic intelligence operation -- cryptically named the "National Applications Office" -- until the Homeland Security secretary certifies that any programs undertaken by the center will "comply with all existing laws, including all applicable privacy and civil liberties standards." 
Washington Post: Just a month ago, Republican strategists were trying to closely link Democratic House candidates to Sen. Barack Obama, convinced that in certain parts of the country Mr. Obama would drag candidates from his own party down to defeat. But this week, a Republican senator, Gordon Smith of Oregon, offered a much different assessment of Mr. Obama's coattail effect: He included words of praise from Obama as part of an ad promoting his own reelection. 
Los Angeles Times: California air regulators announced a bold plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions that would alter the way utilities generate electricity, automakers build cars and developers construct buildings, and launch the broadest U.S. market in carbon-credit trading. Virtually every sector of the state's economy would be affected by the air board's plan, including coal-fired power plants and oil refineries, landfills where rotting garbage emits methane gas and forests, which would be cultivated to reduce fires. But the California Air Resources Board's draft road map for implementing the state's landmark 2006 global warming law faces daunting obstacles, among them resistance from the Bush administration. 
Wall Street Journal: Anheuser-Busch is prepared to reject InBev's unsolicited $46.35 billion acquisition offer as early as this week, setting the stage for a hostile takeover battle for America's largest brewer, according to people familiar with the matter. Anheuser is expected to argue that InBev's offer undervalues the maker of Budweiser beer and soon present its own strategic plan, but ultimately, the move isn't likely to deter InBev. 
New York Post: Dick Grasso won a major victory yesterday in the four-year legal battle over his $190 million pay package, setting the stage for the former New York Stock Exchange boss to enter into settlement discussions with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. 
Financial Times: UBS has hired Lazard as the external adviser to help with its strategic review, signaling that the troubled Swiss bank may be considering more radical steps than originally expected. Lazard's role is primarily to identify an appropriate business model in investment banking, according to people familiar with the review process. 
National Geographic: An ancient Dane with Arabian genes is part of a DNA study that suggests Scandinavians of 2,000 years ago were more genetically diverse than today. Researchers say the Iron Age man may have been a soldier serving on the Roman Empire's northern frontier or a descendant of female slaves transported from the Middle East. 
Quote of the Day 
"Especially in an election year, very few things are actually going to make it into law and going to be signed by the president. The housing bill has a great chance of being signed into law. And that's why we're trying to get this renewable tax credit on this piece of legislation," Republican Sen. John Ensign said yesterday, in explaining why he has blocked Senate passage of an ambitious plan to help troubled borrowers save their homes until the majority Democrats agree to add to the bill tax breaks to encourage the production of renewable energy, as the Washington Post reports. Though Mr. Ensign's home state of Nevada has the highest foreclosure rate in the U.S., his demand has stalled a massive housing package with broad bipartisan support at a time when home sales continue to tumble. Democrats object to adding the energy provisions to the House version of the bill because they aren't accompanied by tax increases to pay for them -- and a majority of House Democrats have pledged to reject any measure increasing the budget deficit.

Abstract 
Among the likely fights: municipal electric utilities in the state, which get much of their electricity from relatively high-polluting coal-fired plants outside the state, could be hit harder than investor-owned utilities, which get much of their power from less- polluting sources such as natural gas and hydroelectric dams. 

Full text 
California regulators are proposing a slate of rules to limit the state's global-warming emissions, setting off a fight among companies and consumers about who will pay the brunt of the bill. 
California's pollution-control agency is scheduled Thursday to flesh out how the state proposes to deliver on an ambitious 2006 law pledging to cut the state's greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The plan includes a "cap-and-trade" system, under which the state would give industry a set number of permits for emissions. If a company needed more permits than it received, it would have to buy extra permits from companies with an excess. 
The California plan comes less than a month after Congress rejected a cap-and-trade emissions plan. That proposal failed amid concerns that it would add to rising energy prices. 
Both presidential candidates have expressed support for a cap-and- trade program, and Congress is expected to resume debate on the issue next year. 
The California plan, which is likely to be debated for about two years before regulations are set, will face the same concerns. Details of the plan have yet to be decided, but the proposal makes clear that the costs will affect everyone in the state. Among the measures being considered: Fees on greenhouse-gas emissions that could raise the wholesale price of gasoline by between 10 cents and 50 cents a gallon. 
State officials said they were studying how much the plan would cost. They said by inducing energy efficiency and the development of alternatives to oil and coal, the savings from the program "will, on the whole, outweigh the costs." They estimate the plan would expand the California economy about 1% beyond the level it otherwise would be in 2020. Beyond that, they expect the emission-cutting plan would spur further growth in California in businesses that develop cleaner technologies. 
The plan would cap emissions from the sources responsible for 85% of greenhouse-gas output in the state -- a level similar to the one proposed by the federal bill that Congress rejected. It would fall hardest on the transportation and electricity sectors, since together they account for about two-thirds of all greenhouse-gas emissions in California. 
The plan marks a political risk for California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Republican has staked out a national reputation for environmental aggressiveness. It was his 2005 executive order that led to the California law promising a big emissions cut, and he has frequently criticized what he calls insufficient action by the White House to curb emissions. 
Yet California's attempts to implement some of its environmental promises under Gov. Schwarzenegger have sparked industry ire, in some cases prompting the governor to soften his stance. California's plan is likely to begin a lobbying battle as companies jockey to shape the rules to obtain as many pollution permits as possible. 
Among the likely fights: municipal electric utilities in the state, which get much of their electricity from relatively high-polluting coal-fired plants outside the state, could be hit harder than investor-owned utilities, which get much of their power from less- polluting sources such as natural gas and hydroelectric dams. 
State officials said they have designed their plan to mitigate those inequities. 
California industry is split on the plan. Groups representing Silicon Valley technology companies expressed support, calling the plan a way to increase clean-technology investment. Groups representing energy companies raised concerns. "If they don't do this right, the cost to California consumers from an energy standpoint is going to be substantial," said Cathy Reheis-Boyd, chief operating officer for the Western States Petroleum Association, a Sacramento, Calif., group that represents the oil industry. 
As an alternative to a cap-and-trade program, which would indirectly make energy more expensive, state officials are considering levying direct "carbon fees." Those fees "would need to be sufficiently high to change behavior over time," the state's proposal says. 
To further discourage burning gasoline, the state is considering such moves as levying fees on motorists who use certain roads at peak- traffic times and regulations pegging auto-insurance premiums to the number of miles someone drives.

Abstract 
On Tuesday, in a move to restore the Everglades wetlands, he announced Florida would pay $1.75 billion to purchase roughly 300 square miles of land currently used for sugar production from U.S. Sugar Corp. The deal, which officials say will cover a land area the size of New York City, would effectively shut down America's largest sugar grower and allow Florida to better connect its Lake Okeechobee with the so- called River of Grass, the swampy waterway that carries overflow from the lake to its natural runoff in the ocean. 

Full Text 
MIAMI -- In the space of a week, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist cheered the oil industry by suggesting he could live with oil wells off the Florida coast, then won praise from Greens for cutting a deal to reclaim 300 square miles of the Everglades from sugar farming. 
As high fuel prices force partisans on all sides of the long-running U.S. oil-vs.-environment debate to rethink their political calculations, Gov. Crist is emerging as a high-profile pioneer of a potential third way: being pro-alternative energy and conservation but also open to more oil exploration, provided it is done with care for the oceans and beaches. 
That Mr. Crist is governor of a critical presidential-election swing state and a potential contender for the Republican vice-presidential slot makes his recent moves all the more notable. 
Mr. Crist -- a 51-year-old attorney by training -- belongs to a group of Republican governors who tend to take conservative positions on many issues while working across party lines on environmental matters. 
Since taking office last year, he has put solar panels on the roof of the governor's mansion and pushed state regulators to give priority to renewable energy and conservation programs before approving new coal-fired power plants. 
He also continues to defend his green bona fides. In Miami Wednesday, he opened a climate-change summit featuring diplomats from around the world. 
On Tuesday, in a move to restore the Everglades wetlands, he announced Florida would pay $1.75 billion to purchase roughly 300 square miles of land currently used for sugar production from U.S. Sugar Corp. 
The deal, which officials say will cover a land area the size of New York City, would effectively shut down America's largest sugar grower and allow Florida to better connect its Lake Okeechobee with the so- called River of Grass, the swampy waterway that carries overflow from the lake to its natural runoff in the ocean. 
Mr. Crist cited the deal with U.S. Sugar in an interview Wednesday as his proudest environmental accomplishment. "The enormity of it is hard to comprehend. We're talking about a tract of land that's almost 300 square miles, which if done right . . . will restore the natural flow of the river of grass," he says. "It's honoring God's work. It's really restoring the natural filter of that amazing estuary. That's pretty dramatic stuff." 
Mr. Crist's shift on drilling has been more controversial, in part because it illustrates how concerns about environmental protection are taking a back seat to fears about the economy. 
While environmentalists continue to give Mr. Crist high marks on many issues, they say his shift has put the 27-year-old congressional moratorium on drilling in federal waters in grave political danger. The moratorium puts most of the nation's outer continental shelf off limits to energy exploration, with the exception of some waters off Alaska and every Gulf Coast state but Florida. 
"If the governor of Iowa were to say this, it wouldn't change the politics much," says Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope. 
Mr. Crist says he will support drilling off Florida's coast only if it can be done "far enough, safe enough, and clean enough" for the state's residents and beaches. Allowing drilling off Florida's shores, he adds, is "the last thing I'd like to do. It doesn't mean you don't do the last thing you'd like to do." Though a 2007 analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded that opening up drilling in the moratorium area "would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030," Mr.Crist says "the mere conversation" about loosening the policy "affects speculators potentially and the marketplace." 
Mr. Crist's critics accuse him of supporting a proposal that would accelerate climate change by encouraging dirty fuels. His response: "We're in an energy crisis now . . . . You have to look at trying to help the American family . . . and try to get more domestic production in a responsible, safe, clean way, but at the same time realize that the long-term goal is alternative fuels, renewables." 
As the November contest with Democrat Sen. Barack Obama approaches, Mr. Crist is increasingly trying to help Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, clinch Florida's 27 electoral votes. 
That task has sometimes revealed big differences between the two on issues important to Floridians. Mr. McCain, for example, opposed legislation in Congress last year that funded Everglades restoration, as well as a proposal to create a national catastrophic-insurance fund for hurricane-prone states like Florida. Mr. Crist supports both proposals. 
Mr. McCain has said he would bring industry and government together to protect homeowners, and while voicing support for Everglades restoration, has said he voted against the legislation funding it because it also contained hundreds of other projects that he considered wasteful. 
"The notion that you would agree on everything . . . is naive," Mr. Crist says. "But that you agree on enough things and you have enough trust and confidence in a public servant like John McCain, I think that's enough for him to win Florida." 
Democrats accuse Mr. Crist of pandering to Sen. McCain, who publicly endorsed lifting the ban only a day before Mr. Crist. Mr. Crist says that the charge is "simply not true" and that he was "just being honest" when he told journalists last week that his view on the matter had changed. 
"When you hit $4-a-gallon [gasoline], any public servant worth their salt needs to realize that's a significant drain on the economy . . . . You can say I'm never going to change my mind, and be consistent your entire life. You can also be wrong over and over if you don't take into account change," he says. 
Asked whether he has any interest in being Mr. McCain's running mate, Mr. Crist says, "I really don't -- I can't believe I'm governor of Florida." But when pressed, he won't categorically rule out accepting such an offer, either. "He hasn't asked," Mr. Crist says. "So it's a moot question."

Abstract 
In general, the Republican presidential candidate has been reluctant to support mandates, tax credits and subsidies aimed at boosting alternative fuels, saying that government interference distorts the market. 

Full Text 
Sen. John McCain is putting energy policy at the center of his presidential campaign, embracing a diverse array of positions that defies easy categorization. 
He is for more oil drilling and also for alternatives to oil. He wants to drill off the coasts but not in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He supports subsidies for nuclear power and clean-coal technology, but has opposed them for ethanol, solar and wind power. 
He wants to lower gasoline prices by temporarily suspending the federal gas tax. But he wants to raise the price of gas with a cap- and-trade system that punishes polluting industries. 
In environmentally conscious Portland, Ore., he praised wind power. In Texas oil country he supported more drilling. In rural Missouri he urged more nuclear power. In California he praised fuel-efficiency standards. 
"It's all over the map," said Bob Ebel, a senior adviser and energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I'm just sort of scratching my head." 
In general, the Republican presidential candidate has been reluctant to support mandates, tax credits and subsidies aimed at boosting alternative fuels, saying that government interference distorts the market. 
He opposes subsides for ethanol, famously declining to back down even as he competed for votes in the corn state of Iowa. He has opposed federal tax credits for wind and solar power, but his campaign said last week it would support a new credit aimed at these industries. 
Just last month, he explained why they were a bad idea. Asked in Washington state about subsidies to promote solar power, he said: "When government jumps in and distorts the market, then there's unintended consequences as well as intended." 
Sen. McCain has long supported subsidies for nuclear power, proposing a new commitment to construct 45 new reactors by 2030. He also proposed $2 billion a year in subsidies for clean coal, despite numerous technical problems bringing this technology to market. 
Given his opposition to government interference, Sen. McCain was asked last week why he supports government help for nuclear and clean- coal industries. "We know clean coal is a winner and we need to spend money on nuclear reactors to get that process moving," he told reporters. 
Sen. McCain was an early supporter of a cap-and-trade system to control carbon emissions and slow global warming. Under this system, those who pollute too much would have to buy credits from those that bring their emissions down. 
But when cap-and-trade legislation finally cleared a Senate committee and made it to the Senate floor, he said he would oppose the bill. First he said it didn't contain enough support for nuclear power. Later, an adviser said it contained too much extraneous spending. The bill never came up for a final vote. 
With gasoline prices at record highs, Sen. McCain makes it clear on almost a daily basis that he knows American families are struggling. U.S. reliance on foreign oil, he says, threatens U.S. security as well as its economy. 
"Energy security is the great national challenge of our time," he said Monday in Fresno, Calif., where he came out for new incentives toward battery-operated cars. He said that punishments should be increased for car companies that fail to meet fuel-efficiency standards -- typically luxury car makers who represent a small slice of the market. But Sen. McCain has opposed raising those standards in the past. 
Sen. Barack Obama's campaign jumped on this point. 
"We just don't have the ability as a nation to predict whether President McCain would be the president who's for more tax cuts for big oil . . . or whether he would wake up one morning and decide it was time to come back to the discussion about fuel-economy standards," said senior energy adviser Jason Grumet. 
Last week, Sen. McCain reversed himself and said he would support lifting a federal ban on offshore oil drilling. But he has taken considerable flak from some conservatives over his opposition to drilling in ANWR. At a town hall meeting and a fund-raiser last week, he was confronted by supporters of Arctic drilling, one of whom said he had information that would change Sen. McCain's mind. 
Later, on his bus, Sen. McCain said he had changed his position on offshore oil drilling because of the rising price of oil. Asked if the high price of oil tempts him to reconsider drilling in ANWR, as well, he said: "No, but again, if somebody says, 'Will you look at this information?'. . . I'll be glad to look at that information. I think it's incumbent on me to review it. But I certainly haven't changed my position."

McCain's Energy Drill

Abstract 
In the past, the Republican has been a chief opponent of opening up the vast U.S. offshore regions and other federal lands where oil-and-gas exploration and production are prohibited, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 

Full Text 
Behold, a miracle: Public anger over $4 gas is forcing at least some of our political class to confront their energy contradictions. Last week, Republicans Jim Walsh of New York and Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland -- two longstanding opponents of offshore drilling -- asked for a mulligan. We can now add John McCain to the roll: In a speech in Houston yesterday, the Senator finally came out in favor of increasing domestic energy supplies. 
This is progress, even if it did come dressed in some of Mr. McCain's familiar policy confusions. In the past, the Republican has been a chief opponent of opening up the vast 
U.S. offshore regions and other federal lands where oil-and-gas exploration and production are prohibited, especially the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But oil at $135 a barrel is a powerful political motivator. 
The candidate now says we must drill for more domestic oil "as a matter of fairness to the American people." He did not back off from his sentimentality about ANWR -- leaving off-limits nearly half of the proven reserves of the entire U.S. at 10.4 billion barrels. But he did propose to open most of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to development, so long as the nearby states were in favor. This could open up as much as 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 86 billion barrels of oil on the Outer Continental Shelf to development. That's a big deal considering that we now consume nearly 10 billion barrels a year. 
Mr. McCain also picked up on a good idea from the Bush years, in which states would share the royalties generated by offshore development. In 2006, Congress lifted prohibitions on leasing a narrow strip in the Gulf of Mexico, splitting 37.5% of oil-industry returns with Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama. By filling state treasuries, this arrangement could build political constituencies for increased domestic production, and is attracting interest among the Southern seaboard states. 
In 2007, at the urging of Democratic Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and the legislature, the Interior Department tried to open deepwater areas off the state to seismic testing. Yet Congress has so far refused to appropriate funds for even this preliminary step. Democratic leaders and the green lobby remain opposed to any exploration whatsoever, no matter how minimal the environmental disturbance from modern equipment. 
This obstructionism may now be tested. We hear -- and hope -- that as early as this week President Bush may lift a 1990 executive order that prohibits offshore drilling. That would leave Congress as the only obstacle to drilling policies that would help alleviate record- high gas prices. Since those prices are hurting the GOP politically almost as much as they're hurting consumers economically, Mr. McCain's drilling reversal sets him up for a useful debate with Barack Obama. 
For a candidate claiming the mantle of "change," Mr. Obama's energy policy might as well have been drafted in the 1970s. He supports punitive new windfall profits taxes on Big Oil, which won't do anything for supply; as well as at least $10 billion a year in new subsidies for "alternative" energy technologies, which may take years or decades to pan out, if they ever do. 
Mr. Obama's hostility to new drilling relates directly to his larger hostility to all carbon energy. Last week, he told a CNBC interviewer that his only objection to higher energy prices was how fast they had risen. He said, "I think that I would have preferred a gradual adjustment." His climate-change tax-and-regulation scheme known as cap and trade is designed to raise gasoline and other energy prices, albeit in a politically stealthy fashion. 
Mr. McCain would have an easier time making a contrast with Mr. Obama if he didn't also support a softer version of cap and trade himself, on top of all his other green genuflections. He also needs to get his bearings on the reason oil prices are high. It's not merely rising demand from China and India, and it certainly isn't because "some people on Wall Street" are speculating in the futures market, as Mr. McCain claimed yesterday. 
Mr. McCain seems to lack a basic understanding of how markets work and so is often swayed by such populist nostrums. He would have been better off mentioning the Federal Reserve and Bush Administration's weak dollar policy, which has sent all commodity prices soaring across the board since last August. By rightly blaming inflation, he would also have put himself on the side of the middle class the way Ronald Reagan did in the 1970s. That's a wiser kind of populism. 
No matter how far the country progresses in "the great turn away from carbon-emitting fuels," as Mr. McCain put it, the truth is that fossil fuels will remain indispensable for decades. The U.S. Energy Information Agency forecasts that over the next 25 years, oil, coal and natural gas will provide roughly the same 86% of the world's energy mix as they do today. Mr. McCain's new willingness to drill is at least a welcome bow to that reality.

Abstract 
Democrats have tended to support restrictions on access to sensitive lands and focused on other ways to drive down prices: reining in speculators; punishing the OPEC oil cartel; and funding research on alternative-energy sources, possibly via a windfall-profits tax on oil companies. "Why should we expect oil-and-gas companies to rush into new areas to begin production when they are sitting on literally millions and millions of acres of existing leases without doing any production on those?" Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said in a speech last month. 

Full text 
The oil industry is turning up the heat on Congress to open up more federal land to oil and natural-gas drilling, arguing that will do more to cut energy prices than new taxes on industry profits. But environmentalists and Congressional Democrats opposed to that tack are firing back with a new challenge: Drill what you have. 
For years, political and environmental obstacles have limited the oil industry's access to large swaths of U.S. territory, most notably the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska. 
Democrats have tended to support restrictions on access to sensitive lands and focused on other ways to drive down prices: reining in speculators; punishing the OPEC oil cartel; and funding research on alternative-energy sources, possibly via a windfall-profits tax on oil companies. 
Industry backers, including many Republicans, say the answer to high prices is increased supply and that the way to do that is to drill in areas now off-limits. 
Now, voter anger over soaring gasoline prices is shoving this perennial dispute to the top of Washington's energy agenda. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude for July delivery fell $1.88 Friday to settle at $134.86, near its all-time high. Last Monday, the average retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded was $4.039, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
A recent Gallup poll shows 57% of Americans support opening up new territories to drilling, while a Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll conducted this month shows 59% of Americans saying Congress should take the lead on responding to high gas prices. 
Although high prices are giving the oil industry a new opportunity to make its case for greater access to domestic petroleum, the industry's allies in the Democratic-controlled Congress have so far had little success. Last week, a House panel voted against lifting a decades-old ban on drilling in the outer continental shelf. 
Complicating matters, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has broken with many members of his party, including President Bush, in saying he would oppose drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has indicated he would defer to the wishes of coastal states on drilling in the outer continental shelf. 
Democrats are looking to shift the terms of the debate by arguing it is possible to increase domestic oil production without opening up new lands. The government, they point out, has leased some 91.5 million acres of land and waters for drilling, but federal data show only about a quarter of that is producing oil and gas. Moreover, the portion is shrinking; about 27% of the onshore acres were producing oil and gas in 2007, down from an average of 30.5% in production over the preceding decade. 
The industry and its backers say such arguments reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the oil industry. Companies don't know how much oil is under the lands they lease, so they buy up large swaths in the hope that a fraction will work out. Much of the area that isn't producing, they say, doesn't have oil or gas in commercially viable quantities. 
Moreover, bringing a new field into production can require years of mapping, testing, drilling and construction -- during which time the land would show up in statistics as being "not in production," even as companies spend millions or even billions of dollars to bring it online. 
"I guarantee you, anybody who's got a commercial discovery today in the United States has got it under development. They'd be silly not to at these prices," Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said in an interview. 
Such explanations aren't winning over skeptical Democrats on Capitol Hill. "Why should we expect oil-and-gas companies to rush into new areas to begin production when they are sitting on literally millions and millions of acres of existing leases without doing any production on those?" Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said in a speech last month. 
Mr. Bingaman added in an interview, "If there have been a lot of leases let that are not produceable, that's information we need to have to determine whether we should renew those leases. There's no reason to renew leases if they're not produceable." 
Some lawmakers are mulling ways to change the industry's incentives. Wall Street increasingly values oil companies -- especially the smaller ones that dominate onshore U.S. production -- based on their reserves, not just their production. That gives companies an incentive to snap up land even if they won't be able to drill it for years. 
On Thursday, House Democrats introduced legislation that seeks to compel energy companies to either produce or give up the federal onshore and offshore leases they are holding, by barring them from obtaining any more leases unless they can demonstrate that they are producing oil and gas, or are "diligently developing" the leases they hold. 
Currently, companies must give up nonproducing leases after a set period of time -- usually five or 10 years -- but they can often get extensions, and there is no limit on the 
number of leases a company can hold at a given time. 
The bill is modeled on a 1976 law that attempted to discourage speculation on federal coal as a result of the energy crises of the 1970s. 
"If they're bidding on these leases, we're assuming they're bidding on them because they believe there's a high-percentage likelihood that there is oil there. And if they don't, then they should not have bid on them," says Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. 
Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, called Mr. Markey's remarks, "naive." 
"They call the first step in the oil business 'exploration.' If every bit of land had oil and gas, you wouldn't need to explore," he said. 
High prices have driven new interest in fields that weren't economical when oil was selling for less than $60 a barrel three years ago. If prices stay high, Mr. Cavaney said, the percentage of leased land in production will rise. 
Even if the lands are opened to drilling, however, most experts don't expect immediate relief from high prices. The more-accessible reserves off the coasts of California and Florida would take several years to bring into production, and the remote Arctic refuge would take a decade or more. Even once those fields did come online, their impact on prices would likely be limited. The largest field in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is believed to contain about 1.4 billion barrels of oil -- roughly half what Saudi Arabia exports in a single year. 
As oil prices have hit records, proponents of drilling in new areas have increased pressure on Congress. A group led by the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday that its "Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less" petition drive had netted half a million signatures. 
Industry supporters say they can't be sure how much oil exists in areas they haven't explored. But they say there are good reasons to think large reserves exist in areas now closed to drilling. Closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of California, for example, abut areas that have been drilled successfully for years. 
The industry also complains that efforts to produce on leased land are sometimes slowed by environmental groups. In the West Tavaputs field in Northeastern Utah, Denver-based Bill Barrett Corp. is producing natural gas on only 30% of the more than 40,000 acres of federal land it owns the rights to there. The company says its progress has been stymied by legal challenges from environmental groups. 
Steve Bloch, an attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, says his group and others have been trying to slow drilling in the area but they have often been unsuccessful. State-wide, he adds, his group has objected to only a small fraction of drilling-permit applications.

Abstract 
[...] while Sen. McCain says he favors an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, his voting record shows a reluctance to support mandates, tax credits and other policies often touted by other politicians, including Sen. Obama, as ways to spur greater use of alternative energies and energy efficiency. At a roundtable with business leaders in Washington state last month, Sen. McCain expressed reluctance to support government incentives such as tax credits for wind and solar energy. 

Full text 
Arizona Republican John McCain and Illinois Democrat Barack Obama say a lot of the same things about energy and environmental policy: Both want to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil and fight global warming. Both want binding caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. Both see a stepped-up role for nuclear power. 
So does that mean that America will get the same energy strategy no matter which candidate wins? Not by a long shot. 
Sen. McCain's and Sen. Obama's goals may sound similar, but the candidates would pursue drastically different paths to achieve them. Those differences are coming into sharper focus, with the end of the contentious Democratic nomination battle and the surge in oil prices, which on Friday shot up nearly $11 a barrel. 
Sen. Obama is pushing a bigger government role in fostering the development of technologies to reduce emissions and alternatives to fossil fuels. Sen. McCain, meanwhile, argues for a more hands-off approach, saying "unintended consequences" can result from wrongheaded interference in the marketplace. 
For example, while Sen. McCain says he favors an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, his voting record shows a reluctance to support mandates, tax credits and other policies often touted by other politicians, including Sen. Obama, as ways to spur greater use of alternative energies and energy efficiency. 
Sen. McCain argues that many of the steps are little more than subsidies that enrich special interests. He has long called for scrapping the federal ethanol tax credit, saying America's corn- ethanol industry can and should stand on its own. He has also voted against requiring electric utilities to boost their use of renewable energy sources, preferring to let cities and states set their own targets for renewable energy. 
At a roundtable with business leaders in Washington state last month, Sen. McCain expressed reluctance to support government incentives such as tax credits for wind and solar energy. He compared his stance on the matter to his position on corn ethanol. "I'm a little wary -- I have to give you straight talk -- about government subsidies," he said. "When government jumps in and distorts the market, then there's unintended consequences as well as intended." 
Sen. Obama has no such compunction about using the government's means to achieve his ends on energy and climate change. He says the U.S. doesn't do enough to move promising but risky clean-energy technologies from the research lab to the marketplace. 
He's promising to invest $150 billion over the next decade in alternative fuels such as cellulosic ethanol that can be made from materials such as switchgrass and wood chips. He'd push a requirement that the U.S. by 2025 get at least 25% of its electricity from renewable sources like the wind, the sun and geothermal energy (which together currently account for less than 1% of U.S. electricity supply). 
Sen. Obama is also framing the climate-change debate in more explicit language than Sen. McCain. "We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on, you know, 72 degrees [Fahrenheit] at all times and then just expect that every other country's going to say OK. That's not -- that's not leadership," he told a crowd in Portland, Oregon, last month. 
Both candidates' positions have their share of inconsistencies and hedges. Last year, Sen. Obama, whose home state of Illinois is a big coal producer, co-sponsored legislation that would subsidize facilities that make liquid fuel from coal, even though the Environmental Protection Agency has found liquid coal contains twice the global-warming pollution of conventional gasoline, when all of its emissions -- from production through development and consumption -- are measured. After environmentalists protested, Sen. Obama said he'd support subsidies for the technology only if the resulting fuel emitted 20% less carbon dioxide than conventional fuels. 
On nuclear power, Sen. Obama says he's open to expanding nuclear energy, which now provides 20% of the nation's electricity, as part of an effort to increase power sources that emit little or no carbon dioxide. But he also has said there is no future for expanded nuclear energy until the U.S. comes up with a safe, long-term solution for disposing of nuclear waste. He opposes the Bush administration's plan for storing waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
Sen. McCain has expressed support for the Yucca Mountain proposal. And while he opposes subsidies for many alternative-energy technologies, he wants bigger incentives for nuclear energy, arguing that the U.S. "will not succeed in achieving independence [from] foreign oil nor . . . in addressing seriously the issue of greenhouse- gas emissions" without expanding its use of nuclear power. Many environmentalists see his stance as inconsistent with his free-market rhetoric. 
Sen. McCain's goals in reducing emissions are more modest than Sen. Obama's. He seeks a 60% reduction from 1990 levels by the middle of the century, compared with Sen. Obama's more aggressive 80% reduction, which is backed by many scientists. Sen. McCain also supports a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax, a move that Sen. Obama opposes and that even some conservative supporters say would encourage motorists to drive more and use more fuel. 
With prices at the pump rising, Congress is under pressure to take action. This week, the Senate takes up legislation that would allow the Justice Department to sue members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries under U.S. antitrust laws. A spokesman for Sen. Obama says he supports the measure, while Sen. McCain's spokesman says the senator hasn't taken a position.

Abstract 
It was going to be the historic turning point in U.S. climate change policy. 

Full Text 
For months, Democrats and the environmental lobby promoted last week's Senate global-warming debate as a political watershed. It was going to be the historic turning point in U.S. climate change policy. In the event, their bill collapsed in a little more than three days. 
Democrats failed to secure a majority, much less the 60 Senators necessary, for a procedural vote on Friday morning that would have allowed the real work of amending the bill to begin. By that point, Majority Leader Harry Reid had already made it plain that he wanted the bill off the floor as quickly as possible -- despite calling climate change "the most critical issue of our time." But not critical enough, apparently, even to let his Members vote on the merits, much less amendments. 
The strange death of this year's cap-and-trade movement was so unexpected that some are already predicting a shift in the politics of global warming. That's premature. Still, the postmortem holds lessons for the next time this issue emerges. 
Until last week, the Democratic M.O. on climate change was to lash the Bush Administration for its supposed inaction and then pass responsibility onto regulators and the courts. Proponents thought they had the whip hand. Yet this time they had to defend an actual piece of legislation -- and once it was subjected to even preliminary scrutiny, the Democrats crumpled faster than you can say $4 gas. 
Bad timing was the least of it. Republicans methodically dismantled the cost and complexity of "cap and trade," which sounds harmless but would inflict collateral damage on the wider economy in lost GDP and higher prices up and down the energy chain. Conveniently, the Democrats would also bestow unto Congress (read: themselves) some $6.7 trillion in new tax revenues and carbon welfare handouts over the next four decades. Some of the most effective opponents -- like freshman GOP Senator Bob Corker -- support climate regulation but view the current scheme as frivolous, dishonest or both. 
Their task was helped along by the incompetence of the Democrats, especially floor manager Barbara Boxer. Environmentalists deemed it blasphemy that anyone would oppose their grand ambitions, instead of trying to persuade. "I resent the Senator from Tennessee saying our bill is a slush fund," Ms. Boxer said at one point, apparently serious. 
After Mr. Corker called the bill "the mother of all earmarks" and "a huge unnecessary transference of wealth," Ms. Boxer was reduced to arguing that it's really "a huge tax cut for the American people" and "will not increase gas prices." These are delusions, or worse. Cap and trade is designed to raise energy prices, which are supposed to spur the investments and behavior changes needed for a less carbon- intensive economy. 
Such realities are beginning to seep into liberal precincts. After the bill bottomed out, no fewer than 10 Democrats from the Midwest and South -- whose economies rely on coal-fired power or heavy industry and thus will be disproportionately affected -- registered their displeasure with Mr. Reid and Ms. Boxer. Including Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Carl Levin (Michigan), Jay Rockefeller (West Virginia) and Jim Webb (Virginia), the Senators said they could not support cap and trade "in its current form" because it would cause "undue hardship on our states, key industrial sectors and consumers." 
Even Barack Obama and John McCain backed away from a bill they claim to favor. Mr. McCain said he opposed it because it didn't do enough for nuclear power, while Mr. Obama blamed the failure on Republicans. But the word on Capitol Hill is that both Presidential candidates urged Mr. Reid to yank the bill, lest they get trapped into voting for higher energy prices. 
Maybe a vast reordering of the American economy in the name of solving a speculative problem isn't as popular as the greens believe. And perhaps President Bush's approach to climate change -- voluntary reductions and subsidies for alternative technology -- will seem a lot more realistic once the partisan fevers of the moment have passed. 
That's not to say that cap and trade won't return in a more politically potent form next year. The greens will regroup and try to do a better job of buying off their adversaries, especially businesses that could profit from carbon regulation. Nonetheless, this past week has shown that the more transparent any cap and trade debate is, the less chance this tax and spend idea will become law.

Gas Prices Help Defeat Senate's Climate Bill

Full Text 
WASHINGTON -- Record high gasoline prices played into the hands of climate-change bill opponents Friday, as the Senate defeated a sweeping plan to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions and limit the effects of climate change. 
The 48-36 vote was 12 votes short of the number needed to bring debate to a close and vote on the bill. Democrats from oil and manufacturing states joined 32 Republicans to oppose going forward with the legislation sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer, (D., Calif.), Joseph Lieberman, (I., Conn.) and John Warner, (R., Va.). 
Some lawmakers who sided with Democratic leaders on the procedural vote have indicated that they might not support the climate-change bill. Sen. Evan Bayh (D., Ind.) and Sen. Ken Salazar (D., Colo.) are among those who followed party leaders but indicated they had concerns. 
Senate Democratic leaders will try to retake the offensive next week, when they plan to bring up for Senate debate a bill aimed at lowering gasoline prices . A Tuesday vote is scheduled on whether to proceed with legislation that would impose a tax on oil-company profits deemed to have been generated from extra-high prices, among other things. Democrats say this would lower gasoline prices, while Republicans favor increased drilling in off-limit areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Democratic leaders are looking ahead to the November elections, which they expect to strengthen their hand to deal with climate change. Presidential contenders Arizona Sen. John McCain and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, didn't show up to vote Friday, but both are on the record supporting emissions limits of the sort included in the climate-change bill. 
Enacting climate-change legislation this year had always been viewed as a long shot, but supporters had hoped to set the framework for action next year by establishing principles for compromise. 
Instead, Democratic leaders who had pushed the bill found themselves on the defensive as gasoline prices, hovering around a record $4 a gallon, played into the hands of Republican opponents who pointed out that the measure would raise energy costs. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other Republican leaders made high gasoline prices one of their main lines of attack, and then tied up the Senate floor -­preventing debate on other issues -- by forcing Senate clerks to spend all day Wednesday reading the bill. The tactics prompted Senate Democrats to cut short the amount of time devoted to debating, limiting chances to nail down areas of compromise. 
"If we'd have done two weeks, we'd have maybe passed a few amendments, adjusted a little more, gotten a couple of more votes," said Sen. John Kerry, one of the Democrats negotiating on the bill. 
Underscoring that point, Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan, broke with his colleagues to cast a "no" vote. To vote otherwise would have been to "obliterate the significant amendment that I'd offered," which aimed to provide $20 billion at the 2012 start of the emissions- reduction program for research and development of clean-coal technology, the North Dakota senator said in an interview. 
Under the bill, polluters would have to hold allowances for the right to spew emissions into the atmosphere, up to the limit permitted under law. Companies that had trouble staying within limits would have to buy additional allowances, while companies that found cheap ways to reduce emissions could sell excess allowances. The effect would be to penalize polluters and reward companies that found ways to operate with more energy efficiency. 
Some big industries lobbied hard against the bill, which would require power plants, oil refiners and other polluters to pay for the right to release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The goal is to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 66% by 2050. A United Nations scientific panel last year said the world needs to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere by 50% to 85% by 2050 in order to limit damage from climate change.

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- A sweeping proposal to combat global warming by requiring economy-wide reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions appeared headed for defeat in the Senate amid partisan wrangling and concerns among lawmakers about the costs it would impose on American consumers and industry. 
Although the proposal by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.) and John Warner (R., Va.) hadn't been expected to pass this year, supporters had hoped to lay the groundwork for next year's debate by forcing wavering senators on both sides of the aisle to take positions on the matter. 
But the timing of the debate -- with gasoline prices hovering near $4 a gallon on average -- appeared to benefit the bill's opponents, who argued that the measure amounted to a stealth tax on consumers. They said the reductions would put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage against countries like China that don't impose emission caps, and create arbitrary winners and losers. 
In an unusual move that slowed the proposal's progress, Republicans used parliamentary procedures to force the chamber's clerks to read the entire bill, which has about 490 pages, out loud on Wednesday. 
"You can't cram a measure of this magnitude down the throat of the United States Senate or the American people with that little scrutiny or observation," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. 
A vote on whether to continue debate on the Senate proposal is expected Friday. Although it was unclear late Thursday how many favorable votes the bill would elicit among Democrats, there were signs that the legislation wasn't gaining support among certain senators whose votes had been seen as up for grabs. One of those senators, Ken Salazar (D., Colo), said Thursday that the bill didn't provide enough money for the development of renewable energy and for technologies capable of capturing emissions from coal-fired power plants. 
The measure also generated anxiety among Democrats worried that it would encourage U.S. manufacturers to send more jobs overseas. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat, said he wanted to amend the bill to impose trade sanctions on countries that don't cap their emissions. "We can't unilaterally disarm," he said in an interview. 
The global-warming bill backed by Sens. Lieberman and Warner would require that the U.S. reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions roughly 65% by midcentury. It would create a "cap-and-trade" system to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. Companies in capped industries would get permits to pump out a set amount of emissions each year. Those that exceeded the cap would have to buy additional permits from those that received more than they needed. 
The bill would also dole out permits to state and local governments and other entities, which could then use those assets to fund an array of climate-related programs. 
At one time, the bill's backers were hoping to get at least a vote on some parts of it this year, and set principles of compromise that could shape a final bill in the new Congress next year. But on Thursday, Democratic leaders conceded they were short of the 60 votes required to move forward with the legislation. "It's a long shot," Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin (D., Ill.), told reporters. 
The bill's proponents argued that the measure would finance the shift to clean, alternative fuels by making polluters pay and generating billions of dollars that would be invested in high-tech "green-collar" jobs. 
Groups opposed to the Senate measure -- such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and large utilities that rely heavily on coal -- have lobbied hard against the bill, saying it would drive up prices for consumers.

Abstract 
Until now, the U.S. has been free to produce an unlimited amount of carbon dioxide as it burns fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas to power its economic growth. 

Full text 
The U.S. government is preparing to slap a multibillion-dollar price tag on global-warming gases produced in a range of activities from electricity production to manufacturing, and virtually every special interest in the economy is jockeying to minimize its cost. 
The Senate this week is debating a bill that would force companies and consumers to pay for the right to discharge carbon dioxide and other gases widely believed to be contributing to climate change. Though almost no one expects the bill to pass this election year, the political battle lines now forming show how tough it will be to meaningfully cut greenhouse-gas emissions when the fight does get serious, probably next year. 
The bill's goal is aggressive: cutting U.S. emissions about 65% by 2050, a period during which emissions are otherwise expected to rise by about 30%. Whether that is politically achievable is hard to predict. In a move Wednesday to thwart its progress, Senate Republicans used parliamentary procedure to force a reading of the entire 490-odd page bill out loud. 
In the meantime, powerful interests are trying to pepper the bill with provisions to reduce their economic pain -- which also would reduce the mandate for U.S. environmental change. Until now, the U.S. has been free to produce an unlimited amount of carbon dioxide as it burns fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas to power its economic growth. The Senate bill, sponsored by Connecticut Independent Joseph Lieberman and Virginia Republican John Warner, would end that era. 
Under the bill, the government would print a set number of yearly greenhouse-gas pollution "permits" -- some distributed free, and some sold at an auction, reaping billions of dollars for the government. Companies emitting more than their allocated permit supply would have to buy more permits -- a cost they would pass along to their customers. Companies emitting less could sell their extra permits. 
In essence, the bill would amount to an added tax on energy use. And as with any tax bill, companies and special interests are lobbying to bend it to their economic advantage. 
The Senate bill proposes using some of the money raised by permit sales to subsidize wildlife adaptation, forest protection and a host of other causes some critics see as political pork, but which are key to securing support from moderate Democrats whose states depend heavily on coal-fired power. 
General Electric Co. wants to tweak the bill to steer more of the money made off permit sales to fund more-efficient power-plant equipment -- equipment GE sells. "Some cynics will say that obviously that's good for GE," says Peter O'Toole, a GE spokesman. "We don't shrink from that argument at all." 
Dow Chemical Co. wants to preserve a provision in the bill that would give free permits to companies -- like Dow -- that consume lots of natural gas and oil as a raw material to make products. Dow could sell the permits to help offset higher costs generated by the new rules. 
A coalition of electricity producers, farmers and banks wants to give heavy polluters broad leeway to gin up additional permits by funding projects that cut emissions in other places around the world, from U.S. farms to Brazilian forests. Buying permits, also known as credits, this way would be cheaper than spending the money needed to reduce companies' own emissions. 
American Electric Power Co., one of the biggest carbon-dioxide emitters in the U.S., estimates it could buy a credit for about $10, compared with spending roughly $50 to reduce a comparable amount of emissions by retooling its own power plants, says Bruce Braine, the company's vice president for strategic-policy analysis. Through 2030, AEP wants to meet roughly 25% to 30% of its potential emission-cutting obligation by buying credits, giving it time to develop longer-term pollution-control technology, Mr. Braine says. 
A March report from the Environmental Protection Agency pointed to companies' ability to buy extra credits as the most important factor in determining the cost of complying with new emission standards. And a study by New Energy Finance, an industry analysis firm, suggested that if U.S. companies bought the maximum number of extra credits allowed by the bill, "the U.S. would not have to reduce emissions domestically until at least 2030." 
That's not likely to happen, says Kyle Danish, a Washington lawyer who represents the Coalition for Emission Reduction Projects, a group pushing for the use of credits. The bill says foreign credits from forestry projects, one of the least-expensive options, could come only from countries that have implemented certain national emission measurements, something many countries haven't done, notes Mr. Danish. His coalition now is angling to amend the climate bill to make the credits easier to buy, while still, he says, insuring their environmental integrity. 
"We have a tremendous amount of manufacturing in Michigan," says Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.), who plans to introduce such an amendment. "Adding to electricity costs would disproportionately hit manufacturers' costs." 
Opponents of foreign credits say it is too difficult to evaluate the legitimacy of those emission-cutting projects. Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders are pushing a rival amendment in the Senate that would block companies from using any international credits. 
The credits "are fraught with fraud," said Sen. Corker, in an interview. "I think it's reprehensible that it would be a part of this legislation."

How About a Cap-and-Trade Dividend?

Abstract 
[...] it's a certainty that we'll have a president next year who wants to address global warming by imposing an overall cap on U.S. carbon emissions. In economic terms, such a carbon auction is the equivalent of a carbon tax, and it makes more sense than a system that allocates permits on the basis of how much greenhouse gas a company or industry already emits. 

Full Text 
The Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade bill is going nowhere. Even in the unlikely event Congress passes it, President Bush has said he will veto the measure, and there aren't nearly enough votes to override. So the real action commences on Jan. 20, 2009, when a new administration takes over. Barack Obama is on record in favor of cap and trade. And so, significantly, is John McCain. 
In fact, Sen. McCain has been among the strongest backers of the Lieberman-Warner bill. Last October, he said he was "bitterly disappointed" by U.S. inaction on climate change so far. "The Europeans implemented a cap-and-trade system; they stumbled and had their problems, but it is still the right thing to do," he said. 
So it's a certainty that we'll have a president next year who wants to address global warming by imposing an overall cap on U.S. carbon emissions. The "trade" part of the equation would allow companies finding efficient ways to cut emissions to sell the unused portions of their permits to others. 
Sen. Obama's proposal is more ambitious than Sen. McCain's in terms of how fast the overall cap would drop. But the biggest difference between Messrs. McCain and Obama is how the permits would be allocated. Mr. McCain's proposal would initially give out most of them for free to the nation's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. This does have some logic to it: after all, as the overall cap tightens each year, the biggest polluters will face the largest challenges in cutting emissions. 
By contrast, Mr. Obama has proposed allocating the permits through an auction. Under his proposal, every company -- large or small -- would have to buy the rights to emit greenhouse gases. As a result, the biggest emitters would have to pay the most -- thereby providing them with the greatest incentive to cut emissions right from the start. In economic terms, such a carbon auction is the equivalent of a carbon tax, and it makes more sense than a system that allocates permits on the basis of how much greenhouse gas a company or industry already emits. Companies and industries that impose the largest social costs in terms of such emissions should be given the greatest incentives to cut costs immediately. 
Moreover, carbon auctions invite far less political maneuvering. Setting initial allocations by emissions invites every big corporation and industry to fight for the biggest possible allocation and claim the largest emissions. Despite Mr. McCain's avowed determination to reduce the influence of lobbyists in Washington, the resulting free- for-all would be a bonanza for K Street. 
In fact, one likely result would be the issuance of so many permits as to break the overall cap. This is one reason why cap-and-trade hasn't worked very well in Europe so far. Since the European Union adopted the system three years ago, carbon emissions are actually up by several percentage points. The EU gave initial permits away for free, and many companies discovered clever ways to grab even more of them than their previous emissions would warrant. 
Mr. McCain hasn't completely ruled out a carbon auction. In fact, the Lieberman-Warner bill he supports would auction off some permits -- at first a few, and more as time goes on. Over the life of the bill, half of the permits would be handed out for free, half by auction. 
But carbon auctions raise another problem when it comes to Washington. Revenues from the auctions are likely to be fish bait to industries that might qualify for some of them. Sen. Joe Lieberman estimates that the market value of all permits under his bill would be about $7 trillion by 2050. That sum would go into what he calls a Climate Change Credit Corporation, which, operating outside the budget process, would invest in various plans for developing alternative energy. You can bet that lobbyists for ethanol, nuclear and "clean" coal are already salivating at the prospect of a similar fund emerging from a bill championed by a President McCain or President Obama. 
That's why it's important that all revenues from carbon auctions be cycled back to citizens. And rather than launch another endless debate over how and to whom -- a payroll tax cut for people earning under the median wage, or a cut in capital gains? -- it would be well to agree to the simplest possible formula: Every adult citizen should receive an equal share. If the carbon auction yields $150 billion in the first year, for example, each of America's 150 million adult citizens should receive a Treasury check that year of $1,000. 
Such direct and simple repayments deal with another problem. Although the balance of economic studies suggest that the cost of a cap-and-trade system will be modest, inevitably some costs will be involved and be passed along to consumers who are already walloped by high fuel and food costs and who will be in no mood to accept even modest additional price increases. Hence, the yearly dividend checks will be a welcome offset. 
Our atmosphere belongs to all of us. It seems only reasonable that corporations should have to pay to use it. The citizens of Alaska and Alberta, Canada, get yearly dividends from the oil companies that take away their natural resources. Why shouldn't the same principle apply when industries use the biggest common resource of all?

U.S. News: Coal States in Climate-Bill Fight; Miners Would Lose With Carbon Caps; Sen. Byrd Says 'No'

Abstract 
Coal producers would suffer in particular because coal-fired power plants release about twice as much carbon dioxide as is emitted by comparable natural-gas-fired plants. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- The direction Congress takes on proposals to cap greenhouse gases could depend on coal-rich states such as West Virginia, which has some of the nation's poorest households, but is rich in both coal and political clout. 
The second-poorest state in the nation based on household income, West Virginia counts on coal to support its economy. West Virginia coal companies are big suppliers to the coal-fired power plants that provide half of the U.S.'s electricity. But coal demand likely would be reduced if Congress votes to put caps on greenhouse-gas emissions and compel companies to buy permits to burn coal or oil. 
That is putting pressure on West Virginia's senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both Democrats. Many Democratic Party leaders are pushing for action on climate change as a moral imperative and arguing it will help U.S. competitiveness as well. 
But with coal accounting for an estimated 8% of West Virginia's general revenue fund, the risks to the state's economy are big enough that the two Democrats may not be willing to fall in line with their party. 
The significance of the issue was on display Monday, when Sen. Byrd was among the first on the Senate floor when a vote began on whether, in essence, to go forward on the bill. From his wheelchair, the 90- year-old Sen. Byrd cast the first "no" vote, making him the only Democrat to vote against holding a vote on the legislation. 
Senators from other big coal states such as Kentucky and Wyoming were among the 13 Republicans to vote "no." 
Other Democrats also may be unwilling to follow their party. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu has a history of breaking with the party on energy legislation opposed by oil companies, as is the climate- change bill. Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota has said that he doesn't know enough about the climate-change bill and may not be able to support it. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said Tuesday that he can't support the bill without changes that will address concerns of manufacturers. 
The coal industry is reacting to the possible effects of legislation that aims to reduce emissions 66% below 2005 levels by 2050. Under the bill, polluters would have to buy allowances to cover emissions released into the atmosphere, up to the limit permitted under the law. 
Coal producers would suffer in particular because coal-fired power plants release about twice as much carbon dioxide as is emitted by comparable natural-gas-fired plants. Total coal consumption would be between 62% and 89% lower than what would otherwise be the case, government forecasts show, because the fuel wouldn't be as economical once the costs of pollution allowances are factored in. 
Senate supporters have emphasized they want cheap and abundant coal to remain a big part of the nation's fuel mix. Sen. John Warner (R., Va.), one of the bill's sponsors, plans to make a new pitch to coal states and hopes to offer an amendment that would give the president the power to modify the law. 
"This bill does not in any way try to damage coal," Sen. Warner said on the Senate floor Monday. Referring to new technology that would sequester emissions from coal-fired plants, he said, "if that technology is not in place in a timely way, the president can step in and readjust the timetable." 
The technology to capture the carbon dioxide emitted from coal- burning power plants and store it underground isn't yet available on a large-scale commercial basis. 
Seeking to jump-start this clean-coal technology, the Senate bill would auction off 1% of the total pollution allowances allotted for the period through 2025, and use the proceeds to fund work on carbon capture and sequestration. At an estimated $15.7 billion, the fund would dwarf the amount the Energy Department is now spending on six carbon-capture and storage-demonstration projects. 
But if the technology isn't available, and with emissions capped at 2005 levels in 2012 and then cut by a third by 2030, mining interests said power plants might either switch to natural gas -- which might be cheaper than coal once the costs of polluting are factored in -- or pass along price increases to customers. 
Even if carbon-capture and storage technology becomes viable, coal still will suffer, according to government forecasts, as existing coal-fired power plants are retired early because of the impracticality of retrofitting the facilities with the new storage technology. The building of cleaner coal facilities wouldn't be enough to offset the replacement of older coal-fired plants, the Energy Information Administration forecasts, resulting in reduced demand for coal.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
When oil hit $40 and then $70, this column was serene. With a couple billion Chinese, Indians and others joining the global marketplace, they will need energy, and lots of it. The price mechanism is our only hope. 
Sure enough, it's working. Money is pouring into Canada's massive tar sands. A thousand substitutions are taking place on the demand side. Sales of SUVs are falling; sales of four-cylinder sedans are up. The number of miles driven by American motorists shrank in February for the first time in 26 years. 
At $70 a barrel, we worried only that the folly of India and China in artificially holding down prices to consumers would spread. The news is happy here too. Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia are cutting back subsidies or thinking about it. India and China may not let prices float anytime soon, but they're letting gas lines and spot shortages ration supply anyway. 
If today's towering price of oil reflects some speculator's bet on a long-term scarcity of liquid motor fuels, this will prove the misguided bet of a lifetime. Hydrocarbons are abundant, and can be extracted from living plant matter as well as from their fossil remains. Many oil fields under current technology are considered depleted when they're still 50% full. But technology advances, doesn't it? 
Yet there's one miracle of adaptation that even $135 oil apparently can't vouchsafe. It can't bring intellectual coherence to American rhetoric or policy on energy. 
By one count, America sits on enough oil and gas to meet its own needs for half a century. We won't help ourselves although our environmental delicacy somehow doesn't stop us from screaming at other countries to tear up their own pristine wildernesses to supply us with cheap energy. President Bush rushes to the Saudis, supplicating for more oil. Congress threatens OPEC with antitrust action. Go figure. That U.S. politicians can afford to indulge a persistent unreality about a basic input of industrial civilization only testifies to how responsive and resilient the global energy market has been despite the political silliness it meets at every turn. 
But the biggest fools today may be those greenies who are clapping their hands over $135 oil as if this somehow represents the beginning of the end of fossil fuels. High prices are not the equivalent of carbon taxes -- they will have the opposite effect in the long run, spurring investment and technological progress to bring vast new resources of fossil energy into production. For instance, turning coal, oil sands and oil shale into motor fuels, which is cost- effective at half of today's oil price, means massive additional releases of CO2. It's the worst nightmare of the climate worrywarts. 
Here, we offer advice to those whose cause we don't necessarily share. Politicians may not find $135 oil sufficient incentive to grow up, but the global warming crowd should. 
Growing up would begin with recognizing that science doesn't prove the case against CO2. Our political system has been looking at the problem of climate change for a generation, and lack of action is not due to the machinations of big oil -- but to the inability of policy to bridge a giant chasm between proposed costs and benefits. Even if carbon's guilt is assumed, the economics are far from certain that it wouldn't be cheaper just to endure a changing climate. 
Growing up would also mean realizing that climate activists are in danger of losing all political credibility as they become handmaidens to corrupt pork bonanzas for the corn ethanol lobby and Silicon Valley alternative energy impresarios. Look no further than the climate bill being debated on Capitol Hill this week. The only real question it poses is how much Congress will spend on climate pork while having no discernible impact on climate. 
Finally, growing up means recognizing that their one politically and morally saleable proposition is to offer carbon taxes as a de facto consumption tax, with the proceeds used to offset labor and capital taxes that discourage work and investment. This would be a case of taxing "bads" not "goods," with benefits for growth and the average voter's bottom line independent of any problematic evidence about CO2 and climate. 
Voters and their representatives then could at least contemplate supporting a climate policy on cost-benefit grounds, rather than on the religious posturing that Al Gore and others adopt to push what they can't sell rationally. Will the greens learn these lessons? Not likely -- which is why $135 oil may prove the beginning of the end of any political movement to do anything about climate change.

Abstract 
An election-year debate over how the U.S. should respond to climate change began in earnest, as President Bush warned he would veto a Senate bill, and congressional Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to define the climate-change issue to their advantage. Monday, Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.), who once suggested global warming is a "hoax," opened the Republican Party's attack on the Lieberman-Warner measure by largely focusing on the bill's potential costs and its impact on U.S. economic competitiveness relative to developing nations that don't cap greenhouse-gas emissions.

WASHINGTON -- An election-year debate over how the U.S. should respond to climate change began in earnest, as President Bush warned he would veto a Senate bill, and congressional Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to define the climate-change issue to their advantage. 
While it is unlikely Congress will send Mr. Bush a climate-change bill before he leaves office, the debate that began Monday in the Senate will set a framework for how the issue is perceived by voters this fall. 
Democrats want their willingness to act to curb greenhouse gases to be seen as evidence they will tackle tough issues they say Mr. Bush and the Republicans have ignored. 
Republicans are making a tactical shift to oppose a bill up for debate this week in the Senate. After opposing any caps on greenhouse- gas emissions, they now argue that the draft bill goes too far in regulating the economy, in part by potentially raking in trillions of dollars to fund government programs over the next 42 years. 
The Senate bill also is stirring up arguments about whether action to curb greenhouse gases will create a new set of winners and losers in the world's largest economy and whether voters are prepared to embrace higher energy costs for the sake of the environment. 
At its core, the legislation would create a "cap-and-trade" system to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. Companies in capped industries would get permits to spew a set amount of emissions each year. Those that exceed the cap would have to buy additional permits from those that received more than they needed. The bill would also dole out permits to state and local governments and other entities, which could then use those assets to fund an array of climate-related programs. 
The bill's proponents say the measure would finance the shift to clean, alternative fuels by making polluters pay and generating billions of dollars that would be invested in high-tech "green-collar" jobs. The bill's opponents argue that the measure amounts to a stealth tax on consumers that will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage against countries like China that don't operate such caps, and create arbitrary winners and losers while setting unrealistic emissions goals. 
With the White House formally threatening to veto the Senate measure, few in Washington expect the proposal to become law this year. 
All three major-party presidential candidates have publicly expressed support for some form of an emissions-trading system covering greenhouse gases, although they differ on details. 
Mr. Bush highlighted the shifting battle lines Monday when he criticized the proposal by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.) and John Warner (R., Va.), saying it would cost the economy $6 trillion. But Mr. Bush didn't slam the door on taking action to reduce emissions. 
The bill's supporters argue that any delay in imposing economywide carbon caps will impose its own costs, including real-estate losses caused by higher sea levels and hurricane damage. "The longer we wait, the more painful -- and expensive -- the consequences will be," a report published last month by the Natural Resources Defense Council said. If warming trends continue, the report said, the U.S. economy could be affected to the tune of $1.9 trillion annually by 2100. 
The Lieberman-Warner bill aims to cut U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions roughly 66% by 2050 by creating a cap-and-trade system. 
The question for business is whether polluters will find economical ways to survive under ever-stricter emissions limits. Even within some industries, the rewards and penalties would vary from company to company and from region to region. 
Electricity utilities, which account for almost 40% of carbon- dioxide emissions, face the starkest consequences. Companies such as FPL Group Inc., which runs the world's biggest solar-power facility, would be better positioned than companies such as Duke Energy Corp., which describes itself as the third-largest coal user in the country, burning about 46 million tons a year. Nuclear power would gain a big advantage because such plants emit no greenhouse gases. 
Monday, Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.), who once suggested global warming is a "hoax," opened the Republican Party's attack on the Lieberman-Warner measure by largely focusing on the bill's potential costs and its impact on U.S. economic competitiveness relative to developing nations that don't cap greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Supporters of the Lieberman-Warner measure say an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency said the legislation could be implemented without significantly hurting 
U.S. economic growth. But the analysis also projected sharp increases in gasoline and electricity prices if the bill is implemented. 
Less debated is the amount of money the bill is expected to raise through the auctioning of permits -- as much as $3.3 trillion over the next 42 years. 
"This bill isn't just a cap-and-trade bill; it's a spending bill," Sen. Bob Corker (R. Tenn.) said in an interview. Mr. Corker, who joined the Senate less than two years ago, is one of several Senate Republicans who have expressed willingness to support a cap-and -trade system covering greenhouse-gas emissions. 
But Mr. Corker says he wants to ensure that a larger portion of money raised through the auctioning of permits is refunded to taxpayers. Under the proposal by Sens. Lieberman and Warner, most of the revenue generated by such auctions would be set aside for various programs, including the development of clean-energy technologies.

Abstract 
Tomorrow's energy mix must include more natural gas, wind and geothermal, but it must also include oil, coal and nuclear power, which is the world's largest source of emission-free energy. 

Full Text 
With average gas prices across the country approaching $4 a gallon, it may be hard to believe, but the U.S. Senate is considering legislation this week that will further drive up the cost at the pump. 
The Senate is debating a global warming bill that will create the largest expansion of the federal government since FDR's New Deal, complete with a brand new, unelected bureaucracy. The Lieberman-Warner bill (America's Climate Security Act) represents the largest tax increase in U.S. history and the biggest pork bill ever contemplated with trillions of dollars in giveaways. Well-heeled lobbyists are already plotting how to divide up the federal largesse. The handouts offered by the sponsors of this bill come straight from the pockets of families and workers in the form of lost jobs, higher gas, power and heating bills, and more expensive consumer goods. 
Various analyses show that Lieberman-Warner would result in higher prices at the gas pump, between 41 cents and $1 per gallon by 2030. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says Lieberman-Warner would effectively raise taxes on Americans by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The federal Energy Information Administration says the bill would result in a 9.5% drop in manufacturing output and higher energy costs. 
Carbon caps will have an especially harmful impact on low-income Americans and those with fixed incomes. A recent CBO report found: "Most of the cost of meeting a cap on CO2 emissions would be borne by consumers, who would face persistently higher prices for products such as electricity and gasoline. Those price increases would be regressive in that poorer households would bear a larger burden relative to their income than wealthier households." 
The poor already face energy costs as a much higher percentage of their income than wealthier Americans. While most Americans spend about 4% of their monthly budget on heating their homes or other energy needs, the poorest fifth of Americans spend 19%. A 2006 survey of Colorado homeless families with children found that high energy bills were cited as one of the two main reasons they became homeless. 
Lieberman-Warner will also hinder U.S. competitiveness, transferring American jobs overseas to places where environmental regulations are much more lenient. Instead of working to eliminate trade barriers on clean energy and lower emitting technologies, the bill imposes a "green," tariff-style tax on imported goods. This could provoke international retaliatory actions by our trade partners, threatening our own export markets and further driving up the costs of consumer goods. 
My colleague, Sen. George Voinovich (R., Ohio), warned last week that Lieberman-Warner "could result in the most massive bureaucratic intrusion into the lives of Americans since the creation of the Internal Revenue Service." Mandating burdensome new layers of federal bureaucracy is not the solution to America's energy challenges. 
This bill is ultimately about certainty. We are certain of the huge negative impact on the economy as detailed by numerous government and private analyses. We are certain of the massive expansion of the federal bureaucracy. 
And we are certain the bill will not have a detectable impact on the climate. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's own analysis, by 2050 Lieberman-Warner would only lower global CO2 concentrations by less than 1.4% without additional international action. In fact, this bill, often touted as an "insurance policy" against global warming, is instead all economic pain for no climate gain. 
Why are many in Washington proposing a bill that will do so much economic harm? The answer is simple. The American people are being asked to pay significantly more for energy merely so some lawmakers in Washington can say they did something about global warming. 
I have been battling global warming alarmism since 2003, when I became chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It has been a lonely battle at times, but it now appears that many of my colleagues are waking up to the reality of cap-and-trade legislation. 
The better way forward is an energy policy that emphasizes technology and includes developing nations such as China and India. Tomorrow's energy mix must include more natural gas, wind and geothermal, but it must also include oil, coal and nuclear power, which is the world's largest source of emission-free energy. Developing and expanding domestic energy sources will translate into energy security and ensure stable supplies and well-paying jobs for Americans. 
Let me end with a challenge to my colleagues. Will you dare stand on the Senate floor in these uncertain economic times and vote in favor of significantly increasing the price of gas at the pump, losing millions of American jobs, creating a huge new bureaucracy and raising taxes by record amounts? The American people deserve and expect a full debate on this legislation. 
Mr. Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, is ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

Abstract 
[...] the environmentalists have stopped our exploration for fossil fuels, stopped our expansion of nuclear energy, stopped our production of coal-fired power plants, and now have convinced Congress to turn our food into energy, starving millions. 

Full Text 
Mackubin Thomas Owens's op-ed "Blame Congress for High Oil Prices" (May 29) is great, except it only touches on how the environmentalists are killing our economy and now people, too. 
Congress has bought into the so-called global warming issue despite the fact that 32,000 scientists recently signed a petition stating that man's being the cause of any warming was suspect at best. Even Jupiter warmed up one degree this year. Did we do this? 
As a result, we have taken 30% of our corn to make 3% of our fuel. It takes one gallon of gas to make 1 1/3 gallons of ethanol. Ethanol then burns 80% as efficient for no net gain. But it's cleaner! 
So the environmentalists have stopped our exploration for fossil fuels, stopped our expansion of nuclear energy, stopped our production of coal-fired power plants, and now have convinced Congress to turn our food into energy, starving millions. 
Global warming is killing people -- they are right -- not by any potential warming, but by starvation and lack of energy.

Abstract 
Coal, which has the highest level of emissions of all fossil fuels, is used in power plants that produce about half the electricity in the U.S. On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a conservative group, announced the start of a radio- and TV-ad campaign against the bill in states whose senators are viewed as potential swing votes. 

Full text 
As the U.S. considers a plan to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by big polluters, lawmakers are hoping to avoid the pitfalls of a similar system adopted in Europe. 
The Senate is expected Monday to begin debating legislation that could impose mandatory limits on greenhouse-gas emissions by industry. 
The legislation would create a market-based system similar to one in Europe that caps the amount of carbon dioxide that companies such as power generators and steel and cement makers are allowed to put out. If companies emit more than their cap allows, they must buy "carbon permits" on the market from companies that have extra ones. This "cap- and-trade" system is designed to give companies a financial incentive to clean up. 
Pressure on the U.S. to curb greenhouse-gas emissions is mounting amid new evidence of specific threats to the U.S. from man-made global warming. A report published Thursday by the Bush administration said it is "likely" that there has been "a substantial human contribution to" rising surface temperatures in North America and that climate change will have "significant effects" on the country. For instance, the annual number of heat-related deaths in Los Angeles is projected to increase to 1,182 in the 2080s from about 165 in the 1990s. 
The White House has long resisted formally declaring that greenhouse-gas emissions endanger public health or welfare, the legal prerequisite to regulating them. 
When Europe launched its system in 2005 as a way to meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol, it cast itself as a leader in the fight against global warming. The U.S., which didn't sign on to Kyoto, was criticized for being a laggard. 
But Europe's first three years of cap-and-trade encountered problems, and emissions have risen instead of fallen. European regulators note that the program has just completed its pilot phase, but they acknowledge that changes are needed. 
Europe's early troubles are being noted in the U.S. The bill's opponents have seized on the problems in Europe and argued that the bill could further raise energy costs at a time when average gasoline prices in the U.S. are about $4 a gallon. The bill's supporters, on the other hand, believe that if they can correct Europe's errors on cap-and-trade, the system could be a model for the rest of the world. 
Whether the U.S. succeeds in crafting a policy that reduces emissions without crimping economic expansion depends to a degree on battles over the legislative fine print. While few observers believe a climate-change bill will be enacted this year, especially with President Bush likely to veto any cap-and-trade bill, the debate is expected to be the foundation for a law to be passed next year. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.) who is co-sponsor with Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia of the leading proposal, says he has been trying to learn from Europe's example. "We're watching them, and they're watching us," he said. 
Messrs. Lieberman and Warner met frequently with European officials from government and industry as they crafted their bill, and various congressional committees have heard testimony about how Europe's carbon-trading system works. 
One of the pitfalls the Lieberman-Warner bill is trying to avoid is a situation in which power companies record windfall profits as they raise electricity prices for consumers and business. In Europe, power companies received most of their carbon permits free in the start-up phase, but some raised rates all the same, arguing emissions policies had raised their costs of production. In Germany, heavy-industrial companies saw their electricity costs jump, while major power producers' profits soared. 
Instead of giving away all the permits, the Lieberman-Warner bill proposes to auction a quarter of the permits in 2012 when the program starts. Over time, the share auctioned off would rise, until some 70% are auctioned off by 2031. Making companies pay for permits rewards companies with cleaner operations and ensures that the cheapest, most efficient technologies are adopted first. 
While some argue that the auction is a fairer way to allocate the right to pollute, it will be contentious among utilities and their congressional advocates from coal-producing states such as West Virginia. 
Coal, which has the highest level of emissions of all fossil fuels, is used in power plants that produce about half the electricity in the U.S. 
On Tuesday, the Club for Growth, a conservative group, announced the start of a radio- and TV-ad campaign against the bill in states whose senators are viewed as potential swing votes. 
Some in Congress are concerned that a cap-and-trade system could be an added burden on family budgets. "My constituents are saying to me, 'Well...if we're going to embark on this kind of a policy, what does it mean to me and my household? Because right now, we're getting socked when it comes to the cost of energy,'" Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., 
Alaska) said at a hearing last week. 
She noted that federal and private studies of the bill's impact on cost increases per household have ranged from as little as $76 a year to as much as $723 a year by 2030. 
The biggest criticism of Europe's cap-and-trade system is that, despite the added costs, emissions have crept up about 1% a year since 2005. During the same period in the U.S., emissions bounced up and down in response to changing economic conditions. They were up 0.6% in 2005, down 1.3% in 2006, and up 1.6% in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
The failure of Europe's system to shrink emissions is due primarily to one policy blunder: Governments handed out too many carbon permits. When regulators were designing the system, they based the caps on emissions estimates provided by countries, which got estimates from companies. In 2006, the first year actual national-emissions data became available, it turned out that many factories had been given far too many permits. 
That meant that companies had no incentive to revamp their factories or install lower-emissions technology. "The allocation process was tremendously flawed," says Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) who met with EU officials during a trip last year. 
Supporters of the Lieberman-Warner bill say the U.S. will avoid that error because the Environmental Protection Agency has tracked greenhouse-gas emissions from industries for years. 
The excessive number of permits granted in Europe caused the price of a permit to collapse to nearly zero in 2006. Such volatility makes it difficult for companies to make long­term decisions to adopt low- carbon technologies.

Abstract 
(Accidents involving trains carrying hazardous material have been declining slightly over the past decade, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.) Freight trains now use much cleaner and more fuel-efficient diesel engines, and railroad companies are testing new engines that the industry is touting as "ultralow-emission." 

Full Text 
A new CSX Corp. radio ad declares that even the most fuel-efficient hybrid car can't compete with a train, which "can move a ton of freight 423 miles on a single gallon of fuel." 
"Too bad we can't all drive a train," the announcer says before urging listeners to visit CSX's Web site to learn about the Jacksonville, Fla., company's "commitment to protecting the environment." 
Railroad companies, long a target of environmentalists who blame them for everything from deforestation to toxic spills, are marketing themselves as the ultimate eco-friendly, low-fuel-consuming industry. 
With fuel prices at record highs and worries about global warming reaching critical mass, U.S. companies of all stripes are touting their green credentials. That list includes plenty of businesses that wouldn't normally be associated with the environmental movement, like oil companies or mining outfits. But the juxtaposition for trains is among the starkest. 
Early in the 20th century, steam-powered trains, fueled by coal, cast off trails of embers that often ignited and denuded the surrounding landscape. Train accidents and cargo spills still taint perceptions of railroad companies. Earlier this month, a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train partially derailed in Lafayette, La., and began leaking hydrochloric acid. Several thousand people were forced to evacuate. (Accidents involving trains carrying hazardous material have been declining slightly over the past decade, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.) 
Freight trains now use much cleaner and more fuel-efficient diesel engines, and railroad companies are testing new engines that the industry is touting as "ultralow-emission." Many environmentalists acknowledge that the railroads have a powerful argument, given that freight trains burn far less fuel than trucks and can help reduce highway congestion. 
"In general, train transportation is much more fuel efficient than trucking, and we should be doing more of it," says Colin F. Peppard, transportation policy coordinator for Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group. 
Several rail companies are rolling out their own statistics to make the case that the switch to trains is good for the environment. Norfolk Southern Corp. is running a series of environmentally themed television spots and has a "carbon footprint analyzer" feature on its Web site that allows customers to measure the environmental advantages of shipping by freight rather than truck. 
Union Pacific Corp.'s Web site touts the company's "cleaner and greener" fleet of locomotives and argues that if 25% of truck freight was diverted to rail, there would be "nearly 800,000 fewer tons of air pollution" by 2025. 
Much rides on this approach. For the first time in decades, railroad stock prices have been rising, and business is booming. By one estimate, the railroad industry will need to expand its capacity by 88% in the next quarter-century, as highways get even more congested, fuel prices rise and more shippers decide to use trains to move their products. What's more, railroads -- which used to carry mainly raw materials such as coal and timber -- are now increasingly transporting consumer goods from ports to cities. 
As the industry begins billions of dollars worth of system improvements, it is increasingly seeking public money to help pay for some of the expansion projects. Norfolk Southern, for example, is seeking public funding to help pay to upgrade the Crescent Corridor, a network of routes between the New York City area and New Orleans. The industry is also asking Congress to pass a proposed bill that would give railroads tax credits for money spent on track expansion. 
The railroad industry is also trying to fend off calls for tougher federal regulations that would make it easier for shippers to challenge prices in areas where a railroad has a monopoly. 
Some environmentalists say the industry hasn't done enough. In the Los Angeles/Long Beach area, environmental groups are battling Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., which are seeking to expand and modernize their rail-yard operations in the neighborhoods surrounding the nation's busiest port system. 
Last year, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which monitors air quality in the Los Angeles region, released a statement accusing the railroads of "spew(ing) toxic diesel soot into neighborhoods, backyards and school yards, posing health risk to residents." 
"From our viewpoint, it just seems that they've been extremely recalcitrant and stubborn in terms of being willing to adopt cost- effective measures that will reduce air pollution," said Sam G. Atwood, the district's spokesman. 
Union Pacific Chief Executive James Young says that a certain amount of community resistance is inevitable whenever a business tries to expand. "You have the not-in-my­backyard mentality," he said. 
Norfolk Southern executives say they first began to hone their eco- friendly message about three years ago with a television ad showing a tree lifting a freight container off a busy highway and placing it on a train. 
Norfolk Southern's latest ads -- a campaign dubbed "The Lonely Gallon," showing a family of gas cans looking on forlornly as a train whizzes by -- will air roughly 400 times during the fall election season, the company said. 
Dunkin' Donuts Pulls 
Ray Ad Over Scarf 
Dunkin' Donuts has pulled an online ad featuring the Rachael Ray after bloggers said the scarf she was wearing in the commercial looked like a kaffiyeh, a traditional Arab scarf. Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin wrote about the ad: "The kaffiyeh, for the clueless, is the traditional scarf of Arab men that has come to symbolize murderous Palestinian jihad." 
In the ad, the popular cook was wearing a black-and-white silk scarf with a paisley design. It was selected by a stylist for the ad shoot, says the coffee chain. "Absolutely no symbolism was intended," said a statement from Margie Myers, senior vice president of communications for Dunkin' Brands. "We are no longer using the online ad because the possibility of misperception detracted from its original intention to promote our iced coffee."

Full Text 
In response to the article "Saudis Rebuff Bush on Oil" (page one, May 17), it should not be a surprise that Saudi Arabia did not feel the need to help the world energy situation by increasing production again. Saudi Arabia is itself beginning to peak in oil production, and it is in their interest to stretch out their reserves as far as possible. Every barrel they leave in the ground is likely to be worth more in the future than it is today. 
Perhaps the biggest issue is that we are unwilling to open more of our own areas for exploration and production. Our attitude, to the rest of the world, seems to be: "You produce your oil and ship it to us but we will not produce our own. The environmental cost is too high for us, but not for you. And by the way, we do not want to pay very much for it either." 
The best message we could send the oil world now would be to show the political courage and will needed to have Congress vote to open up more of our own resources. 
David Stackelhouse 
Lee's Summit, Mo. 
Regarding your editorial "Beseeching the Saudis" (May 17): President Bush is beseeching the wrong people. He would do better by beseeching the U.S. Congress, the state governors and the American public. In my opinion, we have only ourselves to blame for the energy situation. 
Congress, state governments, environmental groups and global warming advocates have all placed roadblocks in the way of developing our own energy sources, especially oil. We should go all out in our development of our own oil resources, both onshore and offshore. At best, alternative energy sources will only represent a small fraction of our energy needs, for decades to come. And, yes, we should continue to aggressively develop them. 
The blame lies here at home for not exploiting our own resources in a responsible way. Other countries have been drilling offshore successfully, without harm to the environment, for a long time. France is the best example in developing nuclear energy to reduce reliance on oil and coal for electricity. 
The oil companies are not the bad guys. We put all kinds of obstacles in their way and then complain they aren't keeping prices down. It is, after all, a free market, much to the dismay of many who govern us. 
Oil is the engine of our economic growth now and for the foreseeable future. Let's do something about creating our own energy independence. 
David A. Cole 
Alexandria, Va. 
As oil prices steadily climb, the U.S. goes begging to the Saudis for increased production. When told no, we threaten to take our guns and go home, sue OPEC and add more red tape to oil trading regulations. Meanwhile, we sit on top of billions of barrels of oil in Alaska and off our coastlines, but refuse to drill for fear of imposing some unknown harm to the environment. 
Vincent P.A. Benedict 
Collegeville, Pa. 
The energy crisis was clearly identified by your listing of Congress's "grab bag" of ideas. 
1) Congress would withold arms sales to Saudi Arabia unless they ramp up production by one million barrels per day. The Saudis have other sources of arms. What makes you think it is easy for Saudi Arabia to ramp up production by that much? How do you know increasing demand in China, India, Russia and the Middle East itself won't suck up the new production and have essentially no effect on prices? 
2) Open OPEC up to U.S. anticollusion lawsuits. Is suing the providers of oil really a good way of encouraging them to send you more oil? This is simply ridiculous. 
3) Tightening regulation of oil trading. Why don't we let the Federal Reserve take over oil trading like they did Bear Stearns? 
It's obvious to everyone but the U.S. government that we need a comprehensive energy policy. 
Mike Fitzsimmons 
Crossville, Tenn. 

President Bush will not talk to unsavory dictators but apparently has no qualms about begging from them.

Abstract 
Almost all economic activity requires energy, and about 85% of U.S. energy generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 

Full Text 
The global warming debate arrives in the Senate next week, and it's about time. Finally, the Members will have to vote on something real, as opposed to their buck-passing to courts and regulators, and their easy trashing of President Bush. 
The vehicle is a bill that principal sponsors Joe Lieberman and John Warner are calling "landmark legislation." They're too modest. Warner- Lieberman would impose the most extensive government reorganization of the American economy since the 1930s. 
Thankfully, the American system makes it hard for colossal tax and regulatory burdens to foxtrot into law without scrutiny. So we hope our politicians will take responsibility for the global-warming policies they say they favor. Or even begin to understand what they say they favor. For a bill as grandly ambitious as Warner-Lieberman, very few staff, much less Senators, even know what's in it. The press corps mainly cheerleads this political fad, without examining how it would work or what it would cost. So allow us to fill in some of the details. 
Almost all economic activity requires energy, and about 85% of U.S. energy generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. For centuries, these emissions were considered the natural byproduct of combustion. As recently as the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, they were consciously not even described as a "pollutant." But now that the politicians want to decrease those emissions, the government must create a new commodity -- the right to create CO2 -- and put a price on it. This is an unprecedented tax that would profoundly touch every corner of American life. 
The policy preferred by the environmental lobby is called cap and trade. The government would set a limit on emissions that declines every year. The goal of Warner-Lieberman is to return to 2005 levels by 2012, and to reduce that by 30% by 2030. 
"Allowances" for emissions would be distributed to covered businesses -- power, oil, gas, heavy industry, manufacturing, etc. If they produced less than their allotment, the companies could sell the allowances, or trade them. Cap and trade limits on energy are thus sometimes misleadingly described as a "free-market" policy that would create the flexibility for CO2 reductions how and where they are least expensive. But the limits are still a huge tax. 
And for the most part, the politicians favor cap and trade because it is an indirect tax. A direct tax -- say, on gasoline -- would be far more transparent, but it would also be unpopular. Cap and trade is a tax imposed on business, disguising the true costs and thus making it more politically palatable. In reality, firms will merely pass on these costs to customers, and ultimately down the energy chain to all Americans. Higher prices are what are supposed to motivate the investments and behavioral changes required to use less carbon. 
The other reason politicians like cap and trade is because it gives them a cut of the action and the ability to pick winners and losers. Some of the allowances would be given away, at least at the start, while the rest would be auctioned off, with the share of auctions increasing over time. This is a giant revenue grab. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these auctions would net $304 billion by 2013 and $1.19 trillion over the next decade. Since the government controls the number and distribution of allowances, it is also handing itself the political right to influence the price of every good and service in the economy. 
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this meddling would cause a cumulative reduction in the growth of GDP by between 0.9% and 3.8% by 2030. Add 20 years, and the reduction is between 2.4% and 6.9% -- that is, from $1 trillion to $2.8 trillion. 
These estimates assume that electricity prices will increase by 44% above what they would otherwise be by 2030. They also assume that existing coal-fired power plants, which currently provide about 50% of U.S. electric power, will be shut down -- to be replaced with at least 150% growth in new nuclear facilities, plus other "alternatives." Yet there are only 104 current U.S. nuclear plants, and the industry itself says it's optimistic to think even 30 more can be built by 2020. 
In fact, it is pointless to project so far out over multiple decades, since no one knows how markets and consumers would respond, whether the rules would remain constant, or what new technologies might come along. While moralizing about America, most of Europe has failed to meet its mandatory cap and trade goals under the Kyoto Protocol. But the U.S. isn't Italy; we will enforce our laws. So our guess is that these cost estimates are invariably far too low. 
In a bow to this reality, California Democrat Barbara Boxer last week introduced 157 pages of amendments to Warner-Lieberman. Most notably, she sets aside at least $800 billion through 2050 for consumer tax relief. So while imposing a huge new tax on all Americans, she vouchsafes to return some of the money to some people. Needless to say, the Senator will be the judge of who receives her dispensation. 
Ms. Boxer's amendment shows that cap and trade is also a massive wealth redistribution scheme -- all mediated by her and her fellow Platonic rulers. Oh, and she also includes an "emergency off-ramp," should costs prove too onerous. This is really a political "off-ramp" to make Warner-Lieberman seem less dangerous, but you can imagine her reaction if some future Republican President decided to take it. 
The upshot is that trillions in assets and millions of jobs would be at the mercy of Congress and the bureaucracy, all for greenhouse gas reductions that would have a meaningless impact on global carbon emissions if China and India don't participate. And only somewhat less meaningless if they do. 
Warner-Lieberman has no chance of becoming law this year with President Bush in the White House. But the goal of this Senate exercise is political -- to get Members on the record early, preferably before the burdens of cap and trade become more widely understood; to give Democrats a campaign issue; and to pour the legislative foundation that the next Administration could cite as it attempts to regulate carbon limits while waiting for Congress to act. 
So by all means let's have this debate amid $4 gasoline, and not only on C-Span. If Americans are going to cede this much power to the political class, they at least ought to do it knowing the price they will pay.

Abstract 
The U.S. is at a "tipping point," with people beginning to factor energy use into everyday decisions, says Lee Schipper, who has studied energy consumption for decades, earlier for Royal Dutch Shell PLC and now as a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. Two of the country's biggest environmental- advocacy groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have recently sponsored studies supporting congressional proposals to slap industry with a cap on global-warming emissions -- a cap whose costs industry would almost certainly pass on to consumers. 

Full text 
Gasoline consumption is down. Hybrid-car sales are up. Wal-Mart is selling millions of squiggly energy-efficient light bulbs. Proof of a new wave of environmental consciousness? 
For all the talk about global warming, what is prompting Americans to rein in their fossil-fuel use isn't the effect of their consumption on the planet. It is the effect on their pocketbooks. 
The U.S. is at a "tipping point," with people beginning to factor energy use into everyday decisions, says Lee Schipper, who has studied energy consumption for decades, earlier for Royal Dutch Shell PLC and now as a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley. But the driver isn't ecology, he says. "Sadly, it's economics. No pain, no gain." 
The distinction between Americans' environmental and economic motives has important implications. It suggests that if energy prices fall again, as they did after the 1970s energy crisis, U.S. consumers might well return to sport-utility vehicles as fast as they are now trading down to smaller cars. 
Of course, there is reason to think today's energy prices will remain higher than in the past. The short-term energy shock of the 1970s followed the Arab oil embargo, a supply constraint. Today's price pressure stems from what seems a longer-term trend: rising energy demand, particularly in the developing world. 
But high energy prices alone don't guarantee an environmental revolution. One reason is that, in most cases, alternatives still are more expensive than fossil fuel. Many Americans don't want to pay that premium; many others can't afford to. 
When electric utilities ask consumers whether they would be willing to pay more for power from renewable sources like the wind and sun, more than half the respondents typically say yes. The average participation rate in utilities' optional "green" energy programs: about 2%, according to the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 
"Everybody calls themselves environmentalists," says Jeff Swenerton, a spokesman for the Center for Resource Solutions, a nonprofit group that advocates renewable-energy use. "But when it comes down to spending a bit more for these things, people just don't do it." 
Wal-Mart, long criticized by environmentalists for promoting sprawling real-estate development, lately has become an environmental darling for a series of moves to save energy. Yet Wal-Mart's chief executive, Lee Scott, says there are limits to the company's environmental push -- because many of Wal-Mart's customers live paycheck-to­paycheck, unable to pay extra for chemical-free soap or organic-cotton T-shirts. "It's not a matter that they don't care about sustainability," he says. "It's a matter that they can't afford to pay more." 
Another reason high energy prices don't ensure environmental progress: They often induce shifts to dirtier alternatives. Canada is squeezing oil from its tar sands -- a process so difficult and expensive that only high oil prices make it worthwhile. The effort is so energy-intensive that it produces massive amounts of greenhouse gases. In the U.S., there's new interest in turning cheaper domestic coal into synthetic gasoline -- another process that emits huge quantities of global-warming gases. 
Now the economics are beginning to argue for less-consumptive behavior. The cost of driving a mile in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2002 and 2007 -- a steeper jump than in any six-year period since at least 1960, calculates Mr. Schipper at Berkeley. Last year, he adds, about 5.7% of the average U.S. household's spending went to gasoline -- a level not seen since 1983, around the time when oil prices entered sustained lows that launched the SUV era. "The tipping point is in the budget share" that the average U.S. family is now burning on the road, he says. 
The environmental movement is sensitive to the potential economic squeeze of going green. Two of the country's biggest environmental- advocacy groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have recently sponsored studies supporting congressional proposals to slap industry with a cap on global-warming emissions -- a cap whose costs industry would almost certainly pass on to consumers. The studies' main argument: The caps wouldn't cost the economy too much. 
Fred Krupp, the Environmental Defense Fund's president, has written a new book popularizing the call for a U.S. emissions cap. His book, "Earth: The Sequel," argues that curbing global warming can make Americans rich. It "will build the new industries, jobs, and fortunes of the 21st century," says the book, which Mr. Krupp co-wrote with Miriam Horn. That bottom-line boosterism is a far cry from the ecological appeal of, say, "Silent Spring," the 1962 book widely seen as helping launch the modern environmental movement. 
For years, conservation has depended on economic pressure. Take Europe, where the average resident consumes less than half as much oil each year as the average American. It's not that Europeans are more environmentally minded than Americans -- it is that European governments for decades have hit consumers with high energy taxes, making conservation rational and not just virtuous. 
What would happen to Americans' newfound energy consciousness if the price of a gallon of gasoline fell back to $1.50 tomorrow from its current average of about $3.93? "People would say the crisis is over and generally move back to their previous ways," says Arthur O'Donnell, the Center for Resource Solutions' executive director. "I hate to be cynical, but that's what I think."

Abstract 
The Major Economies Process, launched by the president last year, brings together countries representing some 80% of the world's economic output, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions -- in pursuit of key elements for a new international agreement on climate change. 

Full Text 
Between the two of us, we've served the last five presidents. We join together in the belief that America has to end its addiction to oil, and find a global solution to climate change. Success will require revolutionary efforts from the public and private sectors. 
As prices soar, oil imports add more than $1 billion a day to our trade deficit. There is also a security cost: The tight supply increases our vulnerability to disruptions by terrorists or other causes that could send prices even higher. On top of all this, oil is a leading source of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
There's a better way. 
At the U.S.-sponsored Washington International Renewable Energy Conference in March, we saw that government and industry have exciting new opportunities to create national energy systems powered by clean technologies. 
President Bush addressed the conference, praising the 8,000 international participants as "pioneers on the frontiers of change." He also toured the trade show, during which we joined him in examining Jim's next-generation plug-in hybrid Prius (with its bumper sticker "Bin Laden Hates This Car"). The range of hardware and know-how displayed at that conference should give all of us great hope. 
Consider: Plug-in hybrid vehicles will be in dealers' showrooms in the next two-three years for American families to purchase -- thanks to investments from automakers, federal spending, and new tax incentives. Plug-in hybrids can be recharged at a regular electrical outlet and achieve, overall, more than 100 miles per gallon. At current gas prices, they cost about one-fifth as much to operate as conventional cars. 
Plug-in hybrids can and should also be able to run on various combinations of ethanol, methanol, butanol and other second-generation biofuels produced from sustainable renewable sources such as agricultural and forest waste products, and grasses. These advanced biofuels will reduce concerns about competition between food and fuel. And compared with gasoline, these biofuels may cut carbon emissions by up to 86%. 
For example, a plug-in burning E-85 (85% ethanol) when it needs liquid fuel can get up to 500 miles more per gallon of fossil fuel. A billion dollars of federal investment and new federal mandates, strengthened by the joint action of the Bush administration and Congress, are boosting advanced biofuels. Growing commitments of venture capital are validating their commercial promise. 
We'll also need to change the way we produce electricity for American families and businesses. The federal government and leading U.S. companies must increase their support for renewable energy and low-carbon advanced nuclear technologies, and also for the development of new coal-fired power plants that sequester carbon and thus emit few or no greenhouse gases. Wind-generated electricity is now among the fastest growing U.S. industries, having increased by more than 400% since 2000. 
These new ways to produce and use energy are the beginning of a clean technology revolution, one that will allow us to sever the linkage between economic growth and fossil fuels. 
The global economy has changed dramatically over the past 20 years; and major emerging economies must also join the effort to slow, stop and eventually reverse the growth of emissions. We'll need to respect that national capabilities and circumstances vary, so we must work out a coherent way for each nation to determine the best way to reach the goals we each set. 
The Major Economies Process, launched by the president last year, brings together countries representing some 80% of the world's economic output, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions -- in pursuit of key elements for a new international agreement on climate change. Leaders of major economies will meet this summer to finalize plans. 
The U.S. government and cutting-edge American companies deserve credit for elevating our country's commitment to a new energy system. These efforts can quickly move us toward greater security and reduced climate changing-emissions. But much more needs to be done. 
The coming years will determine whether we continue down the path of oil dependency and rising climate risks, or break our addiction and realize the promise of a clean and prosperous future. 
A clean technology revolution is underway. Only if we work together on both of these goals can we get the job done.

Energy: 
For Exxon Holders, Profit Is Not Enough 
By Russell Gold 
Hundreds of Exxon Mobil Corp. investors will gather Wednesday at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas. Attendees of the annual shareholders meeting should expect Exxon's own Bengal Traders brand coffee, visual displays that tout the company's latest technological breakthroughs -- and a clash between activists and management over the future of the company. 
In some ways, it is an odd time for discontent among the Exxon faithful. With crude-oil prices at record levels, Exxon's stock hit a record high this week. Dividends are up. Profits are unprecedented. 
By these financial measures, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive, should expect to hear a chorus of hosannas from some investors for his recital of the past year's accomplishments. But the activists are focused on the future. They worry Mr. Tillerson isn't preparing enough for what many expect to be a turbulent time in the energy markets. 
The debate on the future of energy isn't academic. Exxon believes that in 2030, just as today, about 60% of the world's energy demand will be met with oil and natural gas. (The rest is largely coal, nuclear and hydropower.) Therefore, the company directs the vast majority of its capital budget to finding, extracting and selling oil and gas. 
Most activists believe governments will soon mandate carbon- emissions constraints in order to curb global warming. This will lead to the swift rise of nonfossil fuels such as wind, solar, nuclear and biomass. 
Exxon faces a raft of shareholder resolutions aimed at both steering the company toward a greener future and forcing change at the top by appointing an independent chairman. 
These votes have been gathering momentum. In 2003, a proxy resolution to split the chairman and chief executives roles received 22% of the vote. Last year, it got 40%. Another proposal, to require Exxon to set specific goals limiting greenhouse-gas emissions, was favored by 31% of shareholders last year. Both are back on Wednesday's ballot. A new proposal would require Exxon to take a hard look at sustainable-energy technologies. 
Offering vocal support to all three measures are descendants of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Exxon-forerunner Standard Oil. Not only are they using their name to draw attention to the resolutions, the family and its retinue have been on the road in recent weeks urging institutional investors to cast their shares in favor of change. Exxon management opposes these resolutions, arguing that its record speaks to its ability to adroitly handle complex energy markets. 
These resolutions are non-binding. If one attracts a majority of votes, Exxon could simply ignore it. But precedence and good corporate governance suggest otherwise. Two years ago, a shareholder resolution calling for the resignation of any Exxon director who doesn't get a majority of votes passed and was subsequently adopted by the board. 
Exxon management might take solace in another shareholder resolution offered this year. The item proposes eliminating nonbinding resolutions altogether because they're "a primary tool of 'activist' or 'nuisance' shareholders." Exxon advises a vote against this measure, stating that suggested change is "the best way to carry out reform of the shareholder proposal process at this time." 
Politics: 
Sen. Clinton's Last Hope 
Rests With Rules Committee 
By June Kronholz When the Democrats last August stripped Florida and Michigan of their delegates to the national convention as penalty for holding an early primary, all sides assumed that a presidential nominee would soon emerge and patch things up with the two vote-rich states. 
It didn't happen that way. That's why a meeting next Saturday of the party's rules and bylaws committee, which has the power to resolve the increasingly ugly dispute, will be the big political event of the week. 
The committee's 30 members can't swing the nomination from one candidate to the other but they can narrow Barack Obama's delegate lead over Hillary Clinton. With no clear path to the nomination left to her, Sen. Clinton's last hope is that the committee gets her close enough to give her renewed credibility with the superdelegates, whose votes still could decide the outcome. It's still a long shot. 
The rules committee normally labors in obscurity. But with 367 delegate seats at stake -- and the Clinton campaign raising political tempers over what it calls disenfranchisement of Florida and Michigan voters -- the party is preparing for overflow seating and bussed-in crowds at the Washington hotel where the committee is meeting. No noisemakers or banners will be allowed, attendees have been warned. 
The committee will be hearing appeals to its no-vote-for-you decision from the Michigan Democratic party and a Florida superdelegate, Jon Ausman. Michigan proposes a split­the-baby solution that gives Sen. Obama 59 of the state's 128 pledged delegates, even though he wasn't on the Jan. 15 primary ballot. That's somewhere between the even split that the Obama campaign favors, and one that gives Sen. Clinton full credit for the 73 delegates she won in the primary with 55% of the popular vote. "Uncommitted" took 40% of the same primary vote. Some Obama backers urged his supporters to cast their ballots that way. 
Mr. Ausman proposes seating half of Florida's pledged delegates, or giving each of them a half vote. Because of the way the party counts things, Sen. Clinton walks away with a dozen more votes if the half- vote plan is used. She got about 50% of the popular vote there, to Sen. Obama's 32%. 
Sen. Obama's interest is in seeing that any compromise costs him as few delegate votes as possible. Sen. Clinton resists compromise at all: She insists that the results of the two primaries stand and all the delegates be seated. 
If her Florida and Michigan victories are recognized by the party, her advisers say, she will approach superdelegates with a dual argument. She leads in the popular vote nationally, she will claim, and she has won the swing states -- including Ohio, Pennsylvania and now Florida and Michigan -- that the Democrats need in November. 
That may not work. The committee may not rule to her liking. It may propose a solution of its own. Or it may wait another month on a ruling. Even then, things may not be over: Either candidate could appeal the ruling to the convention's credentials committee when it meets in Denver in August.

Abstract 
Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University and one of the document's signers, released this humble statement: "Colleges and Universities must lead the effort to reverse global warming for the health and well being of current and future generations." Efforts to accomplish the former include offering free bicycle maintenance, unplugging appliances, using French-fry grease to power campus buses, providing laundry racks for clothes drying and incorporating green principles into new construction. 

Full Text 
On Monday the trustees of the University of Delaware voted to approve a new yearlong residence life program. Undergraduates will be asked, in a reprise of "show and tell," to bring in one of their "favorite material objects" and explain why it is important to them. They will be instructed to discuss intrusive questions like "How do you define love?" and "Who are you voting for" with their dorm-mates. Finally, this extracurricular curriculum will ask students to "pick a metaphor that illustrates their view of sustainability." 
If you have spent any time on a college campus recently, you will realize that "sustainability" is the academy's favorite new buzzword. There's the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE); a Sustainable Endowments Institute that publishes a College Sustainability Report Card; an Ivy Plus Sustainability Working Group, and another one for colleges in the Northeast. There are sustainability offices and officers at dozens of schools nationwide. 
People unfamiliar with this subject might think that sustainability is just a fancy-sounding term for a smattering of environmentally friendly campus activities. But while it's true that the word does encompass recycling and higher-efficiency light bulbs, college administrations in recent years have started to give the term a more dramatic meaning. 
More than 500 schools have signed AASHE's American College and University President Climates Commitment, which sets them on a path toward "climate neutrality." Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University and one of the document's signers, released this humble statement: "Colleges and Universities must lead the effort to reverse global warming for the health and well being of current and future generations." 
According to Lee Bodner, president of EcoAmerica, an organizer of the pledge, the schools have two years to create a comprehensive plan for "eliminating direct emissions" from their campuses and for integrating sustainability into their classrooms. Efforts to accomplish the former include offering free bicycle maintenance, unplugging appliances, using French-fry grease to power campus buses, providing laundry racks for clothes drying and incorporating green principles into new construction. Many schools are also working with local communities to reduce emissions. Oberlin College, Mr. Bodner tells me, has opposed the building of a coal-fired plant near its campus. 
If a school's efforts don't quite measure up, administrations can buy carbon offsets to help. And since academics like to travel to conferences almost as much as Al Gore does, Mr. Bodner and his colleagues have recommended such offsets to balance out all the pollution professors create with airplane fuel. So far the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, is the only school to have achieved "carbon neutrality," buying $25,000 of these indulgences. 
As for the curricular advances, Arizona State has an entire cross- disciplinary program in sustainability. Houston Community College offers training in green building certification. According to Mr. Bodner, students there learn "practical marketable skills that are good for the community." Yale hasn't signed the pledge, but it has publicly promised to reduce its greenhouse gas levels to 10% below their 1990 level by 2020. And it already has 60 courses in which students can study issues of sustainability, according to Julie Newman, the director of the office of sustainability there. Graduate students can get joint degrees in "the environment and business and the environment and divinity school," and Ms. Newman hopes that such opportunities can be expanded to undergraduates soon. 
Academic opportunities aside, Ms. Newman, excitedly touts the ways in which sustainability programs "are becoming part of students' everyday lives." But wait. Are these administrators gushing because students are, say, unplugging their laptops before leaving on winter break? Of course not. 
The sustainability folks have a much bigger agenda. As Mr. Bodner explains: "Sustainability, broadly speaking, is creating the ability for people to live on a planet that can support the population in an environmental way but also ultimately a way that promotes the good life for everyone, for social justice." And Kathleen Kerr, the head of residence life at the University of Delaware, told a gathering of college administrators last fall that the idea that "sustainability is mostly about the environment" is a "myth." In fact, she and a colleague offered a PowerPoint presentation listing other items that administrators might consider in this category. They included "Fair Trade," "Gender Equity," "Affirmative Action," "Multicultural Competence," "Worker's Rights" and "Domestic Partnerships." 
Which brings us back to those Delaware dorms. Thanks to some outside pressure from free-speech-on-campus groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the university's indoctrination schemes at least won't be mandatory. But they probably don't need to be. Students are generally among the most enthusiastic proponents of such nonsense. 
And college administrators couldn't be happier that their young charges have rallied around this cause. After all, as Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars explains, universities have been trying for decades to "create community" on campus. Undergraduates complain that campuses are too balkanized. This is the result, Mr. Wood explains, of the rejection of the administration's in loco parentis role, the rise of research universities and the institution of diversity programs to remind students how different they are from each other. "So administrators thought they could generate community by focusing on some inspiring issue. They turned to the residence life folks and said: 'You have a new mission. You are not supposed to just make students safe and give them a place to study.'" As a result, students have been offered an assortment of rallying cries -­from multiculturalism to sexual empowerment. And now, saving the planet. Over time, though, such fads are hard to sustain.

BEIJING -- The U.S. has asked that China join the International Energy Agency, which was set up after the oil shocks of the 1970s to help developed countries manage emergency oil supplies. 
A U.S. official announced the request Tuesday in Beijing, saying it could bolster the IEA's ability to weather soaring energy prices. The announcement reflects a recognition that without participation from China and India, economic institutions such as the IEA, currently made up largely of the world's richest nations, could become less relevant. 
It also comes at a time of increased concern over China's energy policy in Africa and Central Asia and how it plans to use its own growing fuel stockpiles. 
"China should consider a declaration that it plans to pursue membership in the IEA. This could help ameliorate the anxiety expressed in some quarters over China's intentions as it pursues greater energy security," U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Sullivan said Tuesday at a conference in Beijing. 
Chinese officials say they want to cooperate more closely with the IEA but can't join because the group is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes most of the world's richest countries. The organization says members must be committed to an open market economy and democratic pluralism. 
Communist China's status as a developing country comes into play on issues such as global warming, where it is held to a lower standard than rich countries. 
U.S. officials said the IEA's charter could be rewritten to include China and India, acknowledging their status as developing, but hugely important, countries. 
"From the perspective of an IEA member like the United States, China's participation in the IEA's collective emergency response system would make the system stronger, which will enhance U.S., Chinese, and global energy security," Mr. Sullivan said. 
The IEA has coordinated the release of strategic petroleum reserves only twice since it was founded, once during the first Gulf War in 1990 and then again after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005. One of the biggest obligations for members is to hold 90 days worth of oil imports in strategic petroleum reserves that in theory can be released only in consultation with the other member nations. 
The U.S. is the world's biggest energy consumer and top oil importer, but China will soon surpass Japan as the world's second- biggest oil importer. China's booming economy has nurtured a car- buying frenzy among the growing middle class. International oil futures are nearing $130 a barrel despite White House efforts to persuade the world's biggest producers to pump more crude. 
China is still predominantly dependent on coal. Tuesday, the government warned that coal stockpiles had fallen below warning levels in several regions. This winter, China had devastating blackouts after winter storms hit while stockpiles were low. Power companies are reluctant to buy fuel because the government has capped the prices at which electricity can be sold, despite rising coal prices. 
Despite its growing oil demand, China started building up emergency oil stockpiles only about two years ago, filling up tanks with 33 million barrels of oil, or less than 10 days of imports. Official say they plan to build up to about a month of imports, or about 100 million barrels, but haven't set a timetable for that goal. 
State oil firms are managing the tanks, prompting some to worry that China would use the oil to manipulate markets in its favor. If it joined the IEA, China would pledge to follow international norms and coordinate any release with other members.

Full text 
As the Democratic presidential race unfolds in coal country this week and with John McCain's recent rollout of a global-warming initiative, coal industry officials and environmentalists are unsure which candidate to endorse. 
Unlike the current political cycle, the Bush-Gore and Bush-Kerry contests of 2000 and 2004, respectively, offered a "pretty stark contrast," said Kraig Naasz, chief executive of the National Mining Association, a Washington lobby group. The organization supported Mr. Bush over his rivals, who decried global warming and the environmental damage that results from "mountaintop removal," the common practice of blowing apart peaks to get at the coal underneath. 
With miner support, Mr. Naasz says, Mr. Bush in 2004 was able to capture 10 of 15 counties in Ohio where coal mining is prevalent, and 20 of 28 such counties in West Virginia ­
- votes that may have been crucial to his winning the election. The previous Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, captured a fraction of these counties in 1996. 
Miner support also gave Mr. Bush 22 of 28 coal counties in Pennsylvania (Mr. Dole carried only one of them). Pennsylvania may prove crucial to victory this fall. 
The primary season ends in Montana, the state with the greatest coal reserves, on June 3. Another coal-rich state, Kentucky, holds its primary Tuesday. 
Mr. Naasz, who has personally contributed $1,000 to Sen. McCain's campaign, said the members of his lobby group remain divided over the issue. Campaign-contribution data from OpenSecrets.org show that mining interests have donated $3 million to federal candidates in the current election cycle -- an amount that might double, if past trends are an indicator. Federal records show that Sen. McCain, the likely Republican nominee, has received $59,000 through March from mining interests, while Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have taken in $28,000 and $33,000, respectively. 
Both Democratic candidates have been accused by environmentalists of pandering during the campaign season. During a recent interview with West Virginia Public Radio, Sen. Clinton, of New York, appeared to wobble on mountaintop mining: "You know, maybe there is a way to recover those mountaintops once they have been stripped of the coal. You know, I think we've got to look at this from a practical perspective." 
Sen. Obama, as a senator from coal-producing Illinois, has sided with the industry on certain legislation, such as sponsoring a measure in early 2007 to subsidize coal-to-liquid refineries to make fuel from coal. 
Moreover, Sen. Obama has adopted some of the vocabulary preferred by the coal industry, referring often to so-called "clean coal," a process, still in the research stage, in which carbon from burning coal is sequestered and stored underground. Coal-fired electric plants are believed to be one of the chief causes of global warming. 
"Barack Obama believes in clean Kentucky coal," says a mailer recently sent to voters in that state. The campaign also has released a television ad in Kentucky featuring a coal miner named Randy Henry, who praises Sen. Obama's stance on coal. "Barack understands it," Mr. Henry says. 
Such campaign tactics annoy environmentalists such as Brent Blackwelder, president of a group called Friends of the Earth Action, which is opposed to the use of coal. Though the political arm of his group endorsed Sen. Obama after former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the race, that hasn't stopped the activist from lobbing a few bombs. In a recent news release, Mr. Blackwelder chided Sen. Obama for "parroting" the words of the coal industry. "There's no such thing as 'clean coal,'" he said. 
In an interview, Mr. Blackwelder criticized the Illinois senator for declining to "make any strong statement on mountaintop removal" during recent campaign swings through West Virginia and Kentucky. 
The Obama campaign didn't respond to a request for comment on the coal-region campaigning. 
Complicating the choice this year for miners is Sen. McCain, who has, like the other two candidates, developed a platform to address global warming by creating a cap-and­trade system to reduce carbon emissions. On paper at least, Sen. McCain's carbon-trading plan is far less restrictive than those proposed by Sens. Obama and Clinton. 
What gives mining interests pause is Sen. McCain's failure to cast ballots on five votes over the past year or so. All were related to a major energy bill, a version of which eventually passed. Sens. Clinton and Obama were present for all of the votes. 
An official with the McCain campaign said the Arizona senator was busy campaigning and working on an immigration bill when the votes took place.

Abstract 
Not only do Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to create a national market for permits to discharge greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Companies in danger of exceeding their emissions limit would need to buy extra permits at market prices -- or maybe earn credits by taking steps to reduce carbon output elsewhere. 

Full Text 
TEN YEARS ago, anyone advocating a national system of trading greenhouse-gas emission rights would have seemed like a zealot on the fringe, with no idea of what the American business community could tolerate. 
Times sure have changed. 
Such proposals have entered the political mainstream. Not only do Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to create a national market for permits to discharge greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. So does John McCain, the likely Republican nominee. 
This week, Mr. McCain endorsed the view that such trading arrangements could nudge companies to cut emissions substantially over the next 40 years. That contrasts sharply with President Bush's stance; he opposes legislating a "carbon market." 
Just as importantly -- but with much less fanfare -- many business leaders in the U.S. have decided that a well-constructed carbon market might be the way to go. There's lots of debate about the details and concern about the perils of a badly designed system. But for many executives, an idea that once seemed preposterous or menacing now looks intriguing. 
"A lot of American industry has progressed in its thinking on these issues," says Steven Leer, chairman and chief executive of Arch Coal. He welcomes U.S. initiatives to control carbon emissions, as long as they are tied to overall energy security and eventually are matched by similar efforts world-wide. 
Executives' new open-mindedness can be tied in part to the changing scientific landscape. Evidence has piled up in recent years tying increased industrial production of carbon dioxide to global warming. The debate isn't totally over, but the connection appears strong enough for executives such as Mr. Leer to declare: "Go ahead. Let's get on with it." 
MEANWHILE, PLENTY of companies have refined or retooled their business models so they can profit from the emergence of a "green economy." At The Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference in March, companies as diverse as Procter & Gamble and Duke Energy talked about ways they are positioning themselves as environmentally friendly. 
Areas like solar energy and clean-coal technology are booming. Even approaches that aren't profitable yet are being nursed along by a flurry of venture-capital investing and government subsidies. 
Most proposals for a carbon market would set nationwide caps on carbon-dioxide emissions, which would be gradually reduced, year by year. Companies would get a fixed number of annual emission permits, based on their energy output. 
A "cap and trade" market would then ensue. Companies with more permits than they needed could sell them at a profit. Companies in danger of exceeding their emissions limit would need to buy extra permits at market prices -- or maybe earn credits by taking steps to reduce carbon output elsewhere. 
For electric utilities that rely on relatively clean sources of power, a cap-and-trade system could be a bonanza, letting them raise money by selling unneeded permits. Calpine, which runs natural-gas- fired plants, told investors earlier this year its gross margins would improve if Congress passed greenhouse-gas legislation. 
Utilities that rely mostly on coal-fired plants would like to get a free allotment of permits at the start, so their costs don't go up. Those that generate lots of nuclear power would rather have the government charge for permits, making life tougher for their competitors. 
OF COURSE, in setting up a cap-and-trade system, the devil is in the details. The European Union has been operating a carbon market since April 2005, with mixed results. It issued lots of free emissions permits to utilities, making the program palatable. But that's meant the permits have sometimes traded at such low prices that buyers weren't motivated to look for other ways to cut emissions. 
Nor have business skeptics vanished. The National Association of Manufacturers issued a study in March, asserting that a greenhouse-gas bill drafted by Sens. Joseph Lieberman and John Warner could reduce economic output, cost jobs and contribute to rising electricity and gasoline prices. But NAM's study appears to have been based on shaky assumptions, predicting that retail gasoline prices would be an inflation-adjusted $2.13 a gallon in 2020 without the bill, and as much as $3.59 with it. Thanks to a surge in oil prices, gasoline already has shot up to about $3.70 a gallon. 
Such runaway energy prices contribute to the willingness to consider more-aggressive steps to reshape U.S. energy consumption. 
At Chevron, Andrew Mingst manages the oil giant's carbon-market activity. The company trades regularly in the European carbon market and is seeking carbon-offset allowances through the United Nations for a geothermal project in Indonesia that generates clean energy. 
Mr. Mingst expects new carbon markets to emerge in Australia and Canada, perhaps before a U.S. market takes shape. "This is a big area that could get a lot bigger," he says. 
In fact, Chevron would like to see carbon markets gain the ability to trade contracts reaching as far as 10 years in the future. That way, Mr. Mingst says, energy companies could make long-term decisions with confidence about how to build or refit refineries and other projects.

McCain's Climate 'Market'

Full Text 
The latest stop on John McCain's policy tour came at an Oregon wind- turbine manufacturer, where the topic was -- what else? -- the Senator's plan to address climate change. This is one of those issues where Mr. McCain indulges his "maverick" tendencies, which usually means taking the liberal line. That was the case yesterday, no matter how frequently he claimed his approach was "market based." 
In fact, if "the market" is your favored mechanism, Mr. McCain's endorsement of a "cap and trade" system is the worst choice for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The Bush Administration has pursued one option, which combines voluntary measures with subsidies for "clean" alternatives. Since 2001 under this approach, U.S. net carbon emissions have fallen by 3% -- that is, by more than all but four countries in cap-and-trade-bound Europe. 
At the other end of the market spectrum is a straight carbon tax, which would at least distribute costs more efficiently. It would also force politicians to be honest about -- and take responsibility for -- the true price of their global-warming posturing. 
Then there's cap and trade, which Mr. McCain has backed for years and would, as he put it with some understatement, "change the dynamic of our energy economy." He noted that Americans have a genius for problem-solving but continued, "The federal government can't just summon these talents by command -- only the free market can draw them out." To translate: His plan is "market based" insofar as it requires an expensive, invasive government bureaucracy to interfere with the market. 
Mr. McCain's proposed targets and policy instruments more or less mesh with the global-warming bill sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner that may come up for debate next month. The McCain plan would aim to return emissions to 2005 levels by 2012, and to 1990 levels by 2020. Barack Obama supports similar reductions. 
In theory, this would be achieved by imposing emission ceilings on electric power, transportation fuels, commercial business and industries. If a company produced less carbon than it was allowed under the cap, it could sell -- i.e., trade -- its extra allowances to other businesses. Under the McCain plan, permits would be given away to industries, at least initially. Mr. Obama prefers to "auction" the permits, meaning businesses would be taxed at the outset. So Mr. McCain's plan would help mitigate the transition costs of putting "the age of fossil fuels behind us." 
The problem is that once government creates an artificial scarcity of carbon, how the credits are allocated creates a huge new venue for political rent-seeking and more subsidies for favored industries. Some businesses will benefit more than others, in proportion to their lobbying influence and how well they're able to game the Beltway. Congress itself will probably take the largest revenue grab, offering itself a few more bites out of the economy and soaking politically unpopular businesses. 
Then there's the question of whether any of this will even reduce greenhouse gasses. The McCain plan would allow businesses unlimited use of domestic and international offsets to comply with the carbon cap. So a chemical manufacturer, say, would pay an industry not covered by the program -- most notably, agriculture -- to reduce its emissions. Or it could pay a coal plant in China for plucking low- hanging efficiency fruit, like installing smokestack scrubbers. In other words, U.S. consumers would be paying higher prices for energy in return for making Chinese industries more efficient and competitive. Europe is in the midst of that experience now under the Kyoto Protocol, and most of its reductions so far have been illusory. 
The compliance bookkeeping for this new "market" is vastly complex, and a McCain Administration would create a public-private "Climate Change Credit Corporation" to oversee it all. This new regulatory body is likely to morph over time into an "Energy Fed," similar to the one Warner-Lieberman would create. Such an agency would set the price of energy indirectly by fiddling with carbon levies, which will undoubtedly lead to economy-wide distortions. 
Given the distance between Mr. McCain's rhetoric and the policy reality, we wonder if he even knows what he's proposing. This is of a piece with his approach to many domestic issues, where the policy contradictions and cul-de-sacs overwhelm his professed political convictions. The McCain campaign believes his global-warming plan will appeal to independents and young people, as well as separate the Senator from President Bush. 
But he will never be green enough for the climate-change fundamentalists. The Obama campaign and Democrats were already dinging Mr. McCain yesterday for half-measures. His concessions won't help him much in November, but they will make his governing decisions in 2009 that much more difficult if by some chance he does win.

New Wave of Nuclear Plants Faces High Costs

Abstract 
Estimates released in recent weeks by experienced nuclear operators -- NRG Energy Inc., Progress Energy Inc., Exelon Corp., Southern Co. and FPL Group Inc. -- "have blown by our highest estimate" of costs computed just eight months ago, said Jim Hempstead, a senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service credit-rating agency in New York. It has picked a reactor design by Westinghouse Electric Co., a unit of Toshiba Corp., after concluding it could cost as much as $12 billion to build plants with reactors designed by General Electric Co. The joint venture GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy said it hasn't seen FPL's calculations but is confident its units "are cost-competitive compared with other nuclear designs." 

Full Text 
A new generation of nuclear power plants is on the drawing boards in the U.S., but the projected cost is causing some sticker shock: $5 billion to $12 billion a plant, double to quadruple earlier rough estimates. 
Nuclear power is regaining favor as an alternative to other sources of power generation, such as coal-fired plants, which have fallen out of favor because they are major polluters. But the high cost could lead to sharply higher electricity bills for consumers and inevitably reignite debate about the nuclear industry's suitability to meet growing energy needs. 
Nuclear plants haven't been built in meaningful numbers in the U.S. since the 1980s. Part of the cost escalation is bad luck. Plants are being proposed in a period of skyrocketing costs for commodities such as cement, steel and copper; amid a growing shortage of skilled labor; and against the backdrop of a shrunken supplier network for the industry. 
The price escalation is sobering because the industry and regulators have worked hard to make development more efficient, in hopes of eliminating problems that in the past produced harrowing cost overruns. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for example, has created a streamlined licensing process to make timelier, more comprehensive decisions about proposals. Nuclear vendors have developed standardized designs for plants to reduce construction and operating costs. And utility executives, with years of operating experience behind them, are more astute buyers. 
Now, 104 nuclear reactors are operating in the U.S. Most are highly profitable but that was not the case until fairly recently. For the 75 units built between 1966 and 1986, the average cost was $3 billion or triple early estimates, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many plants operate profitably now because they were sold to current operators for less than their actual cost. 
The latest projections follow months of tough negotiations between utility companies and key suppliers, and suggest efforts to control costs are proving elusive. Estimates released in recent weeks by experienced nuclear operators -- NRG Energy Inc., Progress Energy Inc., Exelon Corp., Southern Co. and FPL Group Inc. -- "have blown by our highest estimate" of costs computed just eight months ago, said Jim Hempstead, a senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service credit-rating agency in New York. 
Moody's worries that continued cost increases, even if partially offset by billions of dollars worth of federal subsidies, could weaken companies and expose consumers to high energy costs. 
On May 7, Georgia Power Co., a unit of Atlanta-based Southern, said it expects to spend $6.4 billion for a 45.7% interest in two new reactors proposed for the Vogtle nuclear plant site near Augusta, Ga. Utility officials declined to disclose total costs. A typical Georgia Power household could expect to see its power bill go up by $144 annually to pay for the plants after 2018, the utility said. 
Bill Edge, spokesman for the Georgia Public Service Commission, said Georgia "will look at what's best for ratepayers" and could pull support if costs balloon to frightening heights. The existing Vogtle plant, put into service in the late 1980s, cost more than 10 times its original estimate, roughly $4.5 billion for each of two reactors. 
FPL Group, Juno Beach, Fla., estimates it will cost $6 billion to $9 billion to build each of two reactors at its Turkey Point nuclear site in southeast Florida. It has picked a reactor design by Westinghouse Electric Co., a unit of Toshiba Corp., after concluding it could cost as much as $12 billion to build plants with reactors designed by General Electric Co. The joint venture GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy said it hasn't seen FPL's calculations but is confident its units "are cost-competitive compared with other nuclear designs." 
Exelon, the nation's biggest nuclear operator, is considering building two reactors on an undeveloped site in Texas, and said the cost could be $5 billion to $6.5 billion each. The plants would be operated as "merchant" plants and thus would not have utility customers on the hook to pay for them, as is the case in both Florida and Georgia. Instead, they would have to cover expenses through wholesale power sales. 
Several things could derail new development plans. Excessive cost is one. A second is the development of rival technologies that could again make nuclear plants look like white elephants. A drop in prices for coal and natural gas, now very expensive, also could make nuclear plants less attractive. On the other hand, if Congress decides to tax greenhouse-gas emissions, that could make electricity from nuclear plants more attractive by raising costs for generators that burn fossil fuels. Nuclear plants wouldn't have to pay the charges because they aren't emitters. 
Some states are clearing a path for nuclear-power development, even before costs are fully known. They are inspired by a growing fear of climate change. "The overwhelming feeling in Florida is that nuclear power is popular and that's why it's going to go ahead," said J.R. Kelly, head of the Office of Public Counsel in Tallahassee, which represents consumers. "Our main concern is the tremendous cost." 
In Florida, state officials are allowing utilities to collect money from customers to cover development and construction costs. In the past, regulators typically required utilities to bear the costs until plants were finished. 
Many utilities said they are watching with interest. Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. in New Jersey, said his company may not be big enough to build a nuclear plant, even though it is a nuclear operator. "We're concerned by the rise in construction costs," he said.

Abstract 
Armed with that information, political demographers from both parties have drawn increasingly safe, ideologically homogenous congressional districts when state legislatures back home re-craft those districts after each decade's census. 

Full text 
The long, fascinating spectacle of the presidential primaries has all but obscured their potential impact on American politics: Campaign 2008 may break Washington's gridlock by reviving the long-dormant political center. 
The public's hunger for a change in Washington's ways has formed the backdrop of this year's presidential race from its outset. When the Wall Street Journal and NBC News surveyed voters in December, as the campaign began, almost half agreed that America needed "major reforms and a brand new and different approach" to handling problems. 
In the wake of Tuesday's primary elections in North Carolina and Indiana, it appears more likely than ever that the two presidential candidates this fall will be among those forging a new center: John McCain, Michael Bloomberg, Barack Obama and Arnold Schwarzenegger Sen. Barack Obama for the Democrats and Sen. John McCain for the Republicans. They happen to be the two most surprisingly successful candidates of the year, and both got ahead largely by arguing they have unique abilities to bring people together in Washington. 
Change may be stirring in other areas that have contributed to gridlock. Voters are pulling politicians toward the middle of the ideological spectrum by registering as independents and calling for centrist solutions. A new cast of political players -- some young, most little-known to the nation -- is emerging to show that there are ways to transcend gridlock by reaching across the aisle. 
And a seismic shift has come in the way politicians chase the money they need to win and keep office. A surge in Internet campaign donations by average citizens carries the promise that politicians might become less beholden to special interests on the right or left. Raising more money via the Internet instead of on the hustings may even leave politicians more time to spend in Washington, talking to each other. 
To understand why there is a chance for change, it's necessary to first look at how Pennsylvania Avenue, the closest thing America has to a national Main Street, became a street divided in the first place. 
A principal factor in Washington's dysfunction has been the steady decline of the political center. Forty years ago, conservative Southern Democrats and liberal Northeastern Republicans filled up the middle of the political spectrum, forming a kind of human bridge between the partisan extremes. Now many of those conservative Southern Democrats have become Republicans, and those liberal Northeastern Republicans have nearly been wiped out. The center is a much lonelier place. 
The art and science of modern politics have made the divisions wider. Computer software allows politicians to pinpoint, house by house, the voting tendencies of particular neighbors. Armed with that information, political demographers from both parties have drawn increasingly safe, ideologically homogenous congressional districts when state legislatures back home re-craft those districts after each decade's census. Instead of voters choosing their lawmakers, Republican Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia says, lawmakers are choosing their voters. 
Thus, conservative lawmakers can speak largely to fellow conservatives when they are trying to get re-elected, liberals to fellow liberals, minorities to fellow minorities. Media-world changes, meanwhile, have produced a 24-hour news cycle increasingly filled by niche outlets that speak only to partisans of one side or the other. 
That has all made it safer for members of Congress to remain highly partisan. In 2002 and 2004, for example, not a single seat in California's 53-member congressional delegation changed partisan hands. Even in 2006 -- during what was seen as a political earthquake, when Democrats took control of both the House and the Senate from Republicans -- only a single incumbent lost his seat in California. 
As the two parties have moved further apart on the ideological spectrum, they also have divided power almost evenly. Republicans now control the White House and Democrats Congress, of course. But even within Congress, neither party is really in charge. Democratic control of the Senate hangs on the cooperation of independent Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a former Democrat who increasingly votes with the Republicans. That could end with this election, if Republicans' current low standing in polls translates into Democratic victories in the White House and Congress. 
But for now, power in Washington is so evenly divided that nobody has enough control either to paper over differences or to roll past them. Karl Rove, President Bush's political maestro, looks at the state of the long struggle between Democrats and Republicans for clear control and concludes: "This is like two boxers fighting to the point of exhaustion." 
A big reason for partisan paralysis is the lust for campaign contributions that drives lawmakers out of Washington -- and into the arms of ideologically opposed special interests -- to raise money as soon as their legislative week is over. 
That, in turn, means fewer lawmakers from opposing sides actually live in Washington, where they and their families might get better acquainted and engage in the natural human inclination to compromise with a friend. Rep. John Dingell, a powerful Democrat who has served in the House for half a century, and whose father served there before him, recalls that when he first came to Washington the only way to arrive was to endure a 12-hour train ride from Michigan. The commute was too painful to undertake very often. 
Instead, the whole Michigan delegation lived in Washington, where the members -- Republican and Democrat -- became well acquainted. Now members flee Washington as soon as their business is done for the week. While that may help tie lawmakers to their districts more closely, it doesn't help get things done in Washington. "People now don't know each other," Mr. Dingell says simply. 
So the question of this campaign year is: Which of these forces of gridlock might be changing? 
There is no immediate change in sight in the media, or in the process of drawing congressional districts. The campaign debate suggests significant and fractious differences persist on items such as tax cuts. But on the other fronts, change may well be brewing. 
Sens. McCain and Obama explicitly base their appeals to voters on the premise that they can reach out both to independent voters who are affiliated with neither party, and to politicians of the opposite party. A precedent for such a governing style recently has been set: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York have led the way, each succeeding largely by detaching themselves from their Republican party and governing as independents. 
Voters are pushing the system in precisely this direction: The share of the public registered as neither Democrat nor Republican, but rather as independent, has exploded in recent years. In New Hampshire this year, more than four in 10 registered voters didn't declare any party affiliation, up from just more than two in 10 in 1992. In California, independent voters are the fastest-growing segment of those who have registered; almost a quarter of the registered voters there now are either independent or affiliated with neither major party. 
Some political players are responding to this urge to transcend party barriers. Consider 32-year-old Mara Vanderslice, whose life work is to help Democrats get more comfortable talking about religion and values. She pursued that cause for the campaigns of Howard Dean and Sen. John Kerry in 2004. Then she co-founded a firm called Common Good Strategies and worked for seven Democratic candidates in six states in the 2006 congressional elections, trying to help them connect with religious voters. All won. 
Ms. Vanderslice is part of a new wave of younger activists willing to reach across party lines for the causes they advocate. She has, for example, pushed legislation sponsored by a pro-life Democrat and a pro-choice Republican designed to reduce abortions by increasing support for family-planning programs (something Democrats like), and by increasing assistance for women who choose to keep their babies (something Republicans like). That puts her in the vanguard of like- minded activists who are starting to reshape the values debate. "There is a kind of informal network of about twenty of us, all about the same age, trying to find our voice on these issues," she says. 
Her analog on the Republican side may well be Pete Wehner, 47 years old, a genial social conservative who worked for Mr. Rove in the Bush White House. Mr. Wehner, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, sees "a huge change going on among Christian conservatives, especially those in their twenties and thirties." He says they're moving "away from issues like abortion and toward social issues, social justice and aid to Africa, for example." Those are issues where they are more likely to find common ground with Democrats. Indeed, the role model for many young Christian conservatives is no longer Pat Robertson, Mr. Wehner says, but rock star Bono, the crusader for aid to Africa's poor. 
The non-stop search for campaign cash has long driven politicians toward special-interest groups at one end of the political spectrum or the other. But the Internet has ushered in a whole new way to raise significant amounts of campaign contributions from a much broader range of average Americans. Sen. Obama's campaign has led the way: It raised $40 million in March alone, largely by tapping its Internet- driven base of nearly 1.5 million donors, whose average contribution was $96. 
But Sen. Obama isn't alone. After Sen. Hillary Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary in late April, she asked in her victory speech that supporters go to her Web site and donate. The money started rolling in that night, and more than $2.5 million had arrived before midnight, her campaign says. 
This new, mass-market campaign-finance game could increase the power of average voters and decrease the influence of special-interest groups that pull politicians toward extremes. And by proving the Internet is the best fund-raising vehicle around, a new finance pattern could change the dynamics in other ways -- including reducing the need of politicians to spend time away from Washington raising money. 
Rep. Jim McCrery, top Republican on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, can attest to the changing power of getting to know colleagues in Washington better. For the first 14 years of his service in Congress, the former lawyer and paper-company executive commuted regularly to Washington from his home district in Louisiana. Then he moved his family to the Washington suburbs -- and ended up in the same neighborhood as Democratic Rep. Chet Edwards of Texas, a colleague he hardly knew. 
Their sons joined the same Boy Scout Troop -- and changed the lawmakers' relationship. In 2004, Rep. McCrery had sent $10,000 from his personal political-action committee to help in the GOP effort to defeat Rep. Edwards. By 2006, after his move, Rep. McCrery decided he wouldn't donate money to go after his neighbor's job. "When you get to know somebody as a neighbor, or your kids play together on the soccer team, it's harder for you to go on the floor and call them names," Rep. McCrery says. 
Business and labor organizations, equally frustrated with Washington's problems, also are fueling the drive for new and more bipartisan ways of doing business. In the twilight phase of the Bush term, some have started linking arms to find solutions. 
Last year, General Electric Co., Duke Power and other corporate titans staged a press conference alongside leading environmentalists to call for action against global warming through a national "cap and trade" system to limit carbon emissions. Similarly, in its record- setting $45 billion leveraged buyout of the TXU Corp. energy concern, private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts anticipated and defused environmentalists' opposition in advance. KKR pledged to shut down several high-polluting coal-fired TXU power plants, and in turn the environmentalists agreed not to foment political opposition to the deal. 
Progress on Pennsylvania Avenue increasingly is going to come when such coalitions of "the lions and the lambs" -- that is, interest groups seemingly opposed to each other -­come together, says Bernadette Budde, a strategist at the Business-Industry Political Action Committee known as BiPAC. 
Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union and no-one's idea of a lamb, has reached a similar conclusion from the other side of the labor/management divide. "There's a greater sense of common purpose outside the political system than there is inside the political system," he says. 
Rivals in the labor movement call him arrogant, egocentric, and power-hungry, but Mr. Stern has been willing to shake up the status quo. "We need a culture of success more than a culture of partisanship," Mr. Stern says. He has teamed up with Wal-Mart Stores Inc's chief executive officer, Lee Scott, to advocate government action in expanding health-care coverage. 
And he has forged a partnership with Beverly Health & Rehabilitation Services, a leading nursing-home chain: The company has allowed union organizers entree to its workers, in return for the union's wielding its clout with several state legislatures to obtain increases in government reimbursements. Mr. Stern's union also is one of two that also have struck confidential agreements with some employers determining where the unions can seek to organize. 
Ultimately, the need to solve some especially daunting problems in the next decade or so may force Washington's rival power centers into united action, much as World War II and the Cold War did in decades past. The two parties' success over previous decades in conquering problems that demanded national consensus -- civil rights, the defeat of the Communist threat, welfare reform -- has pushed the agenda in recent years onto topics where there is less consensus. 
"Both parties, having accomplished the big things that they set out to do, fight over the small things," contends Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the Republican Party. 
But ending the alarming rise in the cost of health care, searching for energy independence in an era of $100-a-barrel oil, and, perhaps above all, resisting the rise of extreme Islam and terrorism all are problems with potential to compel national consensus at some point. "Those are three huge issues, all of which I think are very amenable to 
bipartisan solutions," says Mr. Mehlman, a law-school classmate of Mr. Obama. "At a moment when we have big issues, hopefully we can come together."

Abstract 
Politicians, business titans, academics and environmental activists proudly point to four decades of environmentally conscious public policy -- while maintaining a dynamic economy, arguably the eighth- largest on the planet, with a gross state product of more than $1.6 trillion. Rancho Seco helps explain California's energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, when numerous rolling blackouts and power outages caused billions of dollars in damages. 

Full Text 
'When you look at the globe, California is a little spot on that globe," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said recently at Yale University's Climate Change Conference. "But when it comes to our power of influence, it is the equivalent of a whole continent." 
Perhaps. As an exercise of this influence, Mr. Schwarzenegger has attempted to push climate-change policy forward, signing the Global Warming Solutions Act. It commits the state to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels -- roughly 25% below today's -- and all but eliminating them by 2050. 
"California has the ideas of Athens and the power of Sparta," he said in his state of the state address last year. "Not only can we lead California into the future; we can show the nation and the world how to get there." 
His words are in keeping with the state's self-perception. Politicians, business titans, academics and environmental activists proudly point to four decades of environmentally conscious public policy -- while maintaining a dynamic economy, arguably the eighth- largest on the planet, with a gross state product of more than $1.6 trillion. 
In truth, the state's energy leadership is a mirage. Decades of environmental policies have made it heavily dependent on other states for power; generated crippling costs; and left the state vulnerable to periodic electricity shortages. Its economic growth has occurred not because of, but despite, those policies. 
Since the early 1970s, California has instituted new efficiency standards for appliances and the construction of new buildings. It mandated aggressive conservation programs, and required a certain percentage of the state's electricity to come from renewable sources like wind and solar, it has subsidized. It implemented far-reaching regulations on emissions from car tailpipes and from stationary sources like factories. And it has moved to shut down the state's nuclear facilities. 
For a time, it worked. Since the mid-1970s, California's economy has grown while per-capita energy consumption stayed flat -- an astounding fact, considering that such consumption has increased by roughly 50% elsewhere in the country over the same period. 
But consider the story of the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Opened in 1975, it was capable of generating over 900 megawatts (MW) of electricity, enough to power upward of 900,000 homes. Fourteen years after powering up, the nuclear reactor shut down, thanks to fierce anti-nuclear opposition. Eventually, the facility was converted to solar power, and today generates a measly four MW of electricity. After millions of dollars in subsidies and other support, the entire state has less than 250 MW of solar capacity. 
Rancho Seco helps explain California's energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, when numerous rolling blackouts and power outages caused billions of dollars in damages. The degree to which rapacious power- company executives and traders were responsible for the shortages remains open to debate. Not open to debate is that California had insufficient power to meet demand, with a frayed and overloaded infrastructure for moving electrons. 
California's flat per-capita energy consumption has not saved it from blackouts, either, since its population had been soaring. From 1979 to 1999, the number of residents jumped from about 23 million people to 33 million. Today, the figure is closer to 38 million, and it could top 45 million by 2020. 
The blunt secret is this: California now imports lots of energy from neighboring states to make up for having too few power plants. Up to 20% of the state's power comes from coal-burning plants in Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Montana. Another significant portion comes from large-scale hydropower in Oregon, Washington State and the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas. 
"California practices a sort of energy colonialism," says James Lucier of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C.-area investment group. "They leave those states to deal with the resulting pollution." 
California's proud claim to have kept per-capita energy consumption flat while growing its economy is less impressive than it seems. The state has some of the highest energy prices in the country -- nearly twice the national average -- largely because of regulations and government mandates to use expensive renewable sources of power. As a result, heavy manufacturing and other energy-intensive industries have been fleeing the Golden State in droves. 
The unreliable power grid is starting to rattle some Silicon Valley heavyweights. Intel CEO Craig Barrett, for instance, vowed in 2001 not to build a chip-making facility in California until power supplies became more reliable. This October, Intel opened a $3 billion factory near Phoenix for mass production of its new 45-nanometer microprocessors. Google has chosen to build the massive server farms that will fuel its expansion anywhere but in California. 
And yet, despite a desperate need for more power, opposition to energy projects remains prevalent. State law prohibits the construction of new nuclear plants, and legislative efforts last summer to repeal it went nowhere. Last spring state regulators vetoed a proposal to build a liquefied natural gas terminal 14 miles off the Malibu coast. 
Even renewable energy projects meet resistance. Texas, of all places, is the nation's leader in wind-power generation. High costs, excessive regulation and environmentalist litigation have hampered California's efforts. Texas has just built lots of turbines. 
None of this has stopped leaders from setting wildly unrealistic goals for safeguarding the environment, from electric cars to wind- energy production. The latest goal is to drastically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The details of how the Global Warming Solutions Act is actually implemented don't have to be revealed until next January. Even the California Energy Commission hints that the targets might be unreachable. But they'll certainly cost a lot to find out. Analysis from the Electric Power Research Institute pegs the Act's cost to the California economy at anywhere from $100 billion to $511 billion. 
Californians may feel good about their environmental consciousness. But someone needs to build power plants and oil refineries to fuel their economy. Someone needs to manufacture the cars they drive, the airplanes they fly, the chemicals and resins and paints and plastics that make their lives comfortable. 
Those things require energy, and lots of it. All the wisdom of Athens and all the power of Sparta won't change that fact.

Abstract 
According to the Department of Energy's most recent data on greenhouse gas emissions, in 2006 the U.S. emitted 5.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, or just under 20 tons per capita. The Energy Department breaks down emissions into residential, commercial (office buildings, etc.), industrial, and transportation (planes, trains and automobiles); electricity consumption is apportioned to each. 

Full Text 
The usual chorus of environmentalists and editorial writers has chimed in to attack President Bush's recent speech on climate change. In his address of April 23, he put forth a goal of stopping the growth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025. 
"Way too little and way too late," runs the refrain, followed by the claim that nothing less than an 80% reduction in emissions by the year 2050 will suffice -- what I call the "80 by 50" target. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have endorsed it. John McCain is not far behind, calling for a 65% reduction. 
We all ought to reflect on what an 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050 really means. When we do, it becomes clear that the president's target has one overwhelming virtue: Assuming emissions curbs are even necessary, his goal is at least realistic. 
The same cannot be said for the carbon emissions targets espoused by the three presidential candidates and environmentalists. Indeed, these targets would send us back to emissions levels last witnessed when the cotton gin was in daily use. 
Begin with the current inventory of carbon dioxide emissions -- CO2 being the principal greenhouse gas generated almost entirely by energy use. According to the Department of Energy's most recent data on greenhouse gas emissions, in 2006 the U.S. emitted 5.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, or just under 20 tons per capita. An 80% reduction in these emissions from 1990 levels means that the U.S. cannot emit more than about one billion metric tons of CO2 in 2050. 
Were man-made carbon dioxide emissions in this country ever that low? The answer is probably yes -- from historical energy data it is possible to estimate that the U.S. last emitted one billion metric tons around 1910. But in 1910, the U.S. had 92 million people, and per capita income, in current dollars, was about $6,000. 
By the year 2050, the Census Bureau projects that our population will be around 420 million. This means per capita emissions will have to fall to about 2.5 tons in order to meet the goal of 80% reduction. 
It is likely that U.S. per capita emissions were never that low -- even back in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood. The only nations in the world today that emit at this low level are all poor developing nations, such as Belize, Mauritius, Jordan, Haiti and Somalia. 
If that comparison seems unfair, consider that even the least-CO2 emitting industrialized nations do not come close to the 2050 target. France and Switzerland, compact nations that generate almost all of their electricity from nonfossil fuel sources (nuclear for France, hydro for Switzerland) emit about 6.5 metric tons of CO2 per capita. 
The daunting task of reaching one billion metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2050 comes into even greater relief when we look at the American economy, sector-by-sector. The Energy Department breaks down emissions into residential, commercial (office buildings, etc.), industrial, and transportation (planes, trains and automobiles); electricity consumption is apportioned to each. 
Consider the residential sector. At the present time, American households emit 1.2 billion tons of CO2 -- 20% higher than the entire nation's emissions must be in 2050. If households are to emit no more than their present share of CO2, emissions will have to be reduced to 204 million tons by 2050. But in 2050, there will be another 40 million residential households in the U.S. 
Today, the average residence in the U.S. uses about 10,500 kilowatt hours of electricity and emits 11.4 tons of CO2 per year (much more if you are Al Gore or John Edwards and live in a mansion). To stay within the magic number, average household emissions will have to fall to no more than 1.5 tons per year. In our current electricity infrastructure, this would mean using no more than about 2,500 KwH per year. This is not enough juice to run the average hot water heater. 
You can forget refrigerators, microwaves, clothes dryers and flat screen TVs. Even a house tricked out with all the latest high- efficiency EnergyStar appliances and compact fluorescent lights won't come close. The same daunting energy math applies to the industrial, commercial and transportation sectors as well. The clear implication is that we shall have to replace virtually the entire fossil fuel electricity infrastructure over the next four decades with CO2-free sources -- a multi-trillion dollar proposition, if it can be done at all. 
Natural gas -- the preferred coal substitute of the moment -- won't come close. If we replaced every single existing coal plant with a natural gas plant, CO2 emissions from electric power generation alone would still be more than twice the 2050 target. Most environmentalists remain opposed to nuclear power, of course. It is unlikely that renewables -- wind, solar, and biomass -- can ever make up more than about 20% of our electricity supply. 
Suppose, however, that a breakthrough in carbon sequestration, a revival of nuclear power, and a significant improvement in the cost and effectiveness of renewables were to enable us to reduce the carbon footprint of electricity production. That would still leave transportation. 
Right now our cars and trucks consume about 180 billion gallons of motor fuel. To meet the 2050 target, we shall have to limit consumption of gasoline to about 31 billion gallons, unless a genuine carbon-neutral liquid fuel can be produced. (Ethanol isn't it.) To show how unrealistic this is, if the entire nation drove nothing but Toyota Priuses in 2050, we'd still overshoot the transportation emissions target by 40%. 
The enthusiasm for an 80% reduction target is often justified on grounds that national policy should set an ambitious goal. However, claims on behalf of alternative energy sources -- biofuels, hydrogen, windpower and so forth -- either do not match up to the scale of the energy required, or are not cost-competitive in current form. 
How on God's green earth will we make up the difference? Someone should put this question to the candidates. And not let them slide past it with glittering generalities.

Abstract 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has worked to detail the scientific bases of this problem and the Kyoto agreement sought to encourage countries to take steps to reduce their greenhouse emissions. 

Full Text 
Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Major greenhouse gases in the air are accumulating faster than in the past, despite efforts to curtail their growth. Carbon-dioxide concentration in the air increased by 2.4 parts per million last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday, and methane 
concentrations also rose rapidly. Global concentration of carbon dioxide is now nearly 385 parts per million. 
Concern has grown in recent years about these gases, with most atmospheric scientists concerned that the increasing accumulation is causing the earth's temperature to rise, 
potentially disrupting climate and changing patterns of rainfall, drought and other storms. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has worked to detail the scientific bases of this problem and the Kyoto agreement sought to encourage countries to take steps 

to reduce their greenhouse emissions. Some countries, particularly in Europe, have taken steps to reduce emissions. 
But carbon-dioxide emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, have continued to increase. 
Since 2000, annual increases of two parts per million or more have been common, compared with 1.5 parts per million per year in the 1980s and less than one part per million 

per year during the 1960s, NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory said. 
Preindustrial carbon-dioxide levels hovered around 280 parts per million until 1850. Human activities pushed those levels up to 380 parts per million by early 2006. 
Rapidly growing industrialization in Asia and rising wetland emissions in the Arctic and tropics are the most likely causes of the recent methane increase, said Ed Dlugokencky 

from NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory. 
Methane in the atmosphere rose by 27 million tons last year after nearly a decade with little or no increase, he said. 
Methane is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but there is far less of it in the atmosphere. When related climate affects are taken into account, 

methane's overall climate impact is nearly half that of carbon dioxide.

The Wall Street Journal Online 
The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here. 
Hillary Clinton got the Pennsylvania primary victory she needed to keep her campaign alive but not enough of a triumph to significantly improve her chances of prevailing over Barack Obama, even if exit polls portrayed a populace more divided than Mr. Obama likes to describe it. 
With 99% of the votes tallied, Sen. Clinton was ahead 55% to 45%, earning her at least 66 of the state's 158 delegates to the Democratic convention, and Sen. Obama 57, by the Associated Press's count. That still leaves Mr. Obama far ahead in the delegate race, with 1,705 to Mrs. Clinton's 1,575, according to the AP. But it gave Mrs. Clinton another chance to persuade the party superdelegates needed to decide the nomination that she's an underdog who can somehow overcome the numbers. As the New York Times notes, she employed the words "fight," "fighter" and "fighting" repeatedly in last night's victory speech in Philadelphia. And she tried to turn her trailing status into an asset, declaring that she beat a candidate "who outspent us three to one," as The Wall Street Journal reports. Mr. Obama remains far ahead on the finance front, though Mrs. Clinton's campaign boasted late last night that it had raised $2.5 million since earlier in the evening thanks to her success in Pennsylvania, as The Hill points out. 
It isn't clear how much both sides' late-inning negative campaign ads helped or hurt their candidates, though the Journal notes it was Mrs. Clinton who won heavily among the voters who made their decisions in recent days. Concerns fanned by the Clinton campaign about Mr. Obama's electability in November seem to have been a factor in Pennsylvania. As she has before, Mrs. Clinton won among older voters and white women, but also among this primary season's biggest swing group, white men. And she even split the under-30 votes that have been favoring Mr. Obama. One in five voters said race was a factor in their decision, and white voters in that group backed Mrs. Clinton 3-1, the AP reports. Gender was a factor for just as many voters, but one that tended to help Mrs. Clinton. If Mr. Obama becomes the nominee, race could loom as a bigger factor in November. Republican Party officials in North Carolina are already considering running ads there that highlight Mr. Obama's ties to his former pastor, whose divisive comments haven't helped him against Mrs. Clinton, the Times reports. 
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama next face off May 6 in North Carolina, where Mr. Obama has a strong lead in the polls, and Indiana. It's the Indiana contest that offers the next hurdle for Mrs. Clinton to show her candidacy is viable enough to prolong the competition. Even after last night's success, some of her most loyal supporters were privately expressing their doubts on that front to the Washington Post, citing the all-but-unbeatable lead Mr. Obama has among delegates, in the popular vote and in the bank. Mr. Obama is expected to receive a series of new endorsements from superdelegates in the coming days, and is already trying to turn the focus of his campaigning against Republican John McCain, the New York Times adds. 
The conventional wisdom has been that the longer Democratic primaries like the bloody Pennsylvania fight continue, the more wounded the party's nominee will be ahead of the general election. The exit polls indicated that one in three Pennsylvania Democrats came out of the primary there with serious concerns about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama or both, the Journal notes. A quarter of Clinton supporters said they'd back Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama, while 16% of Mr. Obama's supporters said they'd pick the Republican over Mrs. Clinton. But Journal columnist Gerald Seib argues the conventional wisdom may be wrong. "The long campaign is making Barack Obama -- or even Hillary Clinton, if she somehow manages to pull out the nomination -- a better candidate, and just maybe a better president if he/she wins in November," he says. "Toughness and resilience are important attributes, and that is what a long campaign instills in a candidate. So just maybe this prolonged fight is good for the Democrats." 
Renewed Scrutiny of Pyongyang-Damascus Axis 
Debate in Washington over the toughness of U.S. policy toward North Korea is about to intensify. The Bush administration this week is expected to send CIA officials to brief Congress on the Israeli airstrike last year against a site in Syria and confirm that American intelligence believes North Korea was helping the Syrians to build a nuclear plant there, congressional and administration officials tell The Wall Street Journal. The Los Angeles Times reports the CIA officials will say they believe the reactor would have been capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. 
Speculation and news reports about the atomic nature of Israel's target quickly followed the attack, in both Israel and the U.S., but the White House showed uncharacteristic reticence to come out and accuse either Damascus or Pyongyang of nuclear cooperation. It was never clear if that was a sign of doubtful intelligence on the matter, or perhaps another indication of the divide within the administration on how leniently to treat North Korea in order to keep last year's six-party denuclearization accord from coming apart. It also isn't clear why the administration would break its silence now, or what evidence it will present to members of Congress. The weekend visit of South Korea's new president to Washington highlighted North Korea's failure to acknowledge all its nuclear activities -- a key part of the denuclearization pact -- and the White House's willingness, so far, to tolerate that. This only fueled the criticism of administration policy on Korea from some conservatives, and this week's briefings seem likely to do so as well. 
SEC Refuses to Explain Dropped Bear Probe Several months before Bear Stearns imploded and essentially sold itself to J.P. Morgan Chase, the Securities and Exchange Commission aborted an investigation into whether the Wall Street firm had hurt investors by improperly valuing investments that package pools of loans. Now SEC regulators, citing confidentiality, are refusing to tell Congress why, The Wall Street Journal reports. Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, asked the SEC for information about the decision to end the inquiry. But SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, setting the stage for a conflict between Congress and the agency, said the commission doesn't "disclose the existence or nonexistence of an investigation or information generated in any investigation unless made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the Commission or the courts." 
Also of Note. . . 
BBC: An estimated 300,000 people may have died as a result of the Darfur conflict, United Nations humanitarian affairs chief John Holmes told the Security Council, describing what would be an increase of 50% from a 2006 estimate of the death toll from fighting and consequential humanitarian crises in the region of western Sudan. 
Washington Post: More than 100 million people are being driven deeper into poverty by a "silent tsunami" of sharply rising food prices, which have sparked riots around the world and threaten U.N.- backed feeding programs for 20 million children, the top U.N. food official said, adding that "millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago . . . now are." 
Financial Times: Expectations rose that soaring food prices will provoke a rethink of support for biofuels in Europe and the U.S., which contributed to another surge in the price of oil, which hit a new high of almost $120 a barrel. 
International Herald Tribune: European countries are slated to build about 50 coal-fired plants over the next five years that will be used for decades, a phenomenon driven by rising electricity demand, record oil and natural-gas prices, concerns over energy security and an aversion to nuclear energy. With India and China still counting coal as a major fuel source, the return to coal even in eco-conscious Europe is sowing real alarm among environmentalists who warn that it is setting the world on a disastrous trajectory that will make controlling global warming impossible. 
Times of London: Greenpeace, emboldened by its recent success in harrying the Japanese whaling fleet, is now turning its attention to tuna fishers in the Pacific Ocean. Ships from several countries have been singled out by the environmental activists, who say that they are defending the region's rapidly dwindling tuna stocks from legal and illicit "plundering." 
New York Times: The Bush administration is endorsing a House proposal that Congress authorize the government to buy billions of dollars in federal student loans to make sure the nation's credit crunch does not block borrowing for higher education. 
Legal Times: Supreme Court justices appeared torn over the constitutionality of the so-called "Millionaires' Amendment," a law that allows the opponents of rich, self-financing candidates for Congress to receive higher contributions from individuals and parties than would otherwise be allowed. Led by Justice Antonin Scalia, several justices expressed doubt that the First Amendment allows government to manipulate campaign speech in this way, solely to "level the playing field" among candidates for office. 
Wall Street Journal: Ford Motor Chief Executive Alan Mulally is looking at selling Volvo despite Ford's repeated statements that it intends to hang on to the brand, while he hopes to shutter the ailing Mercury brand, according to people close to him, and more job cuts at the recovering auto maker may be coming. Under the former Boeing executive, Ford is showing signs of a surprise turnaround and has improved year-on-year earnings each quarter of the past year. 
Bloomberg: Billionaire Warren Buffett, who will embark on a four- city European trip next month to meet with owners of family businesses, has for years been laying the groundwork for an acquisition in Europe. "His idea is that sooner or later one of these great businesses will fall into his hands," said Angelo Moratti, scion of the founding family of Italian energy company Saras and the tour's organizer. 
San Jose Mercury News: Yahoo reported first-quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations in a strong report that could prompt Microsoft to increase its offer to buy Yahoo, though Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the company had no intention of raising its bid based on one quarter of Yahoo's earnings. 
Variety: The May sweep seasons -- used to measure ratings for television networks' advertisers -- starts Thursday, but the networks aren't exactly in a mad dash to reach the starting line because ratings are down for the hit shows that recently returned to action for the first time since the writers strike. They're also off for some established reality series that have been unable to take advantage of softer competition, including Fox's "American Idol," whose year-to- year declines have accelerated of late. 
Nature: A new study of diet journals of mothers-to-be in Britain suggests what women eat before conception influences the gender of their offspring, with a high-calorie diet -­and especially one that features routine breakfast cereals -- more likely to lead to a baby boy. The reasons aren't clear, but a connection could be linked to the fact that male test-tube embryos generally require a more glucose-rich growth medium to survive in the lab. 
Quotes of the Day 
"The purpose of this lie is clear -- [to suggest] that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no else did in history. Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it," al Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahri says, according to an audiotape attributed to him in which he accuses Shiite Muslim-dominated Iran of spreading a conspiracy theory that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks in order to keep credit from going to the Sunni-dominated terrorist network, as the Associated Press reports. 
"Al-Zawahri wanted to work with Iran, but he's deeply disappointed that Iran has not cooperated with al Qaeda," Rohan Gunaratna, a terrorism expert and head of the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore, tells the AP, adding that Mr. al-Zawahri is trying to exploit "the anti-Shiite, anti-Iran sentiments in the Arab and Muslim world."

Abstract

Full Text 
The power industry burned more coal in 2007 to make electricity, bad news for those worried about the utility sector's role in climate change. 
Since 93% of U.S. coal consumption is related to electricity production, coal sales and electricity demand are strongly correlated. The power industry consumed 1.046 billion short tons of coal in 2007, up 1.95% from the 1.026 billion short tons used in 2006, according to new data from U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Department of Energy's statistical agency. Actual electricity production rose by 1.6%, less than the increase in coal usage. 
The increased used of coal came despite rising wholesale prices. Utilities paid an average $36.08 a short ton for delivered coal in 2007, according to the preliminary EIA data, up 5.3% from the prior year and up nearly 40% from $25.82 in 2003. 
The increase in coal consumption is related to a shift to the use of western coal, mostly from Montana and Wyoming, which generates less heat than coal mined in the eastern 
U.S. Nevertheless, western coal is often used because it contains less sulfur than eastern coal, making it easier for power plants to meet certain air-emissions limits. 
The impact of higher coal costs is twofold. It lifts expenses for coal-burning generators, and it also inflates overall prices for electricity in some markets even for generators that don't burn coal. That's because coal units effectively set a benchmark price for electricity in some regional markets. The effect is most pronounced in the Midwest and East, less so in the South and West. 
Helped by a weak dollar, coal exports jumped 19% for the year to 59.2 million short tons from 49.7 million short tons in 2006. Coal imports, the EIA said, were "static" for the year. 
Rising prices and looming carbon legislation have put the coal industry on the defensive. It has been trying to promote research into "clean coal" to satisfy climate-change concerns but has suffered significant reversals due to the perceived cost. 
Early in the year, the Bush administration canceled the "Future Gen" program to construct a power plant that would turn coal into a hydrogen-rich fuel and use it to make electricity. 
This month, Virginia utility regulators rejected a rate request by Appalachian Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power Co., seeking funding for a proposed coal-gasification power plant in West Virginia. State regulators said they found the utility's projected $2.23 billion cost for the 629-megawatt plant "not credible" because it hadn't been revised since 2006. The State Corporation Commission said "we cannot ask Virginia ratepayers to bear the enormous risks -- and potential huge costs -- of these uncertainties." 
An AEP spokeswoman said the utility said it would seek a rehearing and will update its numbers. 
This week, two coal-industry groups said they will join forces to more effectively lobby Congress and reach out to the public. 
The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity is being funded by about $45 million a year by utilities, coal producers, equipment makers, railroads and others with a vested stake in coal use. ACCCE is the successor organization for Americans for Balanced Energy Choices and the Center for Energy and Economic Development founded, respectively, in 1992 and 2000 
Spokesman Joe Lucas said the power industry has made tremendous gains in reducing many pollutants from power plants and "we recognize the next challenge is carbon dioxide."

Surge in Natural-Gas Price Stoked by New Global Trade; Further Gains Likely Despite 93% Spike; Bidding With Japan

Abstract 
By 2025, the U.S. could see domestic production lag demand by 15 billion to 20 billion cubic feet a day, Linda Cook, executive director of gas and power for Royal Dutch Shell PLC, told a recent energy conference. The increased global trade in natural gas was driven partly by huge investments since 2003 in facilities to liquefy gas for export -- chilling it to negative-260 degrees Fahrenheit -- as big Western oil companies saw a business opportunity and ramped up spending on LNG infrastructure. 

Full text 
Americans feeling the pain of record gasoline prices now face the likelihood of another fuel shock, from natural gas. 
Prices in the U.S. have risen 93% since late August as power-hungry nations like South Korea and Japan compete in a global natural-gas market that scarcely existed a half-decade ago. Still, U.S. prices are as low as half the level of some overseas markets, suggesting they have much further to rise. 
The global appetite for natural gas has profound implications for a U.S. economy already tipping toward recession and struggling against inflation pressures. The fuel heats half of U.S. homes, generates 20% of the country's electricity and is used to make everything from fertilizer to plastic bags. In March, rising natural-gas prices contributed to a higher than expected 1.1% increase in producer prices, according to the Labor Department. 
U.S. natural-gas output has actually been rising in recent months, and not everyone agrees that prices are destined to surge. However, a significant number of financial players are now betting on an increase. 
On Thursday a report by the Barclays Capital unit of Barclays PLC warned that, partly because of rising natural-gas prices, the U.S. could start to see spikes in electricity costs in as little as a year. "Power is at the cusp of its next boom cycle," analysts said. "When power markets tighten, prices do not notch up, they skyrocket." 
On Thursday, natural-gas prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell five cents per million British thermal units, or 0.5%, to settle at $10.383, ending a three-day upward march. That's 33% shy of the record close of $15.378 on Dec. 13, 2005, when a cold snap jolted the market. 
What's new is the global price competition. Prior to 2003, gas was primarily a regional commodity, consumed near where it was produced and transported by pipelines. Often, it would be simply burned off as waste at oil wells, since transportation was so difficult. 
That changed with development of cheaper methods for supercooling and transporting the fuel across the ocean in liquefied form, which requires 1/600th the space. The global trade took off. 
Today, a tanker of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, pulling into port in Japan can command close to $20 per million BTUs, roughly double the price of the U.S. benchmark. As a result, the U.S. is having trouble attracting the imports it needs to supplement homegrown production. 
Last weekend, Cheniere Energy Inc. inaugurated a massive new LNG terminal on the Texas-Louisiana border capable of accommodating six tankers a week, making it the largest terminal in the U.S. However, observers expect few tankers to dock there until they can obtain higher prices for their cargo. Cheniere's stock is down 70% from its 52­week high; earlier this year, it put itself up for sale. 
For the moment at least, the import slowdown means the U.S. has a glut of LNG import terminals like these. From California to New England, proposals for such facilities have faced staunch community opposition. This month New York Gov. David Paterson said the state wouldn't issue a permit for a proposed terminal in the Long Island Sound, arguing that it wasn't appropriate for the environmentally sensitive area. 
Overall, U.S. imports of LNG have slid over the past nine months to a five-year low, and natural-gas inventories are running relatively low. Deutsche Bank commodities chief David Silbert says that if the U.S. is unable to attract LNG supply this summer, prices could spike up sharply within a few months if a hot summer were to reduce the ability to build a cushion of gas going into next winter. 
As the odds increase that the U.S. will pass climate-change regulations that raise financial penalties for burning coal, cleaner- burning natural gas is gaining favor as the fuel to power electric plants. 
Overall, gas demand from the U.S. power sector grew by 10% last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. By 2025, the U.S. could see domestic production lag demand by 15 billion to 20 billion cubic feet a day, Linda Cook, executive director of gas and power for Royal Dutch Shell PLC, told a recent energy conference. 
The increased global trade in natural gas was driven partly by huge investments since 2003 in facilities to liquefy gas for export -- chilling it to negative-260 degrees Fahrenheit -- as big Western oil companies saw a business opportunity and ramped up spending on LNG infrastructure. This created economies of scale and further drove down the price of producing and shipping LNG long distances. 
This triggered a revolution in gas markets. Previously, countries like Nigeria, which has ample natural gas, had no easy way to sell it due to a lack of pipelines to markets needing the fuel. Same was true for Qatar, also home to enormous gas reserves. 
Early thinking assumed the globalized market would cause prices to fall because countries tight on supplies could more easily import. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, in 2003, predicted LNG would create a "price-pressure safety valve" to stabilize prices in the U.S. 
But the market is evolving differently. One key change involves the way LNG sales contracts are written. Until recently, buyers were in the driver's seat: They were able to strike long-term deals and lock in their costs for many years. A seller like Indonesia, for instance, might have agreed to ship LNG to Japan for 10 years at relatively rigid prices. 
Today, however, sellers have the clout. They are demanding that contracts be loosened to let them divert their output to markets where prices are higher. (In return they generally agree to share the profits with the customer.) 
This free-for-all has let suppliers shop their product to the highest bidder, adding to price volatility. 
One example: When an earthquake last summer forced a massive Japanese nuclear plant to close, utilities there ramped up natural-gas use. Prices soared in Japan, which in turn drove up prices in far-off European countries, including the United Kingdom. 
This kind of situation can trigger domino effects world-wide. Late last year, the global scramble for scarce LNG worsened as a drought hit Spain, cutting its ability to use hydroelectric power. Spain normally leans on neighboring Algeria and Egypt for LNG imports -- but in February those countries were busy shipping to Japan where prices were twice as high as Spain. 
Spain turned to Trinidad for imports. But that has meant less gas for the closer -- but lower-priced -- U.S. market, which in the past has taken most of Trinidad's output. Trinidad's shipments to the U.S. through the first two months of the year are down 31% from the year- earlier period, according to government data. 
Not everyone agrees U.S. natural-gas prices are certain to rise. Domestic producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. have made significant strides tapping into new sources of natural gas, sending U.S. gas production up 7% in January from a year earlier, to 68 billion cubic feet a day. 
Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey K. McClendon sees production continuing to grow, holding U.S. gas prices between $7 to $10 per million BTUs and avoiding the need to increase imports. And Michael Stoppard, a senior director of energy consultant CERA, predicts world LNG supply will grow by 30% in the next two years, making more chilled gas available for the U.S. 
Nevertheless, more financial players are lining up against the bears, saying low prices won't last. They point out that, even as U.S. production increased in 2007, prices still rose 19%. 
Meantime, as Asian buyers grab more LNG from the Atlantic basin, U.S. prices, though at 27-month highs, still look cheap. Energy hedge funds in Houston and New York have placed a flood of bullish bets on U.S. gas prices for delivery several years from now, say some of the traders and their Wall Street brokers. 
One argument underpinning that bet: U.S. gas is far cheaper than it has historically been relative to crude oil. Until 2004, the price for a barrel of oil was roughly the same as the price of 6,000 cubic feet of gas, the equivalent amount of energy. Now oil is almost double the price of gas on that basis, Lehman Brothers analysts point out. 
In a twist, the effort to build alternative-energy projects like solar arrays and wind farms also boosts construction of gas-fired plants. Because wind is unpredictable, it's often necessary to build back-up generators, and gas-fired plants have an advantage in that they can be started up relatively quickly, says Doug Kimmelman, senior partner with Energy Capital Partners, a private-equity firm focused on the power sector. 
In addition, regulatory approval and construction times are shorter for gas plants than coal or nuclear. For reasons like these, new gas- fired power plants continue to be built or planned.

Full text 
Signaling that aging nuclear-power plants may face greater scrutiny, U.S. regulators have told utilities to more rigorously analyze metal fatigue at several sites, including two opposed by environmentalists. 
The heightened scrutiny comes as a slew of older plants, dating to the late 1960s and early 1970s, seek operating-license renewals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC has extended the licenses of four dozen nuclear-power reactors since 2000. It is considering requests for nearly a dozen more, including Exelon Corp.'s Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey and Entergy Corp.'s Vermont Yankee plant, which have been targeted by environmentalists. 
The NRC has received applications for 15 new reactors, with many more expected. The revival is driven by concerns about growing power needs and global-warming emissions from power sources such as coal. 
Attention to new plants has spilled over to older plants. The Senate expressed interest in the license issue this week. Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, part of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, said he intends to hold a hearing next month on new-reactor licensing and will expand the scope to include extensions of existing licenses. 
In the case of the Oyster Creek and Vermont Yankee plants, environmental groups have challenged metal-fatigue analyses; specifically, whether metal used in some pieces of equipment is strong enough to last another 20 years without jeopardizing safety. The commission's judicial arm, the Atomic Safety Licensing Board, has agreed to evaluate the matter. 
In the interim, the commission issued a notice last week agreeing that the current "simplified" method of calculation may not be "conservative" enough. 
"We concluded the analysis should have been more layered and detailed than it was," said Neil Sheehan, an NRC spokesman in the Northeast region. 
The new scrutiny may not hinder license extensions. A spokeswoman for Exelon said the company believes "results will be similar" from the new methodology versus the old, because "we believe they're equally conservative." 
John Dreyfuss, director of nuclear safety at the Vermont Yankee plant, said he doesn't think a change in metal-fatigue calculations will "drive any physical changes" at his plant because he expects it to pass either way. He said most parts and materials are engineered to rigorous standards and are highly durable. 
It is unusual for interveners to mount a successful challenge, in part because the NRC has limited the scope of matters that may be raised in re-licensing proceedings. Interveners must identify deficiencies in an operator's plans to mitigate the effects of aging, but they aren't allowed to challenge things such as the proximity of the plant to a growing population, waste-disposal issues or some other matters. 
Nearly half the U.S. fleet of 104 reactors faces license expirations from 2009 through 2015. No utility requesting a license extension has been refused to date, although the NRC sometimes attaches conditions to renewals. 
One challenger to Oyster Creek said he regarded the NRC notice as a victory because it demonstrates the value of public intervention. "Our view is the NRC is missing safety issues that need to be addressed," said Richard Webster, an attorney for the Eastern Environmental Law Center in Newark, N.J., which is active in the challenge. 
One challenge concerned metal used in equipment near the reactor pressure vessel -- the heart of the nuclear plant -- and is subject to forces that can accelerate aging. The commission has identified metal fatigue as fundamental risk in aging plants. 
Although the NRC believes plants can operate safely far longer than 40 years, it has acknowledged that some components have been designed for a 40-year life and may require special monitoring, strengthening or replacement. 
The NRC staff instructed utilities that have requested license extensions to perform additional analysis. Utilities with plants that already have received renewals are instructed to "evaluate their situation relative to any fatigue calculations." 
The U.S. derives about 20% of its electricity from nuclear-power reactors, and the percentage has remained constant even though no significant number of reactors has been added in many years. The industry has wrung more power out of existing plants by running them better and running them harder. Mass retirements will commence after 2030.

U.S. News: Climate Issues Divide U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Big Members

Abstract 
With Democrats poised to make further gains in Congress, retired Marine Corps commandant Gen. James L. Jones, president and chief executive of the chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy, said the chamber's "Republican free-market philosophy" is due for fine-tuning. 

Full text 
Thomas Donohue built the U.S. Chamber of Commerce into Washington's biggest-spending lobbying group by seizing the opportunities of a pro- business, Republican decade. 
But as Washington tilts more Democratic, populist and green, some big companies are becoming leery of allying too closely with conservative, antiregulatory institutions such as the chamber. On issues such as climate change, Mr. Donohue is finding his efforts countered by big corporations, several of them chamber members, taking a more liberal public stance. 
General Electric Co. has bucked the chamber in a fight over caps on greenhouse-gas emissions. GE, with its strong power-equipment business, sees its future in green energy. 
All three presidential candidates say they want to cap greenhouse- gas emissions and create a market for companies to trade pollution rights. The chamber and the White House have been less enthusiastic, but at least eight powerful chamber members -- including GE, Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa Inc. -- have joined with environmental groups to lobby for a "cap-and-trade" system favorable to them. 
President Bush weighed in on the global warming issue Wednesday and proposed a new target for ending the growth of the nation's greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025. Mr. Bush's new position is viewed by some as an attempt to influence congressional debate and mitigate any legislation's toll on industry and the economy. 
"We are glad [Mr. Bush] is stepping into the breach on this issue in terms of the need for a legislative fix," instead of a regulatory response, said Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at the chamber. 
The debate over "cap and trade" is one of several issues that have sparked dissent among chamber members. The chamber has also split with big companies over a consumer-product safety bill now in Congress. Toy and appliance makers supported stricter standards. The chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers didn't. 
Congressional Democrats are becoming more aggressive in challenging business priorities, such as their move last week to sideline a free- trade deal with Colombia. With Democrats poised to make further gains in Congress, retired Marine Corps commandant Gen. James L. Jones, president and chief executive of the chamber's Institute for 21st Century Energy, said the chamber's "Republican free-market philosophy" is due for fine-tuning. "You can't be simply seen as leaning one way or the other," he said. 
The chamber said its free-market stance will remain no matter who ends up in the White House or Congress. While the group is backing pro-business candidates in both parties, it is working to keep Democrats from gaining too much of an advantage in November. 
During Mr. Donohue's tenure, he has tripled the chamber's revenue. Based in a regal stone building one block from the White House, the chamber has a global footprint and a budget of $4 million a week. 
When Mr. Donohue took the helm in 1997, the chamber was a sturdy but politically weak antitax, antiregulatory voice of American business. Mr. Donohue, a former president of the American Trucking Associations, took the job after persuading the chamber to take stands even when powerful members disagreed. 
"Every now and then you get a company that said, 'Well, if you don't do that, we'll quit.' We say, 'So quit,'" Mr. Donohue said. 
The chamber flexes its muscles through lobbying and campaign cash. The 300,000-member group plans to spend at least $20 million to support pro-business congressional candidates this year and will spend another $20 million on state attorneys-general races, Mr. Donohue said. 
During the past four election cycles, the chamber's political action committee has allocated 80% of its contributions to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But in 2008, reports show a shift -- still slight -- toward Democrats. 
Many chamber members say they value the organization's bipartisan work on intellectual property, tax and education, as well as its campaign for infrastructure improvement. The group has also worked to establish pro-business legal precedents in the federal courts. 
To build support before taking a stand on an issue, the chamber usually convenes affected members for an internal debate, "rather than have all those debates publicly going up to the Hill, which is confusing to everybody," said the chamber's Mr. Josten. 
Climate change, however, has put divisions within the chamber's base on public display. 
The chamber has formed a group with big oil, gas and coal-mining interests to oppose a proposal to cap greenhouse-gas emissions sponsored by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, and Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican. Mr. Josten, who serves as spokesman for the group, called the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth, said the bill would harm the economy and make no impact on global warming if foreign countries such as China don't curb emissions, too. 
The chamber has posted two ads on YouTube questioning the climate bill. One shows Americans sleeping in winter scarves, cooking over candles and walking to work, saying "climate legislation being considered by Congress could make it too expensive to heat our homes, power our lives and drive our cars." 
The chamber's public stance "makes it more difficult for the authors of the legislation to go to environmentalists and defend those accommodations to industry," said David McIntosh, a legislative assistant to Sen. Lieberman. 
Mr. Donohue said the chamber isn't inflexibly opposed to action on greenhouse gases. "We are positively committed to dealing with the global-warming issue in a vigorous, expensive and passionate way," he said.

Abstract 
[...] the Supreme Court ruled last year that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and can be regulated by the EPA. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- President Bush called for halting the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025, and said his administration would be willing to commit the U.S. to binding emissions targets if developing countries such as China and India would agree to such commitments as well. 
But he provided few specifics on how to achieve his emissions- reductions targets and Democrats criticized Mr. Bush for declining to support legislation in Congress that attempts to halt emissions growth much faster. 
In a speech at the White House, Mr. Bush reiterated his view that any strategy to reduce emissions will depend heavily on new technologies. He said the U.S. would need to focus on slowing the growth of power-sector emissions so that they peak within 10 to 15 years and decline thereafter. 
At the same time, Mr. Bush warned against "sudden and drastic emissions cuts" that he said would harm the U.S. economy. He also reiterated his support for nuclear power, whose expansion has long been opposed by many Democrats, and for taking advantage of "our nation's huge reserves of coal." 
"There is a wrong way and a right way to approach reducing greenhouse-gas emissions," Mr. Bush said. "Bad legislation would impose tremendous costs on our economy and American families without accomplishing the important climate-change goals we share." 
Business groups, including those representing manufacturers and utilities, largely applauded Mr. Bush's remarks, particularly his emphasis on the need for emissions cuts by other countries and on technologies that significantly cut carbon emissions. Some of those technologies, such as those that capture carbon-dioxide emissions at power plants and sequester them underground, are still years from widespread commercial viability. The Energy Department withdrew its support for a project to test carbon-capture and storage technology in January after huge cost overruns. 
Mr. Bush's remarks come as a growing number of businesses want federal action on global warming following moves by California and other states to adopt their own greenhouse-gas restrictions. 
"It signals that if there is no movement on the part of Congress, the states and courts will affect a crazy quilt of regulation," said William K. Reilly, a Republican who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Mr. Bush's father. 
In addition, the Supreme Court ruled last year that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and can be regulated by the EPA. 
Mr. Bush warned that allowing the agency to set policy on carbon- dioxide emissions could give "unelected regulators" power over the activity of relatively small enterprises, not just big power plants. 
The Senate is prepared to vote in June on legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions across the U.S. economy by 66% below 2005 levels by 2050. That bill also calls for halting growth in greenhouse-gas emissions starting in 2012, 13 years sooner than Mr. Bush proposes. 
"I am glad the president finally wants to engage on the issue of climate change," said John Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "The best way for him to do that is by coming forward with a concrete legislative proposal." 
All three major presidential candidates, including Republican Sen. John McCain, have supported efforts to curb emissions that are more onerous than some industries would like. 
Many members of the Republican Party remain opposed to economywide regulation, arguing that it would slow economic growth and put the U.S. at a disadvantage against fast-growing economies such as China and India. Those countries have argued that the U.S. and other developed nations should commit to reductions first, since their economies have contributed to emissions growth for far longer. 
Mr. Bush said he and other administration officials would "urge each country to develop its own goals and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," and that the U.S. could accept binding international agreements "so long as our fellow major economies are prepared to include their plans in such an agreement."

Abstract 
The company, which says its hybrid system increases fuel efficiency by 15% to 20% while reducing carbon emissions, expects orders of around 4,000 hybrid units a year once trials are completed this year with U.K. supermarket chain Tesco PLC, construction and engineering company Balfour Beatty, U.K. building company Rok PLC. and others.

LONDON -- Wales may have been well known in the past for its coal mines and polluting heavy industry but now the region wants to cash in on the growing financial opportunities in low-carbon development by combining its natural resources in renewables with innovation in clean technology. 
By 2025, Wales wants to generate all its electricity from renewable sources and even become a net exporter -- an aim analysts say is feasible. In the meantime, the regional government is working to attract companies involved in the research and innovation side of the sector with a view to becoming a leading center for alternative-energy research and development in the United Kingdom. 
"We're very committed to achieving this goal, but we can't do it on our own," said David Jones, vice president of International Business Wales, the trade and investment arm of the Welsh Assembly, the regional government. "We realize that if it's just the public sector, it probably wouldn't happen, so we had to try to encourage innovators to come to Wales." 
Wales, with its windy weather, long coastline and huge tidal range in the River Severn Estuary, is well placed to become a significant producer and exporter of green energy, particularly with its location close to the huge market in England. 
Although investment in renewable energy in Wales has so far been around GBP 1 billion, or about $1.98 billion, the regional government's plan to increase green electricity output to 16 gigawatts by 2025 from 400 megawatts now will require around GBP 26 billion, said Ron Loveland, director of sustainable energy and industry at the Welsh Assembly. 
Wales is betting on two huge projects: the GBP 15 billion Severn Estuary tidal barrage and the largest biomass plant in the world in Port Talbot to generate the bulk of electricity. Wind farms, biomass and marine energy -- such as wave power and tidal power -- would supplement the total. 
In tandem with the renewables targets, Wales is working to boost investment in clean technology -- a sector that includes solar photovoltaic cells and hybrid cars, as well as research into energy efficiency in buildings and power stations. 
Companies and analysts say the streamlined bureaucracy and decision- making process in Wales, access to skilled labor and proximity to universities for research and development have made the region an ideal location to set up a clean-tech business. 
"Wales has a good track record of attracting inward investment and getting its act together to generate economic development in a specific area," said Jonathan Johns, head of renewables at consulting firm Ernst & Young. 
"It's also got very good natural resources, as well as a strong technical base, so it's very well placed for research and development in the clean-tech sector," he added. 
For the smaller companies that are typical of this sector, these sorts of incentives are important. Many of them are working on tight budgets as they concentrate on converting cutting-edge ideas and technology into a finished product. 
G24 Innovations Ltd. has invested $75 million in a factory in Wales to manufacture lightweight and durable silicon-free thin-film solar cells to power mobile-phone chargers in countries such as India or across Africa where electricity grids aren't widespread, but mobile- phone penetration is increasing. 
President J. Clemens Betzel said G24i initially looked at the greater London area, but prohibitively expensive real estate prompted them to look elsewhere. "We found a very good site for the factory in Wales, the level of bureaucracy limited and the turnaround time on the site very quick, as the land was owned by the Welsh Assembly Government," Mr. Betzel said. 
G24i, which has contracts with Vodacom in Tanzania and Kenya, and a distribution deal with the U.S.'s Bright Star Ventures Ltd., plans to ramp up output this year to several million units as further deals develop with Motorola Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. 
Vodacom is jointly owned by South Africa's Telkom SA and the U.K.'s Vodafone. G24i hopes to expand the applications of its thin film to include chargers for laptops and other electronic devices such as surveillance systems and base stations for mobile-phone stations. 
Connaught Engineering Ltd., which produces a hybrid system that can be retrofitted to commercial vehicles, has invested half of a GBP 12 million investment package in South Wales, where it has just commissioned a factory. 
The company, which says its hybrid system increases fuel efficiency by 15% to 20% while reducing carbon emissions, expects orders of around 4,000 hybrid units a year once trials are completed this year with U.K. supermarket chain Tesco PLC, construction and engineering company Balfour Beatty, U.K. building company Rok PLC. and others. 
It's also involved in the development of four other hybrid systems for other types of vehicles. 
Chief Executive Tony Martindale said that the strong automotive expertise in Wales, site of Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. engine-manufacturing plants, combined with the research at the universities, would help the company to develop new products. 
"We use a lot of the research programs at the universities as the research and development feed for future developments in our business," Mr. Martindale said. 
Other companies in the clean-tech sector in Wales include Japan's Sharp Corp., which is doubling production capacity for solar photovoltaic modules at its plant in North Wales to 220 megawatts a year. The plant in Wales is the company's second largest outside Japan. 
Ernst & Young's Mr. Johns said that as well as attracting companies, the Welsh Assembly is very skilled at getting funding from the U.K. government or from the European Union for R&D projects and channeling it to the right place, be it companies or institutes. "Partly, that's down to the degree of devolvement and merging of budgets so that money can be focused and given to initiatives rather than being dispersed across lots of different projects," Mr. Johns said. 
One such grant winner is Corus, the European arm of Tata Steel Ltd., and Australian solar photovoltaic company Dyesol Ltd. that recently secured funding from the Welsh Assembly for their joint project on developing solar-cell technology on steel for building integrated photovoltaic applications. 
The new "Wales Low Carbon Research Institute" is one of the research facilities expected to receive "significant" money from the EU's GBP 1.4 billion convergence fund for Wales, said the Welsh Assembly's Mr. Loveland. 
"The institute has already received a grant of GBP 5 million to increase the number of academics involved in low-carbon research, but they're expected to get significant money from the EU fund, which has around GBP 60 million for climate-change projects and GBP 100 million for innovation," he said.

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- In a significant shift on global warming, President Bush will propose stopping growth in U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 2025 and signal that he is open to lawmakers reining in pollution from power companies. 
The stance, set to be unveiled Wednesday at a White House speech, indicates Mr. Bush's willingness to grapple with the growing legislative debate over global warming. It marks an acknowledgment by the Bush administration that the U.S. likely will adopt some sort of broad new legal system to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in coming years. Mr. Bush has opposed comprehensive legislation to curb emissions. 
But like an increasing number of utilities and manufacturers, he is aiming to join the discussions in hopes of shaping the debate and creating a system that won't be too costly to industry or consumers. 
Mr. Bush faces the challenge of attracting sympathetic Republicans to support concrete proposals in the waning days of his administration. The White House is under pressure from a growing number of big businesses to take more action this year to spare them from the prospect of still-tougher regulation. 
All three major presidential candidates, including Republican Sen. John McCain, have supported efforts to curb emissions that are more onerous than some industries would like. The Bush administration contends that one proposal, soon to be debated in the Senate, that seeks to halt emissions growth by 2012 is too costly. 
Mr. Bush's goals will likely face criticism from Democrats and environmental groups because they are less ambitious than other targets before U.S. lawmakers. They also will face hostility from conservatives who worry that showing flexibility now will mean giving up too much ground. 
Environmentalists and other groups already have gained ground without comprehensive emissions legislation. They have successfully pushed lawsuits and regulatory actions that would use the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act to address the problem of global warming. The White House fears a regulatory train wreck that could create a bewildering and costly set of rules affecting not just major emitters but office buildings and schools. 
Overall U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases fell 1.1% in 2006 from the previous year. But the general trend has been one of growth, with emissions rising 14.7% from 1990 to 2006, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
In the most specific part of his speech, Mr. Bush will carve out a more ambitious goal for power generators, source of about 40% of U.S. emissions. He will call for a halt in the growth of greenhouse gases from electric power plants within 10 to 15 years. He won't propose specific legislation, but White House officials hope his goals could shape a growing congressional debate. 
The White House continues to oppose economywide caps on emissions, but it is not shutting the door to creative market-based approaches to particular sectors. That could include what's known as a cap-and-trade system, in which companies buy and sell what amount to permits to emit global-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. Proponents say such a system gives companies financial incentives to curb emissions. 
"We're not favoring one policy tool over another," said one senior official who provided a detailed preview of the remarks, noting the administration has supported market-based systems in several contexts. 
A spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington-based group that represents U.S. utilities, declined to comment ahead of Mr. Bush's speech. 
The U.S. Energy Department has projected that carbon-dioxide emissions from power generation will rise 19% between 2007 and 2030 as a result of new or expanded coal-fired plants. 
In his remarks, President Bush is expected to focus less on sectors outside power. Instead, the remarks will be devoted to shaping the eventual debate rather than offering specific proposals. He will highlight the costs that the wrong approach on climate change would impose for U.S. businesses and consumers. 
Mr. Bush is expected to say the administration has made progress on several fronts, such as improving vehicle efficiency standards. He will make the case that elected lawmakers, not bureaucrats, should decide how to reshape the regulatory framework. 
He will also argue against legislation that raises taxes or makes demands that are technologically unattainable and could hurt the economy, such as by raising fuel costs. He will call for more emphasis on new technology rather than raising the price of old technology. 
The administration wants to make sure that coal, which currently provides about half of U.S. power needs and is a major source of greenhouse gases, isn't squeezed out of the 
U.S. power sector. It also will oppose placing tariffs on goods from other countries over global- warming concerns. That could set up what the official warned could become a "carbon-based global trade war." 
The White House wants to shift financial incentives to favor emissions-reducing energy sources, such as nuclear power and renewable fuels, in part to boost U.S. manufacturing. 
Carbon dioxide, considered the main man-made global warming gas, is emitted when fossil fuels are burned. Scientists say the gases collect in the atmosphere, forming a blanket that traps heat, raising global temperatures. A United Nations panel said earlier this year that human activity is "very likely" the cause of a global-warming trend in recent decades. 
The administration's goal of halting the growth of emissions by 2025 appears aimed at speeding up international negotiations over a replacement treaty for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, and persuading developing giants such as China and India to enact potentially painful curbs to their own soaring emissions. 
The White House considers that crucial to achieving a follow-on agreement. Officials believe a pact that doesn't include China and India could put U.S. industry at a cost disadvantage and accelerate the flow of jobs to those countries, while failing to make any significant inroads on world-wide emissions. 
Previously, the administration has proposed only a short-term goal of slowing growth of greenhouse gases by 18%, as measured against economic output, by 2012 through piecemeal efforts such as the new vehicle efficiency rules, as well as renewable fuel increases and appliance and lighting efficiency. 
"The U.S. has a significant portion already in law of what we need," the official said. 
Mr. Bush's move comes as the U.S. Senate is preparing to take up legislation that calls for reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by as much as 25% below 2005 emissions levels in 2020 and by as much as 66% below 2005 emissions levels in 2050. The legislation, sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I., Conn.) and John Warner (R., Va.), would allow companies that exceeded the limits to buy credits from other companies that met them with room to spare. 
Many large businesses now endorse the idea of setting caps on greenhouse-gas emissions, though few have publicly committed to supporting the Lieberman-Warner measure. 
At a meeting with House Republicans last week, White House officials warned that the EPA is on track to eventually regulate carbon-dioxide emissions through the Clean Air Act, according to a lawmaker who was present. 
"They [White House officials] were trying to get the temperature [of lawmakers] on climate-change legislation and trying to get engaged," said the lawmaker, Rep. John Shimkus (R., Ill.). Mr. Shimkus said the response from his fellow Republicans was "very skeptical." 
"It's a game of chicken. Do you do nothing during this Congress? . . . Or by doing that do you run the risk of really terrible legislation in the next Congress?" Mr. Shimkus said. "That's what we're trying to figure out." 
Environmentalists first petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases in 1999, and Mr. Bush, as a presidential candidate in 2000, vowed to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions if elected. He retreated from that pledge shortly into his first term, citing concern that such a move would lead to higher energy prices.

Abstract 
Campaigning in the Pennsylvania presidential primary this month, Senators Clinton and Obama are championing technology to capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions from coal -- while vowing to invest in renewable energies such as wind and solar power. Democratic congressional leaders -- and all three remaining Democratic and Republican presidential candidates -- advocate the creation of a "cap- and-trade" system that would place limits on carbon-dioxide emissions and let companies buy or sell rights to pollute. 

Full text 
The race for the Democratic nomination hinges on a handful of states where coal is still king. That puts Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in a bind: how to attack global warming without threatening an industry that provides half the U.S.'s electricity and more than 80,000 mining jobs. 
Campaigning in the Pennsylvania presidential primary this month, Senators Clinton and Obama are championing technology to capture and store carbon-dioxide emissions from coal -- while vowing to invest in renewable energies such as wind and solar power. 
"Coal is going to remain a major player in American energy," Senator Clinton told the Pittsburgh Business Times last month. 
"We are the Saudi Arabia of coal, and it could be a very important way for us to meet our long-term energy needs," Senator Obama told voters Wednesday in Levittown, Pa. 
The candidates' comments reflect a broader challenge for Democrats, as efforts to build coal-fired plants pit Democrats in struggling rural areas against city and suburban dwellers worried about climate change. 
In Kansas, rural Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans in opposition to Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius's decision to reject two new coal-fired plants that would have brought $3.6 billion in investment to the state. In New Mexico, Navajo leaders are sparring with Gov. Bill Richardson, who opposes their effort to build a coal- fired plant to bring jobs to the Navajo reservation. Both governors said the projects would contribute to global warming. 
In Virginia, Democrats at opposite ends of the state are clashing over a $1.8 billion coal-fired power plant proposed for the state's impoverished southwest corner. Governor Tim Kaine backs the plant even as he vows to cut greenhouse gas emissions -- a stance that has confounded many supporters in the state's affluent northern suburbs. 
"There's no way to power the needs of our commonwealth or our nation without using our coal resources," Gov. Kaine said. 
These state-level skirmishes are forerunners of the debate taking shape in Washington over how to address global warming. Democratic congressional leaders -- and all three remaining Democratic and Republican presidential candidates -- advocate the creation of a "cap- and-trade" system that would place limits on carbon-dioxide emissions and let companies buy or sell rights to pollute. 
That support masks significant differences over how to cap emissions without hurting industries that rely heavily on coal. Democrats from rural states that rely on coal for electricity support legislation that would allocate some emissions credits for free to utilities and other large carbon-dioxide emitters. 
Other Democrats, including Senators Obama and Clinton, say all pollution credits should be auctioned, to ensure that companies don't obtain windfall profits. Some, such as Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, want to put an immediate halt to construction of any new coal-burning plants that lack technology to sequester carbon dioxide emissions. Many experts say that the technology is years from widespread commercial viability. The Energy Department withdrew its support for a project to test such technology in January after huge cost overruns. 
Groups funded by the coal industry and its allies are spending heavily to bolster public support for coal, and to reinforce fears that limits on its use will raise living costs. A Virginia-based group called Americans for Balanced Energy Choices is spending as much as $40 million on TV ads and other outreach efforts. 
In Virginia -- whose 13 electoral votes could be decisive in November -- the dilemma facing Mr. Kaine centers on efforts by Richmond's Dominion Resources Inc. to build a 585­megawatt plant in Wise County, an Appalachian coal-mining community where 20% of the population lives in poverty. 
Mr. Kaine has gone out of his way to promote the project. His 2007 Virginia Energy Plan, a document meant to guide state policymakers, mentions the project 10 times. It says that Virginia "should work together" with its coal producers "to maintain a viable mining industry that supports the economy in southwest Virginia." 
At the same time, Mr. Kaine is spearheading Virginia's push to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2025, an undertaking that some fear will be undercut by the new plant. The facility would emit 5.4 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of putting 895,000 more automobiles on Virginia roads, by some estimates. 
Some Democrats worry that the plant also will emit large quantities of smog-forming pollutants that could drift beyond Wise. But those complaints rankle many in Wise County. The plant would generate hundreds of new jobs, double Wise's tax base and fund a renovation of the county's 1950s-era high schools. In the winter, students wear coats in class because only one of the school's three boilers still works. 
Some environmentalists have questioned Mr. Kaine's motives for supporting the proposed plant. Since 2001, Dominion has contributed more than $230,000 to Mr. Kaine's campaign coffers, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a group that tracks campaign contributions in Virginia. Mr. Kaine says Dominion's donations haven't influenced 
him, adding, "I'm sure I've received as much or more from people on the other side of this issue."

Abstract 
Burning the algae fuel means the carbon has been used twice before being released, displacing greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil, and adding to the power company's profitability when carbon is regulated. 

Full Text 
In the Frank Capra movie classic, "It's a Wonderful Life," the Bailey Brothers Building and Loan is facing a Depression-era bank run. George Bailey leaps over the counter, blocks the door, and says to the panicky investors that they're "thinking of this place all wrong." 
Today's investors need to hear the same message: If you're worried that stopping global warming will wreck the economy, you're looking at this all wrong. Solving global warming will be an added cost, yes -- but a bargain compared with the economic cost of unchecked climate change. And fixing this problem will create an historic economic opportunity. 
Energy is the biggest business in the world, "the mother of all markets," says venture capitalist John Doerr, Google's first funder. The winners of the race to reinvent energy will not only save the planet, but will also make megafortunes. Venture capitalists and companies like Google are already jockeying to fund clean energy start-ups. In 2007, clean tech was the fastest growing category of venture investing in the U.S., growing four times as much as Internet investing, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 
Action on global warming is coming soon. Governors, mayors and CEOs are already making bold and binding commitments; the presumptive presidential candidates from both parties are strong supporters of new federal policy initiatives. Meanwhile, under the radar, smart entrepreneurs are inventing new technologies to cash in on the high- tech bonanza to come, offering clean, affordable energy without carbon emissions. 
A Silicon Valley firm, Innovalight, has figured out a way to harvest solar energy much more cheaply than present technology allows by dissolving silicon nanocrystals in ink, which will ultimately be printed onto roof panels like we print ink onto paper. Using a platform they developed as postdoctoral students at Berkeley, the founding scientists of a company called Amyris have re-engineered yeast to ferment sugar into pure hydrocarbon fuels. Unlike ethanol, the fuel has the energy density of gasoline (or jet fuel, if that's what they program the yeast to produce) and can be shipped through existing pipelines and pumped into any car now on the road. 
A company called GreenFuel is working to make biodiesel from the algae that feed on the carbon dioxide from power plant smokestacks. The fastest-growing plants on earth, algae can double their mass in a few hours and produce orders-of-magnitude more biomass per acre than plants grown in soil. Founder Isaac Berzin is optimistic that, at commercial scale, he will cut capital costs enough to beat oil at $60 per barrel. Burning the algae fuel means the carbon has been used twice before being released, displacing greenhouse gas emissions from burning oil, and adding to the power company's profitability when carbon is regulated. 
There's much more. Scientists have traveled to the most extreme environments on earth -- from deep-sea vents to Siberian volcanoes -- to bio-prospect for "extremophile" micro-organisms that can digest wood and plant wastes to be fermented into fuel. The Makah tribe of Native Americans, for two thousand years fisherman in the roughest Pacific waters, are working to harvest the fierce power of the waves off the Olympic Peninsula. A neurobiologist, Michael Trachtenberg, has devised a filter to clean smokestack gases at coal plants using the same enzyme that removes carbon dioxide from the human bloodstream. A bioengineer, Angela Belcher, is redesigning viruses so that they assemble themselves into the most powerful batteries ever seen. 
These bold ideas are nearly ripe, but without a strong economic incentive they won't come to market at a speed and scale sufficient to beat the swift pace of global warming. The big money, the billions of dollars required to take these technologies to the necessary scale, remains on the sidelines, waiting until the U.S. Congress sets a cap on carbon and makes the rules of the game fair and clear. 
Under a cap-and-trade regime, Congress will set limits on greenhouse gas pollution, and ratchet down those limits over time. Congress won't dictate to business which technologies to use -- the marketplace will determine the ones that work best at the lowest cost. Cap-and-trade is a proven approach. When applied to acid rain pollution in the 1980s, it solved the problem faster and cheaper than anyone thought possible. 
Global warming skeptics notwithstanding, fixing global warming won't be a drain on the economy. On the contrary, it will unleash one of the greatest floods of new wealth in history. When Congress finally acts, America's entrepreneurs and inventors will find the capital they need to solve global warming -- and a lot of people will make a killing. 
Mr. Krupp is president of Environmental Defense Fund and co-author of "Earth: The Sequel -- The Race to Reinvent Energy and Stop Global Warming" (W.W. Norton, 2008).

WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund forecast that sharply reducing greenhouse-gas emissions would slow global growth, but only minimally if economic policies were designed to encourage companies to adopt low-emission strategies. 
The policies needed to reduce emissions by 60% from 2002 would leave the global economy about 2.6% smaller than it otherwise would be in 2040, the IMF projected. Even so, the global economy would grow to about 2.3 times its current size between 2007 and 2040, the IMF said. 
"There are significant risks from climate change; damages could be severe," said IMF economist Natalia Tamirisa. "The costs of mitigation could be moderate provided that policies are well designed." The IMF highlighted the estimates on climate change in its flagship report, the semiannual World Economic Outlook released on Thursday. 
The IMF study helps give the imprimatur of the global financial establishment on the idea that dealing with climate change is affordable. While there is widespread agreement that the economic costs of rising global temperatures could be severe, there is little agreement on how much it would cost to try to head off some of the worst consequences. 
The study follows a series of reports by groups trying to frame the debate over how to curb emissions of greenhouse gases. A March analysis by the Bush administration found that the leading congressional proposal to control greenhouse-gas emissions could be implemented without significantly harming the nation's economic growth over the next two decades. But the analysis also forecast that gasoline prices and electric prices would rise more rapidly than they would otherwise. 
A Senate floor vote on that proposal -- sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and John Warner, a Virginia Republican -- is expected to occur within a few months. The bill would cap greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, factories, oil refineries and other polluters. Companies that exceeded the limits would have to buy credits from other companies that met them with room to spare. 
The three major presidential candidates -- Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and Republican John McCain -- back cap-and-trade proposals, though they differ in specifics. Senators Clinton and Obama would auction all emission allowances; Senator McCain favors giving away some credits and auctioning off the rest. 
Globally, the study could also help convince India and China to sign an agreement that would commit them to controlling emissions. The IMF study said that all countries need to agree to climate-change mitigation policies because a large percentage of emissions will come from big developing countries. 
A global price for emissions should be set, the IMF said. The study didn't choose between a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax, arguing that the effects of both are similar -­they raise the price of carbon emissions. The pricing policies must be "long-term and credible," the IMF said, in order to convince businesses to make necessary investments. 
Companies would have incentives to cut emissions in the least expensive way -- often by helping plants in China and India become more energy-efficient. "If China and India have access to technologies similar to those available in Europe and Japan, they could cut emissions dramatically by improving their intensity of energy use and by reducing their reliance on coal," the IMF study argued. Reducing emissions in rich countries could be far more costly. 
Rising temperatures would damage poor nations far more than rich ones, the IMF said, because poor ones often rely on agriculture and other climate-sensitive sectors. Poor countries, of course, also have less money to recover from droughts, hurricanes or tsunamis, which are projected to increase if temperatures around the world rise substantially. 
The IMF study examined the various ways that emission-reduction strategies would course through the global economy, by affecting exchange rates, trade flows, consumption and investment.

Abstract 
None available. 

Full Text 
Most sources of energy are beyond the pale in the Democratic Party, but nothing carries quite the moral stigma of coal. The latest excommunication is under way in Kansas, of all places, and it may be a forerunner of national political trends. 
Governor Kathleen Sebelius calls it "a moral obligation," as though she were opposing crimes against humanity. This is a reference to coal companies guilty of nothing more than attempting to provide power to consumers. But their misfortunes include emitting carbon dioxide into the current political atmosphere, and also the presence of Ms. Sebelius, who recently invented another way of enacting her preferred global-warming policies without legislation. 
No one disputes that Kansas needs more baseload energy capacity to meet growing demand, especially at peak times and in the more rural west. In 2006, Sunflower Electric proposed to add two new generators to one of its existing coal facilities. The plans met or exceeded every federal and state air-quality and environmental regulation, and included the latest pollution control technologies. 
But in October, one of Ms. Sebelius's cabinet secretaries, Roderick Bremby, denied Sunflower its permits. Using "emergency" discretion, he creatively ruled the expansion an imminent danger to the public -- because the estimated 11 million tons of greenhouse gases it would emit each year might contribute to climate change. It was the first time ever that such reasoning formed the sole basis for blocking a power project; and, in the absence of any state laws relating to carbon control, it amounted to a public policy putsch. 
Ms. Sebelius joined the green regulatory lobby that wants to unilaterally classify CO2 as an "air pollutant," though it has none of the qualities that have always defined the term under federal or state law. Her effort is also an opening charge for a national moratorium on new coal plants, which is backed by the likes of Democrats Harry Reid, Ed Markey and, needless to say, Al Gore. 
By wide bipartisan margins, the Kansas legislature passed a bill resurrecting the project and closing the "discretion" loophole, telling Ms. Sebelius to obey the rules on the books. She vetoed that measure late last month, which the legislature will try to override today, and the votes may come up a few short. 
The losers here are ordinary Kansans, who won't benefit from a reliable source of low-cost power and will pay higher electricity rates. The state is running up against the limits of its ability to provide electricity for its growing population and economy. The current generating fleet has an average age nearing 40 years and hence is less efficient (not to mention more polluting). 
Ms. Sebelius suggests commercial wind power as an alternative. The numbers suffice as rebuttal: Some three-quarters of Kansas electricity comes from coal-fired utilities. Currently all "renewables," including wind, account for 2%, at best. 
Ms. Sebelius is a Democratic wunderkind and her name is circulating for a cabinet post in an Obama Administration, maybe even Vice President. She's representative of the party's "no, nothing" wing, which knows only what energy it wants to ban or limit, not what it is going to offer in place. Coal provides more than half of U.S. electricity because it is cheap and abundant -- and viable. Wind turbines and the rest of the boutique alternatives are none of those, a reality that Democrats are going to have to square when they actually bother to pass a climate-change bill.

WASHINGTON States, Groups Sue EPA Over Car Emissions The legal battle over the Bush administration's resistance to regulating global-warming gases escalated as 18 states and a raft of environmental groups asked a federal court to 
order the Environmental Protection Agency to formally rule on whether carbon-dioxide emissions from automobiles threaten public health or welfare. 
Separately, a House committee voted to subpoena draft EPA documents that -- according to agency officials who were interviewed by congressional investigators -- show the agency concluded tentatively last year that such emissions threaten public welfare and should be regulated. The two actions -- coinciding with an international climate-change conference in Thailand -- are intended to heighten pressure on the Bush administration to regulate 
greenhouse-gas emissions, a year after the Supreme Court rejected administration arguments that the EPA lacks authority to do so. 
The suit filed by the states and environmental groups pertains only to carbon-dioxide emissions from automobiles. But it has the potential to affect a wide swath of U.S. 

industry. Legal experts say a determination by the EPA that carbon-dioxide emissions endanger public health or welfare would require the agency to draft regulations on 
refineries, power plants and many other large emitters. 
Last week, the EPA's administrator, Stephen Johnson, announced plans to seek public comment on possible regulation of greenhouse gases, setting in motion a process that 

would likely delay a so-called endangerment finding for an indefinite period. 

According to interviews conducted with senior EPA officials earlier this year by a congressional committee, the agency concluded late last year that carbon-dioxide emissions 
endanger public welfare and drafted a proposal to regulate such emissions from automobiles. 
The agency's draft endangerment finding was forwarded to the White House in December, according to the EPA officials who were interviewed. Since then, the EPA has declined 

to publish the finding. 
A spokesman for the EPA, Jonathan Shradar, said Wednesday the agency would review the lawsuit but noted the Supreme Court's ruling didn't set a deadline for determining 
whether greenhouse gases threaten health or welfare. 

UTAH 
Miners' Families File Suit 
In Collapse That Killed 6 
The families of six men killed at Utah's Crandall Canyon mine are suing the mine's owners, claiming the deaths were caused by an unsafe plan to harvest coal. 
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in Third District Court contends Murray Energy Corp. and its affiliates continued to mine using a risky technique last summer, despite a mountain 

"bounce" in March 2007. 

A thunderous collapse, so powerful it registered as a 3.9 earthquake, trapped the men in the mine Aug. 6. Their bodies remain entombed there. Three other men were killed 10 
days later trying to tunnel in to rescue the miners. 
Murray Energy attorney Kevin Anderson denied any wrongdoing by the company. 
In a report released Monday, the Labor Department's internal- inspection arm said the Mine Safety and Health Administration was negligent in protecting miners at the mine. 

MSHA disputed the finding. 

LOUISIANA 
Congressman's Brother 
Faces Bribery Charges 
The eldest brother and political strategist of indicted Rep. William Jefferson was charged with giving payoffs to a school-board president -- a bribery case apparently unrelated to the one against the congressman. 
In a federal indictment handed up Wednesday, Mose Jefferson is accused of giving $140,000 to help secure about $14 million in contracts to bring a computer-based teaching system to Orleans Parish schools. He is charged with bribery, money laundering and obstruction of justice.

Abstract 
Carbon-dioxide emissions reached 1.914 billion metric tons last year in the sectors covered by Europe's Emission Trading Scheme, according to an analysis of data by Oslo-based Point Carbon, a carbon market- research and consulting firm. According to an analysis of the EU data by Point Carbon, the German power sector is expected to emit 310 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2008. 

Full text 
The European Union's greenhouse-gas emissions from key industries rose 1.1% last year, despite its antipollution policies, demonstrating the difficulty in meeting international commitments to fight climate change. 
Carbon-dioxide emissions reached 1.914 billion metric tons last year in the sectors covered by Europe's Emission Trading Scheme, according to an analysis of data by Oslo-based Point Carbon, a carbon market- research and consulting firm. The data released Wednesday aren't complete, because some companies' results are still trickling in, but it represents about 93% of the total, according to the EU Web site. 
For the past three years, Europe has been trying to reduce emissions by imposing a market-based cap-and-trade system. Industries such as power generators, steel, cement and aluminum are supposed to cap the amount of carbon dioxide they spew. If they can't make their targets, they must buy permits to emit carbon on the open market. 
By forcing companies to buy and sell the right to pollute, Europe's system is supposed to give them a financial incentive to clean up their acts. It is also supposed to provide European countries with a way to meet their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations accord that set emissions-cutting targets for the 175 nations that ratified it for the period between this year and 2012. 
Some 11,500 factories, oil refineries, steel mills and other installations are covered by the EU scheme, accounting for about half of Europe's total emissions. There is still no limit on the other half, produced by everything from cars and planes to buildings and retail outlets. 
But the caps that the EU set for different industries turned out to be too high. As a result, instead of shrinking, as was originally envisioned, emissions in these industries have crept up by about 1% each year since the program began. 
Europe's struggle to make its cap-and-trade program work shows just how hard it will be for the industrialized world to achieve any meaningful reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Japan isn't faring any better: Its Kyoto targets call for it to reduce emissions by 6% below 1990 levels, but emissions are actually increasing there as well. 
The issue is taking on greater importance in the U.S., the world's biggest economy and still the largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. All three leading presidential candidates say they are in favor of establishing a cap-and-trade system similar to Europe's, and the Senate is expected to consider cap-and-trade bills this summer. 
Europe's cap-and-trade system has been plagued with design and implementation problems from the start. Chief among them: National governments issued too many carbon permits -- essentially a license to pollute -- to regulated industries. As a result, companies had no real incentive to revamp their factories. Regulators in Europe have tried to get the scheme back on track by forcing governments to ratchet down the number of permits they issue during the program's second phase, from 2008 to 2012. 
Although the scheme has so far failed to reduce emissions, it has spawned a fast-growing market for trading carbon permits. Last year, the value of all the carbon credits traded in Europe topped $40 billion, up 55% from the previous year. Hedge funds, investment banks and brokers trade carbon permits as they would any other commodity, like gold or oil. And while the data released Wednesday might fuel pessimistic predictions about the effectiveness of the scheme in holding back emissions, financial players were bullish about what it meant for the carbon market. 
Patrick Weber, a carbon trader for Allianz AG's investment-banking unit Dresdner Kleinwort in London, spent the day fielding phone calls from German utilities and industrial companies regulated by Kyoto. "We still think there will be a net shortage in carbon credits through 2012, so prices should go up from here," he said. 
The price for a carbon permit for delivery in December 2008 increased 4% to 23.45 euros ($36.58) at the close of trading Wednesday on the European Climate Exchange, up 93 European cents from Tuesday's close at 22.52 euros. 
Companies such as German utility RWE AG and steelmaker ArcelorMittal are expected to be big buyers of carbon credits in the next phase of the scheme, and an increase in carbon prices could sharply boost their cost of complying with Europe's carbon-emissions caps. 
According to an analysis of the EU data by Point Carbon, the German power sector is expected to emit 310 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2008. But emissions for the sector are capped at 236 million metric tons for 2008, meaning power companies like RWE and Eon AG will have to make major cuts to their emissions or buy carbon permits on the market. In previous years, power companies had more permits than they needed because of the design flaws in the scheme. 
"We see the same picture all across Europe," said Henrik Hasselknippe, analyst at Point Carbon. "The power sector will have to reduce its emissions either by switching from burning coal to natural gas, building renewable energy, or by buying massive amounts of carbon credits." 
For its part, RWE expects to have annual emissions of around 140 to 147 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2008 to 2012, but only anticipates being given 75 to 80 million tons worth of carbon permits. To make up the shortfall, RWE says it is upgrading its power plants, urging its customers to be more energy-efficient, starting a renewable-energy subsidiary and buying 18 million metric tons worth of carbon permits from projects done in the developing world. "We have an ambitious strategy," said an RWE official. 
Corrections & Amplifications 
The World Bank and the International Energy Agency rank the U.S. as the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, but other groups, including the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, say that China is now the largest emitter. An article Thursday on the European Union's greenhouse-gas emissions said the U.S. is the largest emitter but failed to note that there is disagreement on the rankings.

Abstract 
Jeff, I think you deserve a lion's share of the credit, or the blame, depending on your perspective, for really changing the way that business is thinking about environmental issues and global- warming issues. Living in Washington, it feels as though, in the energy sector in particular, part of people's business plans is to go to Washington and get legislation passed that requires people to buy their products. 

Full Text 
General Electric Co. Chairman and CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt has become one of the country's leading advocates of government-mandated caps on carbon emissions. Not because he's an environmentalist -- he says he isn't -- but because he feels government will impose those caps someday so business should get out in front on the issue. 
Mr. Immelt talked to The Wall Street Journal's Alan Murray and Kimberley A. Strassel. Here are edited excerpts from that discussion. 
ALAN MURRAY: Jeff, I think you deserve a lion's share of the credit, or the blame, depending on your perspective, for really changing the way that business is thinking about environmental issues and global- warming issues. In 2005, you launched Ecomagination and we had elephants dancing across our TV screens. And then last year you played an instrumental role in bringing together a group of CEOs to form USCAP [the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a group of corporations that have called for a U.S. emissions cap]. To me it almost felt unprecedented to say to the U.S. government, we have to put caps on global warming. Basically, regulate us, please. Why did you do it? 
JEFFREY IMMELT: The history of our company is one of bringing innovation to market. We saw the technology was there that could drive clean energy. More than half of the company is outside the U.S. We saw the emerging thinking around environmental technology and legislation. We saw seven states in the U.S. that had cap-and-trade systems already, and this impossible labyrinth of regulations coming our way. And we thought this was a way that we could get ahead of it and declare green is green. And that's really the driving force behind how we got started. 
MR. MURRAY: But you know what people wonder is: Do you do this because you personally, Jeff Immelt, believe that earth is heading for a crisis and you have a responsibility to deal with it? Do you do it because you believe that General Electric has the opportunity to make money selling green technologies, maybe more money than you make selling hydrocarbon-based technologies? Do you do it because it's great public relations? Do you do it because you think carbon caps are inevitable and you want to be at the table and have some effect? 
MR. IMMELT: I would say that I work for investors. I don't believe in hobbies. 
MR. MURRAY: This is not personal. 
MR. IMMELT: I don't think that CEO hobbies have any role in running companies. I'm an investor, I'm a capitalist and I'm a businessman. So I believe that I could generate earnings for my investors through technology. 
There's no percentage for any CEO in the world to run his or her business thinking that there are not going to be carbon caps someday. Because the day it becomes law, you're five years late. And you either get out ahead of these things or you get stomped by them. 
KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL: The Congressional Budget Office recently did a report about the leading climate bill in Congress, and they say that it will dramatically raise consumer prices and slow the economy. What effect will that have on GE's earnings? 
MR. IMMELT: These costs are going to be borne no matter what. I would say we're actually already paying for it. $110 oil, we're already paying for it. Costs are going to go up. 
The question is do we get ahead of it and bring these [clean] technologies down the learning curve ahead of time, or does it just get thrust on us in an incredibly impossible way? And that's what leaders have to decide. 
You can't get a coal plant permitted. There's no leadership about what we want to do. So where we are today, I would argue, is like the worst of all worlds. 
MS. STRASSEL: Living in Washington, it feels as though, in the energy sector in particular, part of people's business plans is to go to Washington and get legislation passed that requires people to buy their products. So one question I would have is how much of Ecomagination is actually underwritten by tax subsidies? And how, as a private investor, do you justify having public taxpayers get into this business? 
MR. IMMELT: It's a great question, but I would say that government tax policy, or economic policy, ought to reflect the benefits to the economy and what the government wants to have happen. 
Think about something like the production tax credit [which gives tax credits to alternative-energy companies]. One of the reasons the government wanted to use it was to get more renewable energy in place. We acquired our wind business in 2001. The cost for electricity and wind was about 16 cents, 17 cents a kilowatt-hour. Now it's half that. The production tax credits worked. 
MS. STRASSEL: Do you think people would buy it without the tax credit? 
MR. IMMELT: Someday. But I think on this subject we worship false idols. I'm in the commercial aviation business. Guess how we got into that business? Because the 

Department of Defense in World War II paid for military engines that helped fund the commercial aviation industry. 
My entertainment business is regulated, my financial-service business is regulated, my appliance business is regulated, my health- care business is regulated. So for some 
reason we decide that energy is the one industry in the world where basically the only policy should be the price of the barrel of oil today. I think that's crazy. 

MR. MURRAY: You've been working for three years trying to reduce GE's carbon footprint. Based on that experience, what do you think when you hear people say we are going 

to reduce global carbon emissions by 80% by the year 2050? Is that realistic? 
MR. IMMELT: I'd say you better start today. I've worked for GE for 26 years. In 26 years in my health-care business, which is about a $20 billion business, we're on our eighth 
iteration of technology. [But] I still sell the same energy products I sold 26 years ago. So there's been no investor climate to drive technology in this field. We haven't built a 
nuclear power plant in 25 years. We haven't built coal gasification in 25 years. So we better get on it. 

Now, what trajectory it goes on, is it 80% by 2050, is it 60% by 2050? I think it can be a big number, but technology is the answer. And, as a country, we've become so afraid 

and averse to allowing the entrepreneurial forces of technology to take place. And in energy they can have a huge impact as time goes on. 
MR. MURRAY: You mentioned the competitive dynamic in the world today, where we face extreme competition from emerging countries in Asia, and elsewhere in the world. 
Does it make sense for you to say, OK, in the U.S., we're going to impose a cap on our businesses, but there's going to be no such cap in China, there's going to be no such cap 
in India? 

MR. IMMELT: I think what USCAP envisioned, and what legislation will try to do, is to have some market-clearing mechanism for what's going to happen globally. But, I've got to 
tell you that we'll do, I don't know, $15 billion, $16 billion of Ecomagination products this year. Probably $2 or $3 billion will go to China and India. 
So it's a great opportunity for this country to develop technologies that are going to be used on a global basis. 
MR. MURRAY: Eventually be used over there. 
MR. IMMELT: I think sooner rather than eventually. 

MS. STRASSEL: When you go to Washington and you talk to the powers that be, do you talk to them about the importance of nuclear power? What's the response you get? 
MR. IMMELT: What do you do about storage? OK, I think it's a big issue, but I say to them: We haven't built a plant in 25 years. What capitalist in their right mind would spend 
one penny on storage if you guys aren't going to build any plants? You've got to be kidding me. 

If nothing happens in the U.S. today, it's going to be gas and wind. I don't care because we make gas and wind. That's OK. 
MR. MURRAY: Can gas and wind do it? Can they get you where you need to be? 
MR. IMMELT: I'm a big believer in diversification. Let's get control over our future because we can have coal, we can have nuclear, we can have gas, we can have wind, we can 

have solar. 
MR. MURRAY: How do you feel about how this is being discussed in the presidential election right now? 
MR. IMMELT: Do I have to answer that? 
MR. MURRAY: Yes, you do. 
MR. IMMELT: From a competitiveness standpoint, it's really education, health care, energy and financial policies that encourage innovation. Energy is one of the three or four 

things that actually is really important. Words like energy independence, things like that, just are naive. I'd like to hear what they want to do on a cap-and- trade plan. What they think about nuclear power. Where we're going with clean exploration. 
There's a technical renaissance that this country can go through that can make us a real leader. 
MS. STRASSEL: I hate to sound like the capitalist Luddite in the room. But why doesn't the market get to sort this out? If people really believed this is such a huge issue, why 
won't they pay what needs to be paid for solar, for wind, for ethanol, for all of these diverse energy products? 

Why, again, do we have to have some sort of centralized program? 

MR. IMMELT: There's such a time discrepancy in this industry that's unique to the industry that by the time you decide pollution is a problem, by the time you decide that there 
is real shortage, by the time there's a grid in place in this country that actually facilitates low-cost energy distribution, microturbines, things like that, it ain't going to happen. 
The government has its hands in almost every industry we're in, whether you want to say it or not, and there's tax deductions for home mortgages. Do people think that the 

housing industry is government- regulated? You bet it is.

The world's economy is acquiring a new energy addiction: biofuels. 
Crop-based fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are quietly becoming a crucial component of the global energy supply, despite growing concerns about their impact on the environment and world food prices. 
Biofuels production is rising rapidly, while other fuel sources are failing to keep pace with demand. As a result, biofuels are making up a larger portion of the world's energy-supply gap than many analysts expected. That means the debate over biofuels probably will shift from whether they are good or bad to the more difficult question of how to make sure their production keeps growing -- without wreaking economic and environmental havoc. 
Global production of biofuels is rising annually by the equivalent of about 300,000 barrels of oil a day. That goes a long way toward meeting the growing demand for oil, which last year rose by about 900,000 barrels a day. 
Without biofuels, which can be refined to produce fuels much like the ones made from petroleum, oil prices would be even higher. Merrill Lynch commodity strategist Francisco Blanch says that oil and gasoline prices would be about 15% higher if biofuel producers weren't increasing their output. That would put oil at more than $115 a barrel, instead of the current price of around $102. U.S. gasoline prices would have surged to more than $3.70 a gallon, compared with an average of a little more than $3.25 today. 
Biofuels are playing "a critical role" in satisfying world demand, says Fatih Birol, chief economist of the Paris-based International Energy Agency. Without them, "it would be much more difficult to balance global oil markets," he said. 
The implications are huge. After an initial burst of enthusiasm in 2005 and 2006, environmentalists and some economists now blame biofuels for a host of global problems. These include a sharp jump in the price of corn and other biofuel crops, which has triggered a rise in global inflation and protests in poor nations. 
Many environmentalists now believe biofuels contribute substantially to greenhouse gases -- those responsible for global warming -- instead of reducing them, as was previously believed, in part because farmers clear forest land to grow biofuel crops. Scientists say deforestation causes a large, quick release of carbon into the atmosphere when existing plant life is destroyed. 
International agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, have called on governments to deal with problems caused by biofuels, and some countries have started to rethink their support for the fuels. But cutting back on them won't be easy. Just as developing nations continue to gobble up coal, despite the high environmental cost, Western consumers seem to want whatever it takes to ensure enough fuel for their cars. 
As global energy consumption grows, "there will be pressure to continue relying on these sources regardless" of their negative impacts, says Jeff Brown, a Singapore-based economist at consulting firm FACTS Global Energy Group. "The only other choice is higher [oil] prices." 
It's possible newer biofuels will be developed that pose fewer problems. In India and Africa, farmers are expanding production of jatropha, an inedible shrub that is grown on marginal land and requires relatively little water. There also is rising interest in miscanthus, a perennial grass grown in Britain and elsewhere that can be used to generate energy without driving up the cost of crops needed for human consumption. 
Still, most farmers prefer to grow biofuel crops they are familiar with, such as corn. And most "second-generation" biofuels are coming on more slowly than many experts had hoped, meaning it might be several years, if ever, before they are viable on a large scale. 
It is also possible that "first-generation" biofuels like palm oil- derived biodiesel will run into constraints that would make it difficult to boost their production. The cost of raw materials like palm oil has shot up over the past year, cutting into profits for biofuel producers and forcing some to idle refineries or cancel new ones. It is also unclear whether there is enough land or water left to keep boosting biofuels' production at their current rate of increase. 
But a slowdown in biofuel production would only tighten world energy markets -- and further highlight the world's dependence on the fuels, especially as producers of traditional crude oil struggle to crank up their supply. 
Earlier this month, Exxon Mobil Corp. said it planned to boost capital spending by several billion dollars in 2008 to roughly $25 billion, and yet production levels will likely stay about the same this year. Mr. Blanch at Merrill Lynch says he expects new oil from producers outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to taper off to as little as 300,000 barrels a day by 2011 -- about the equivalent of today's annual increase in biofuels production. 
Production from OPEC is tougher to forecast, in part because of the unpredictable political forces that shape the group's decisions. Last year, however, the cartel's output, including that of new members Angola and Ecuador, declined by about 400,000 barrels a day, according to the IEA. OPEC has lately decided to hold production at its current levels despite oil prices in excess of $100 a barrel. 
All of that can only mean one thing: With so many challenges ahead for increasing oil supplies, the world will have to get used to relying on biofuels -- or find yet another alternative, at a time when there aren't many.

Abstract 
The need to curb global warming limits the usefulness of some resources -- coal, for one, which emits greenhouse gases that most scientists say contribute to climate change. 

Full text 
Now and then across the centuries, powerful voices have warned that human activity would overwhelm the earth's resources. The Cassandras always proved wrong. Each time, there were new resources to discover, new technologies to propel growth. 
Today the old fears are back. 
Although a Malthusian catastrophe is not at hand, the resource constraints foreseen by the Club of Rome are more evident today than at any time since the 1972 publication of the think tank's famous book, "The Limits of Growth." Steady increases in the prices for oil, wheat, copper and other commodities -- some of which have set record highs this month -- are signs of a lasting shift in demand as yet unmatched by rising supply. 
As the world grows more populous -- the United Nations projects eight billion people by 2025, up from 6.6 billion today -- it also is growing more prosperous. The average person is consuming more food, water, metal and power. Growing numbers of China's 1.3 billion people and India's 1.1 billion are stepping up to the middle class, adopting the high-protein diets, gasoline-fueled transport and electric gadgets that developed nations enjoy. 
The result is that demand for resources has soared. If supplies don't keep pace, prices are likely to climb further, economic growth in rich and poor nations alike could suffer, and some fear violent conflicts could ensue. 
Some of the resources now in great demand have no substitutes. In the 18th century, England responded to dwindling timber supplies by shifting to abundant coal. But there can be no such replacement for arable land and fresh water. 
The need to curb global warming limits the usefulness of some resources -- coal, for one, which emits greenhouse gases that most scientists say contribute to climate change. Soaring food consumption stresses the existing stock of arable land and fresh water. 
"We're living in an era where the technologies that have empowered high living standards and 80-year life expectancies in the rich world are now for almost everybody," says economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, which focuses on sustainable development with an emphasis on the world's poor. "What this means is that not only do we have a very large amount of economic activity right now, but we have pent-up potential for vast increases [in economic activity] as well." The world cannot sustain that level of growth, he contends, without new technologies. 
Americans already are grappling with higher energy and food prices. Although crude prices have dropped in recent days, there's a growing consensus among policy makers and industry executives that this isn't just a temporary surge in prices. Some of these experts, but not all of them, foresee a long-term upward shift in prices for oil and other commodities. 
Today's dire predictions could prove just as misguided as yesteryear's. 
"Clearly we'll have more and more problems, as more and more [people] are going to be richer and richer, using more and more stuff," says Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish statistician who argues that the global-warming problem is overblown. "But smartness will outweigh the extra resource use." 
Some constraints might disappear with greater global cooperation. Where some countries face scarcity, others have bountiful supplies of resources. New seed varieties and better irrigation techniques could open up arid regions to cultivation that today are only suitable as hardscrabble pasture; technological breakthroughs, like cheaper desalination or efficient ways to transmit electricity from unpopulated areas rich with sunlight or wind, could brighten the outlook. 
In the past, economic forces spurred solutions. Scarcity of resource led to higher prices, and higher prices eventually led to conservation and innovation. Whale oil was a popular source of lighting in the 19th century. Prices soared in the middle of the century, and people sought other ways to fuel lamps. In 1846, Abraham Gesner began developing kerosene, a cleaner-burning alternative. By the end of the century, whale oil cost less than it did in 1831. 
A similar pattern could unfold again. But economic forces alone may not be able to fix the problems this time around. Societies as different as the U.S. and China face stiff political resistance to boosting water prices to encourage efficient use, particularly from farmers. When resources such as water are shared across borders, establishing a pricing framework can be thorny. And in many developing nations, food-subsidy programs make it less likely that rising prices will spur change. 
This troubles some economists who used to be skeptical of the premise of "The Limits to Growth." As a young economist 30 years ago, Joseph Stiglitz said flatly: "There is not a persuasive case to be made that we face a problem from the exhaustion of our resources in the short or medium run." 
Today, the Nobel laureate is concerned that oil is underpriced relative to the cost of carbon emissions, and that key resources such as water are often provided free. "In the absence of market signals, there's no way the market will solve these problems," he says. "How do we make people who have gotten something for free start paying for it? That's really hard. If our patterns of living, our patterns of consumption are imitated, as others are striving to do, the world probably is not viable." 
Dennis Meadows, one of the authors of "The Limits to Growth," says the book was too optimistic in one respect. The authors assumed that if humans stopped harming the environment, it would recover slowly. Today, he says, some climate-change models suggest that once tipping points are passed, environmental catastrophe may be inevitable even "if you quit damaging the environment." 
One danger is that governments, rather than searching for global solutions to resource constraints, will concentrate on grabbing share. 
China has been funding development in Africa, a move some U.S. officials see as a way for it to gain access to timber, oil and other resources. India, once a staunch supporter of the democracy movement in military-run Myanmar, has inked trade agreements with the natural- resource rich country. The U.S., European Union, Russia and China are all vying for the favor of natural-gas-abundant countries in politically unstable Central Asia. 
Competition for resources can get ugly. A record drought in the Southeast intensified a dispute between Alabama, Georgia and Florida over water from a federal reservoir outside Atlanta. A long-running fight over rights to the Cauvery River between the Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu led to 25 deaths in 1991. 
Economists Edward Miguel of the University of California at Berkeley and Shanker Satyanath and Ernest Sergenti of New York University have found that declines in rainfall are associated with civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. Sierra Leone, for example, which saw a sharp drop in rainfall in 1990, plunged into civil war in 1991. 
The rise of China and India already has changed the world economy in lasting ways, from the flows of global capital to the location of manufacturing. But they remain poor societies with growing appetites. 
Nagpur in central India once was known as one of the greenest metropolises in the country. Over the past decade, Nagpur, now one of at least 40 Indian cities with more than a million people, has grown to roughly 2.5 million from 1.7 million. Local roads have turned into a mess of honking cars, motorbikes and wandering livestock under a thick soup of foul air. 
"Sometimes if I see something I like, I just buy it," says Sapan Gajbe, 32 years old, a dentist shopping for an air conditioner at Nagpur's Big Bazaar mall. A month earlier, he bought his first car, a $9,000 Maruti Zen compact. 
In 2005, China had 15 passenger cars for every 1,000 people, close to the 13 cars per 1,000 that Japan had in 1963. Today, Japan has 447 passenger cars per 1,000 residents, 57 million in all. If China ever reaches that point, it would have 572 million cars -- 70 million shy of the number of cars in the entire world today. 
China consumes 7.9 million barrels of oil a day. The U.S., with less than one quarter as many people, consumes 20.7 million barrels. "Demand will be going up, but it will be constrained by supply," ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer James Mulva has told analysts. "I don't think we are going to see the supply going over 100 million barrels a day, and the reason is: Where is all that going to come from?" 
Says Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel: "The idea that we might have to move on to other sources of energy -- you don't have to buy into the Club of Rome agenda for that." The world can adjust to dwindling oil production by becoming more energy efficient and by moving to nuclear, wind and solar power, he says, although such transitions can be slow and costly. 
There are no substitutes for water, no easy alternatives to simple conservation. Despite advances, desalination remains costly and energy intensive. Throughout the world, water is often priced too low. Farmers, the biggest users, pay less than others, if they pay at all. 
In California, the subsidized rates for farmers have become a contentious political issue. Chinese farmers receive water at next to no cost, accounting for 65% of all water used in the country. 
In Pondhe, an Indian village of about 1,000 on a barren plateau east of Mumbai, water wasn't a problem until the 1970s, when farmers began using diesel-powered pumps to transport water farther and faster. Local wells used to overflow during the monsoon season, recalls Vasantrao Wagle, who has farmed in the area for four decades. Today, they top off about 10 feet below the surface, and drop even lower during the dry season. "Even when it rains a lot, we aren't getting enough water," he says. 
Parched northern China has been drawing down groundwater supplies. In Beijing, water tables have dropped hundreds of feet. In nearby Hebei province, once large Baiyangdian Lake has shrunk, and survives mainly because the government has diverted water into it from the Yellow River. 
Climate change is likely to intensify water woes. Shifting weather patterns will be felt "most strongly through changes in the distribution of water around the world and its seasonal and annual variability," according to the British government report on global warming led by Nicholas Stern. Water shortages could be severe in parts Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe and Latin America, the report said. 
China's farmers need water because China needs food. Production of rice, wheat and corn topped out at 441.4 million tons in 1998 and hasn't hit that level since. Sea water has leaked into depleted aquifers in the north, threatening to turn land barren. Illegal seizures of farmland by developers are widespread. The government last year declared that it would not permit arable land to drop below 120 million hectares (296 million acres), and said it would beef up enforcement of land-use rules. 
The farmland squeeze is forcing difficult choices. After disastrous floods in 1998, China started paying some farmers to abandon marginal farmland and plant trees. That "grain­to-green" program was intended to reverse the deforestation and erosion that exacerbated the floods. Last August, the government stopped expanding the program, citing the need for farmland and the cost. 
A growing taste for meat and other higher-protein food in the developing world is boosting demand and prices for feed grains. "There are literally hundreds of millions of people...who are making the shift to protein, and competition for food world-wide is a new reality," says William Doyle, chief executive officer of fertilizer- maker Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan. 
It takes nearly 10 pounds of grain to produce one pound of pork -- the staple meat in China -- and more than double that to produce a pound of beef, according to Vaclav Smil, a University of Manitoba geographer who studies food, energy and environment trends. The number of calories in the Chinese diet from meat and other animal products has more than doubled since 1990, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. But China still lags Taiwan when it comes to per-capita pork consumption. Matching Taiwan would increase China's annual pork consumption by 11 billion pounds -- as much pork as Americans eat in six or seven months. 
The 1972 warnings by the Club of Rome -- a nongovernmental think tank now based in Hamburg that brings together academics, business executives, civil servants and politicians to grapple with a wide range of global issues -- struck a chord because they came as oil prices were rising sharply. Oil production in the continental U.S. had peaked, sparking fears that energy demand had outstripped supply. Over time, America became more energy efficient, overseas oil production rose and prices fell. 
The dynamic today appears different. So far, the oil industry has failed to find major new sources of crude. Absent major finds, prices are likely to keep rising, unless consumers cut back. Taxes are one way to curb their appetites. In Western Europe and Japan, for example, where gas taxes are higher than in the U.S., per capita consumption is much lower. 
New technology could help ease the resource crunch. Advances in agriculture, desalination and the clean production of electricity, among other things, would help. 
But Mr. Stiglitz, the economist, contends that consumers eventually will have to change their behavior even more than then did after the 1970s oil shock. He says the world's traditional definitions and measures of economic progress -- based on producing and consuming ever more -- may have to be rethought. 
In years past, the U.S., Europe and Japan have proven adept at adjusting to resource constraints. But history is littered with examples of societies believed to have suffered Malthusian crises: the Mayans of Central America, the Anasazi of the U.S. Southwest, and the people of Easter Island. 
Those societies, of course, lacked modern science and technology. Still, their inability to overcome resource challenges demonstrates the perils of blithely believing things will work out, says economist James Brander at the University of British Columbia, who has studied Easter Island. 
"We need to look seriously at the numbers and say: Look, given what we're consuming now, given what we know about economic incentives, given what we know about price signals, what is actually plausible?" says Mr. Brander. 
Indeed, the true lesson of Thomas Malthus, an English economist who died in 1834, isn't that the world is doomed, but that preservation of human life requires analysis and then tough action. Given the history of England, with its plagues and famines, Malthus had good cause to wonder if society was "condemned to a perpetual oscillation between happiness and misery." That he was able to analyze that "perpetual oscillation" set him and his time apart from England's past. And that capacity to understand and respond meant that the world was less Malthusian thereafter.

TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius vetoed a bill aiming to remove a roadblock to the building of two coal-fired power plants in southwest Kansas. 
The bill also would reduce the power of the state's secretary of health and environment. Gov. Sebelius objected strongly to the idea. 
In October, the secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment took the unusual step of citing global warming as the basis for blocking a major coal-fired power 

project proposed by Sunflower Electric Power Corp. The decision provoked outrage from coal producers. 
A majority of the Kansas Legislature sided with the coal interests, prompting the bill, which would overturn the official's decision and strip him of much of his power. 
Gov. Sebelius's administration noted that the two plants proposed by Sunflower could produce 11 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. Many scientists link carbon dioxide to 

global warming. 
But many legislators saw the decision to block the project as arbitrary. 
Overriding Gov. Sebelius's veto takes two-thirds majorities in both houses.

Abstract 
A group backed by a major coal producer printed newspaper ads alleging that Mr. Bremby's decision benefits men like Vladimir Putin, Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by forcing Kansas to "import more natural gas from countries like Russia, Venezuela and Iran." In the absence of national regulations governing carbon-dioxide emissions, state officials are stepping into the void, proposing their own limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 

Full text 
WASHINGTON -- Rod Bremby doesn't have the star power of Al Gore or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but his decision to block a permit for two big coal-fired power plants in Kansas has put him at center stage in the national debate over energy and the environment. 
Last fall, Mr. Bremby, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, took the unusual step of citing global warming as the basis for blocking a major coal-fired power project. Legal experts said they couldn't recall another case where a regulator at either the state or federal level has held up such a project solely over concerns about greenhouse gases. 
The decision provoked outrage from coal producers. A lawsuit is pending, and the Kansas Supreme Court has agreed to weigh in. A group backed by a major coal producer printed newspaper ads alleging that Mr. Bremby's decision benefits men like Vladimir Putin, Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by forcing Kansas to "import more natural gas from countries like Russia, Venezuela and Iran." (The U.S. doesn't currently import natural gas from those countries, according to the U.S.'s Energy Information Administration.) 
A majority of the Kansas Legislature has sided with the coal interests, passing legislation this month that would overturn Mr. Bremby's decision and strip him of much of his power. That triggered a confrontation with the state's governor, Kathleen Sebelius, who is threatening a veto. 
"Kansas is ground zero in the fight over the future of coal," says Frank Maisano, a Washington-based spokesman for developers of coal- fired plants. Bruce Nilles, an attorney who heads the Sierra Club's campaign against coal, calls Mr. Bremby's decision "a watershed moment." 
Mr. Bremby says that rejecting the plants was "extremely difficult." The project would bring $3.6 billion in investment to the state. His own staff recommended approving it. But Mr. Bremby says it would have been "irresponsible" to ignore emerging information about the contribution of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to climate change and "the potential harm to our environment and health if we do nothing." 
His action also highlights a growing concern for U.S. industry. In the absence of national regulations governing carbon-dioxide emissions, state officials are stepping into the void, proposing their own limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. As Congress weighs proposals to enact a national cap on carbon-dioxide emissions, members are debating how much leeway to allow states to pursue their own greenhouse-gas limits. 
Mr. Bremby's decision has delighted politicians in Washington who want to curb U.S. reliance on coal, the source of about half the country's electricity. Earlier this month, Democrats called him to Washington to testify before a congressional committee on global warming and present a counterpoint to President Bush's top air- pollution regulator, Stephen Johnson. Mr. Johnson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has declined for months to publicly declare greenhouse gases a threat to public health or welfare. 
The 48-year-old Mr. Bremby doesn't have a law degree or a long history in climate-change politics. Before becoming Kansas' top health and environmental regulator, he was an assistant city manager in Lawrence, Kan., where his most extensive environmental work was controlling storm-water runoff and pesticide use in local parks. 
Mr. Bremby's critics say he acted unlawfully by unilaterally altering public policy in the absence of federal or state laws governing carbon-dioxide emissions. A major reason why Kansans enjoy low electricity costs compared with the national average is that three-quarters of their electricity comes from coal-fired generating plants, according to the EIA. If Mr. Bremby's decision stands, his critics say, it will lead to higher energy costs for consumers, while doing nothing to address Kansas' older, more inefficient coal-fired plants. 
"For an unelected person to decide on his own to make this kind of decision without any input from the legislative branch is a huge mistake," says Steve Morris, president of Kansas' state Senate. "When you hear about China putting a new coal plant on line every week and so many other sources of pollution around, to try to single out one [project] as the magic bullet to offset the emissions of tens of thousands of other emissions producers doesn't make a lot of sense." 
Despite their large carbon footprint, the plants also would have emitted less carbon dioxide on a kilowatt-hour basis than any coal- fired plant in Kansas. The plants' developer had planned to partially offset their emissions by capturing their carbon-dioxide emissions and using them to grow algae. The algae would then be used for a number of purposes, including to make biodiesel, an alternative to petroleum. 
But, Mr. Bremby points out, most of the energy generated by the plants would have gone outside the state. In making his decision, he says, he was influenced by "a lot of things [that] were moving at the same time." They included a Supreme Court ruling in April that carbon- dioxide is a pollutant, emerging scientific evidence about climate change and a joint letter from attorneys general for six states, warning him that the proposed plants' carbon-dioxide emissions would cancel out their own states' carbon-dioxide reductions. 
That scenario, Mr. Bremby says, seemed "absurd," given that his state has only 2.7 million inhabitants, compared with 45 million in the other affected states. "If appointed officials only did what they're directed to do by policy makers, without [heeding] science or laws, they'd be just hacks," Mr. Bremby says. He also notes that two months before his decision, the Kansas Energy Council -- a group that advises the state on energy policy and that includes half a dozen senior legislators -- declined to endorse either a cap or a tax on carbon-dioxide emissions. 
"No one was dealing with it," Mr. Bremby says of man-made carbon- dioxide emissions in his state. 
Some of Mr. Bremby's opponents accuse him of kowtowing to his boss, Gov. Sebelius. A fast-rising star in Democratic Party politics, Ms. Sebelius had publicly opposed the project. Mr. Bremby says that he never discussed the plants with her before his decision and that her views didn't influence him. A spokesman for Gov. Sebelius says the governor didn't attempt to sway Mr. Bremby. 
In the absence of any state laws regulating greenhouse gases, Mr. Bremby has prodded Kansas' utilities to reduce their carbon-dioxide emissions voluntarily. Last month, he secured a commitment from Kansas' biggest utility, Westar Energy Inc., to measure its greenhouse gases and find ways to reduce them. 
But the company's agreement doesn't set specific emissions targets. And until the federal government regulates greenhouse gases, Mr. Bremby says, his state will be limited in its ability to address carbon-dioxide emissions. "I can't do anything about what's going on in China," Mr. Bremby says. "But I know this decision means we [in Kansas] won't be contributing to that impact of climate change."

Last week, when oil was hovering around $110 a barrel and American motorists were bracing for $4 a gallon gasoline come summer, Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr offered a timely reminder of how poor our forward vision is when it comes to energy and technology. 
Forecasting future energy prices and demand is "like sitting around in 1994 and forecasting [demand for] Web browsers," Mr. Doerr said at The Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference last week. Mr. Doerr would know. He and his company, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, had a front-row seat (and did very, very well) during the Internet revolution created by the Netscape browser. 
In other words, no one knows whether Mr. Doerr and others in Silicon Valley's "clean tech" movement will succeed in their effort to do for the way we fuel cars what Netscape or Google did for the way we shop and collect information. Silicon Valley's clean-technology capitalists are bubbling with big ideas for reordering the $6 trillion global energy market. 
Mr. Doerr cautions "changing consumer behavior is the key. We've only taken this issue to the head of Main Street. We haven't walked down Main Street." 
I would add, we haven't driven, either. 
Within the next year or two, Americans are going to be pushed as never before to live without burning so much oil, particularly in their cars. This is partly because all three presidential candidates support proposals to raise the price of emitting carbon -- a geeky way of saying burning gasoline to drive or using coal to power the house. 
It is wrong to say that the climate-change argument is over; there is a large cadre of serious people who don't accept that man-made CO2 is a real problem. From a political perspective, it appears that doing nothing is no longer an option in the face of skyrocketing oil prices, energy security concerns and environmental worries. 
We don't have to wait for the presidential election to feel the effect of the new reality. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the world commodity markets are exacting a "carbon tax" of their own, payable at your local service station. 
Lots of people have grand visions for freeing transportation from oil. There is even a big "X-Prize" being offered to someone who can design a successful 100-mile-per-gallon car. 
The problem -- made clear during presentations by an impressive cadre of business leaders, technology visionaries and politicians at this conference in Santa Barbara, Calif. -- is inertia. 
Consider the inertia facing the car business. Daimler AG Chairman Dieter Zetsche and General Motors Corp. Vice Chairman Bob Lutz both have impressive green technology stories to tell. 
Mr. Zetsche has an S-Class diesel with a "mild hybrid" electric boost ready to roll that he expects will average 44 mpg. Mr. Lutz has mobilized teams at GM to transform the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid from a show car with a press release that said it could run as many as 40 miles on electricity alone to a real car that can run for 40 miles on electricity alone. 
Fabulous, except for this: These vehicles could turn out to be very limited-volume and relatively expensive exercises. Mr. Lutz expressed little confidence that ordinary Americans who buy the bulk of GM's cars are prepared to pay big premiums for low-carbon cars. "Unless consumers are feeling pain in the wallet, it's not going to work," Mr. Lutz said. 
People aren't likely to embrace expensive, new and unfamiliar automotive technology without a big economic push. "The least efficient way to reduce carbon dioxide is doing it through the vehicle," Mr. Zetsche says. Reducing how much people drive, and cutting the energy consumed in houses, is a better way to cut the amount of carbon we consume. 
Could ethanol ride to the rescue to fuel the cars we know and like today without the guilt and cost of feeding more cash to the global oil business? Not soon. Silicon Valley ethanol evangelist Vinod Khosla says it will be 10 years before ethanol distilled from waste products (not food grains) will affect the price of oil. But he complains that he needs "the oil industry to come along" and put in more pumps to dispense 85% ethanol. In other words, he is straining to overcome the inertia of the service-station industry's status quo. 
Top advisers to the three main presidential candidates wrapped a similar message in a quite civil and substantive debate over energy policy. Putting the U.S. economy on a course to produce less carbon -- via a government system of carbon caps -- "is going to require a kind of social commitment the likes of which we haven't seen since World War II," said Jason Grumet, an adviser to Sen. Barack Obama. All of today's candidates are committed to some form of carbon cap. 
With sufficient force, stationary objects do move. As gasoline prices have risen, compact cars have started to grow as a share of total vehicles purchased by American consumers from 23.8% in 2000 to 33.9% this year, according to Power Information Network data. Since January 2007, the share of four-cylinder engines has risen to 40% of new vehicles from 33.6%, while the share of eight- and six-cylinder engines has declined. That isn't a revolution, but it isn't more of the same. 
Mr. Doerr and his Silicon Valley compatriots have found that, with the right levers and sufficient persistence, big rocks can be made to roll down hills. Just don't expect it to happen in time to stop you from cursing the gas pump on your way to the beach on Memorial Day.

The Cassandras of global warming blame President Bush for running a faith-based, not science-based, presidency. But it's Mr. Bush's successor who, by embracing the fight against global warming, will have to make the greatest leap of faith. 
All three viable candidates for the presidency -- Sens. John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama -- have endorsed a so-called cap- and-trade system for carbon emissions. 
That isn't just a sharp turnabout from the current administration's policy; it also could herald the biggest new regulatory initiative to be adopted in the U.S. in decades. 
The idea is a response to strong science showing carbon emissions contribute to the earth's warming. There's no science, however, that can accurately predict how much economic pain will be caused as a result of their proposals. An analysis published Friday by the Bush administration concluded that carbon emissions could be capped without significantly harming the nation's economic growth over the next two decades. But the report also found that such a step could lead to sharp increases in electricity and gasoline prices. 
All three presidential hopefuls would cap emissions at a certain overall level. Anyone wishing to emit more than their cap would have to buy pollution permits from someone emitting less. The total number of permits would be ratcheted down over time. Sens. Clinton and Obama both say they would cut emissions 80% by the year 2050. Sen. McCain aims for a slightly lower 65% target. 
Whether these goals can be met without dire economic dislocation is a matter of conjecture. 
Last week, at The Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference, optimists abounded. The business executives, entrepreneurs and policy experts who gathered in Santa Barbara, Calif., for the two-day conference mostly thought new technologies could make the task a relatively painless one. Seventy-five percent of those in attendance said the candidates' goals were "feasible"; only 25% said they weren't. 
The consensus was that a cap-and-trade system would spark innovation that Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist John Doerr called "the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century." 
The optimists may be right. But it's prudent to consider the possibility that they might be wrong. 
Let's be clear: a carbon cap-and-trade system is really just a tax, of indeterminate size, by a different name. In effect, it taxes carbon emitters however much it takes to achieve the emissions goal. 
Sens. Clinton and Obama have rejected calls from utilities and other businesses to "allocate" the initial polluting rights based on a company's current emissions. Instead, they want to auction off all the pollution rights, making the worst polluters pay a bundle just to keep operating. (Sen. McCain is less clear on this point.) 
Duke Energy CEO James Rogers, who was one of the first in his industry to endorse cap-and-trade legislation, complained that for a coal-fired utility like his, the auction approach is tantamount to starting a game of strip poker with no clothes on. 
In the end, of course, consumers will pay this bill, as business passes the costs on. The result could be a heavy new burden on people already feeling the pain of stagnant wage growth and soaring energy prices. 
For now, that pain may seem pretty hypothetical to most voters. They are willing to give candidates kudos for getting serious about global warming. At the same time, candidates are using the tens of billions of dollars they hope to raise from auctioning off permits to hypothetically pay for other costly campaign proposals. 
That's a neat trick, but probably not a wise one. Any money raised from auctioning off emission rights ought to be devoted to solving the energy problem, encouraging basic research and cushioning the blow for displaced workers and disadvantaged consumers. 
Is there an alternative to what the candidates are proposing? If you believe the Earth's future is seriously endangered, probably not. Certainly, the status quo isn't very satisfactory, as carbon-dioxide emissions continue to grow at a startling rate. 
General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told the conference that current government policy, with its mish-mash of unfocused subsidies and contradictory state and federal policies, is a "certain kind of hell." Others in the audience echoed his sentiment. 
But with a carbon cap now likely, it's probably time for everyone to be more honest about the costs and the downside economic risks. Obama adviser Jason Grumet came closest when he told the group: "This is going to require a kind of social commitment the likes of which we haven't seen in this country since World War II."

Natural Gas Rides High, for Now; Prices May Ease As New Supplies Reach the Market

Abstract 
The price of gas hit $9.868 per million British thermal units Friday after topping $10 earlier last week, as investors spooked by the stock markets and worries about the U.S. economy poured money into commodities like oil and gold. 

Full text 
Natural-gas prices are near two-year highs and outpacing price increases for oil, driving up costs for companies and consumers. 
But many market watchers predict a fall in coming months, as new supplies come to market following years of flat production. 
The price of gas hit $9.868 per million British thermal units Friday after topping $10 earlier last week, as investors spooked by the stock markets and worries about the U.S. economy poured money into commodities like oil and gold. Gas is up 32% since the start of the year, putting it near its highest level since hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico nearly three years ago. 
Gas meets about a fifth of the nation's electricity needs, heats about half of its homes and is an important ingredient for making plastics and fertilizer. The fuel is increasingly in demand because it burns more cleanly than coal. 
Analysts cite a variety of factors for gas's run-up in addition to the general rise in commodities. They include a colder-than-expected winter; falling production in Canada; and rising demand for oil, which has been propelled by investors seeking a safe haven. 
"I don't think we would have hit $10 [per million BTUs] if crude oil wasn't up at $100 [a barrel]," says Guy Gleichmann, president of United Strategic Investors Group in Hollywood, Fla., which doesn't have an investment in gas. 
The rise comes at a time when oil-and-gas companies, citing long- term trends, are redoubling efforts to find new gas supplies. Driving the trend: concerns over pollution and climate change. The U.S. Natural Gas Council, an industry group, predicts a carbon-capping system such as one now being considered by Congress could lead to a 20% increase in natural gas consumption over the next decade. 
"We clearly see that people are rejecting coal plants in every state we can think of, so we've got to come up with alternatives that work for the American consumer," says James Hackett, chairman and chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., one of the nation's largest producers of natural gas. "The power market will increasingly turn to natural gas as its one alternative." 
Those efforts are adding new gas supplies to the market after a decade of flat or falling production. Production last year rose 4.3% according to one government measure, marking the largest rise in more than 20 years. Most expect production to continue to rise this year. 
Over the short term, that could lead to new supplies that drive down prices later this year. Summer pricing predictions vary widely, but most analysts say natural-gas storage figures released last week would support summer prices around $7 to $8 per million BTUs. 
"At some point these high production rates are going to push prices down," Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Wolff says. 
J. Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James in Houston, predicts prices could drop to $5 per million BTUs or lower over the summer, especially if warm weather reduces demand in coming weeks. 
Many wells being drilled today require gas prices above $7 per million BTUs to be viable, and exploration in emerging areas such as the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania could be even more expensive. 
Some market watchers expect prices to remain high in coming months. Natural gas producers may have trouble keeping up last year's growth rate, they say. Offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico shot up 7% in December from the previous year, but that growth was almost entirely due to Independence Hub, a massive new offshore drilling project that went online late last year. With no similar projects anticipated in the immediate future, most analysts expect offshore growth to level off this year or next. 
Meanwhile, onshore production growth has relied heavily on the increased production in Texas and Wyoming, which together accounted for 78% of onshore growth last year.

Last week, when oil was hovering around $110 a barrel and American motorists were bracing for $4 a gallon gasoline come summer, Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr offered a timely reminder of how poor our forward vision is when it comes to energy and technology. 
Forecasting future energy prices and demand is "like sitting around in 1994 and forecasting (demand for) Web browsers," Mr. Doerr said at the Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference last week. Mr. Doerr would know. He and his company, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, had a front row seat (and did very, very well) during the Internet revolution created by the Netscape browser. 
In other words, no one knows whether Mr. Doerr and others in Silicon Valley's "clean tech" movement will succeed in their effort to do for the way we fuel cars what Netscape or Google did for the way we shop and collect information. Silicon Valley's clean technology capitalists are bubbling with big ideas for reordering the $6 trillion global energy market. Mr. Doerr says the mission to cut the amount of fossil fuel burned by the American way of life is more important to him than "some Web two-dot-0 site that helps your college kid get laid." 
But Mr. Doerr cautions that "changing consumer behavior is the key. . . . We've only taken this issue to the head of Main Street. We haven't walked down Main Street." 
I would add, we haven't driven, either. 
Within the next year or two, Americans are going to be pushed as never before to live without burning so much oil, particularly in their cars. This is partly because all three presidential candidates support proposals to raise the price of emitting carbon -- a geeky way of saying burning gasoline to drive or using coal to power the house. 
It's wrong to say that the climate change argument is over -- there is a large cadre of serious people (See GM's Bob Lutz) who don't accept that man-made CO2 is a real problem. But from a political perspective, it appears that doing nothing is no longer an option in the face of skyrocketing oil prices, energy security concerns and environmental worries. 
We don't have to wait for the presidential election to feel the effect of the new reality. OPEC and the world commodity markets are already exacting a "carbon tax" of their own, payable at your local service station. 
Lots of people have grand visions for freeing transportation from oil. There's even a big "X-Prize" being offered to someone who can design a successful 100 mile per gallon car. 
The problem -- made clear during presentations by an impressive cadre of business leaders, technology visionaries and politicians at this conference in Santa Barbara, Calif., -­is one word: inertia. 
Consider the inertia facing the car business. Daimler AG Chairman Dieter Zetsche and General Motors Corp. Vice Chairman for product development Bob Lutz both have impressive green technology stories to tell. 
Mr. Zetsche has an S-Class diesel with a "mild hybrid" electric boost ready to roll that he expects will average 44 miles per gallon. Mr. Lutz has mobilized teams at GM to transform the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid from a show car with a press release that said it could run as many as 40 miles on electricity alone to a real car that can run for 40 miles on electricity alone. 
Fabulous, except for this: These vehicles could turn out to be very limited volume and relatively expensive exercises. Mr. Lutz, in particular, expressed little confidence that ordinary Americans who buy the bulk of GM's cars are prepared to pay big premiums for low- carbon cars. "Unless consumers are feeling pain in the wallet, it's not going to work," Mr. Lutz said. 
In other words, people aren't likely to embrace expensive, new and unfamiliar automotive technology without a big economic push. 
"The least efficient way to reduce carbon dioxide is doing it through the vehicle," Mr. Zetsche says. Reducing how much people drive, and cutting the energy consumed in houses, is a better way to cut the amount of carbon we consume. 
Could ethanol ride to the rescue to fuel the cars we know and like today without the guilt and cost of feeding more cash to the global oil business? Not soon. Silicon Valley ethanol evangelist Vinod Khosla says it will be 10 years before ethanol distilled from waste products (not food grains) will affect the price of oil. But he complains that he needs "the oil industry to come along" and put in more pumps to dispense 85% ethanol. In other words, he is straining to overcome the inertia of the service station industry's status quo. Needless to say, the oil industry isn't racing to hand its revenue stream to Mr. Khosla's ethanol startups. 
Top advisors to the three main presidential candidates wrapped a similar message in a quite civil and substantive debate over energy policy. Putting the U.S. economy on a course to produce less carbon -- via a government system of carbon "caps" -- "is going to require a kind of social commitment the likes of which we haven't seen since World War II," said Jason Grumet, an advisor to Sen. Barack Obama. All of today's candidates are committed to some form of carbon cap. But all recall how far Jimmy Carter got when he tried to convince Americans to accept a lower-energy lifestyle back in the 1970s. 
Still, with sufficient force, stationary objects do move. As gasoline prices have risen, compact cars have started to grow as a share of total vehicles purchased by American consumers from 23.8% in 2000 to 33.9% so far this year, according to Power Information Network data. Since Jan. 2007, the share of four-cylinder engines has risen to 40% of new vehicles from 33.6%, while the share of eight- and six- cylinder engines has declined. That's not a revolution, but it's not more of the same. 
Inertia is a powerful force. If car makers and politicians sound reluctant to take it on, it's for good reason. Mr. Doerr and his Silicon Valley compatriots have found that with the right levers and sufficient persistence, big rocks can be made to roll down hill. Just don't expect it to happen in time to stop you from cursing the gas pump on your way to the beach on Memorial Day.

Abstract 
Jim Carlton GE Calls Energy Policy 'A Certain Kind of Hell' Jeffrey Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric Co., has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of government caps on carbon emissions. Lack of planning for new nuclear plants has paralyzed the industry; lack of progress on renewable-energy tax credits has clean- energy developers treading water.

Despite Marketing, Wal-Mart Declares: 'We Are Not Green' Mr. Scott was being candid when a questioner asked him to explain why Wal-Mart's carbon emissions were continuing to grow despite its much-publicized efforts to reduce its 
carbon footprint. He said Wal- Mart is trying, but it also needs to grow at the same time. Asked when he expected the company to meet his goal of having zero waste and 100% 
renewable energy over time, Mr. Scott said, "I haven't a clue." 
He did say the company is working with its thousands of suppliers to reduce the amount of cardboard and other plastic packaging in its products. The company is also looking 
into ways to reduce the amount of plastic used in making bottled-water containers, he said. The impetus for the company in doing all this isn't just to please environmentalists, 
he said, but to save money. 

"It really is about how you take cost out, which is waste," he said. 

The savings by taking out wasted material helps keep prices low for Wal-Mart's customers. Indeed, Mr. Scott told reporters after his talk that the current economic slump is 
prodding Wal-Mart even more to undertake its waste-reduction program. "When is a better time?"

GE Calls Energy Policy 
'A Certain Kind of Hell' 
Jeffrey Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric Co., has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of government caps on carbon emissions. In 

transforming one of the world's biggest companies into a clean-tech juggernaut, he smells the chance to make a lot of money -- if the U.S. doesn't miss the train altogether. 

"It's no great thrill for me to do this stuff. I'm not an environmentalist. But if business has no voice, that's the worst of all worlds," Mr. Immelt said at a keynote speech at the 
ECO:nomics conference. 
What's scarier than seemingly inevitable government-mandated climate-change legislation that targets most of the industries GE thrives in? Exactly what the U.S. has now. 
"We live today in a certain kind of hell, where nothing happens," he said. Lack of planning for new nuclear plants has paralyzed the industry; lack of progress on renewable-

energy tax credits has clean- energy developers treading water. Worries over how carbon will be priced has the traditional coal-powered utility industry trembling. All are GE 

strongholds. 
Mr. Immelt was an early advocate of government action to fight climate change through the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a business group. It is, he admits, self-serving to a 
certain degree. 

Predictability makes investment planning easier, he said. Clean technology is a huge business for GE already, and stands to grow, if not in the U.S. then overseas. Renewable 
energy isn't just a subsidy baby, subject to the whims of Congress. "If the U.S. doesn't buy my wind turbines, I'll go to Turkey," he said. 
He added that government largess helps drive progress. That admission riled free-market types in the room who accused him of betraying his capitalist credentials. 

"Don't worship false idols," he countered. "The government has its hand in every industry. If we have to have them, I'd prefer they were productive rather than destructive." 
Mr. Immelt's crusade for a new American energy policy -- one heavy on the kinds of technologies GE sells -- isn't much different from that of any business with friends on K 
Street. 

"I'd just as soon have a seat at the table than have it pushed down my throat," he said. 
-- Keith Johnson 
Just How Much Green 

Should Boards Want? 
Are big-company CEOs that change their businesses to deal with climate change trailblazers, or are they gullible dopes hijacked by green activists? 
Steve Milloy, head of the $11 million Free Enterprise Action Fund, spends his time as a self-described "headache" to corporate chieftains like GE's Mr. Immelt. His fund regularly sues companies for shirking what he calls their duty to shareholders to get greener, even if it costs money. His nemesis, Mindy Lubber, runs a $5 trillion coalition of investors pushing companies to come clean on what climate change means for them, and how they plan to deal with it. 
On a stage together for the first time at ECO:nomics, the two shareholder gadflies painted radically different pictures of what shareholders should care about today. 
Making big cuts in emissions won't be easy, or free. But prodding the market to put a price on carbon -- and prodding companies to lead the way -- will limit emissions and drive technological revolution, Ms. Lubber said. 
Hogwash, said Mr. Milloy. Social activists have taken their pitchforks to the corporate gates. And companies are falling for it, he says. CEOs who paint a rosy picture of their sudden greening "are just blowing smoke up everybody's dress," he said.

Abstract 
Last year, the total value of carbon permits changing hands -- whether on public exchanges or in private, off-market transactions, where most still occur -- nearly doubled to 40 billion euros, or about $60 billion, according to Oslo-based Point Carbon, a market research firm. It gives these companies -- mainly industrial giants like power generators, steel mills and cement makers -- a clear idea of the market price of carbon both currently and well off into the future. 

Full text 
LONDON -- The planet is getting warmer. Richard Sandor, a 66-year- old economist, is getting wealthier. 
His company, London-based Climate Exchange PLC, has carved out a key role in Europe's booming trade in "carbon permits" -- essentially, buying and selling the right to pollute. Since 2005, the European Union has required major polluters to either cut the amount of carbon dioxide they spew, or buy pollution credits in the open market. 
A big chunk of the action occurs on an exchange founded by Mr. Sandor, a one-time Berkeley professor who has morphed into a gregarious climate-change entrepreneur. 
He's among the most successful investors trying to profit from rising environmental awareness, whether by speculating in energy commodities or launching wind-power companies. Last year, the total value of carbon permits changing hands -- whether on public exchanges or in private, off-market transactions, where most still occur -- nearly doubled to 40 billion euros, or about $60 billion, according to Oslo-based Point Carbon, a market research firm. 
Yesterday, Climate Exchange's stock jumped 16% after the firm reported a tripling in 2007 revenue to GBP 13.6 million, or about $27 million. That gives the company, which handles about 90% of the trading on carbon exchanges, a market capitalization of roughly $1.31 billion. Mr. Sandor's 20% stake is worth more than $260 million on paper. 
It's an unusual mix of markets theory and environmentalism. "The right wing always suspects you of being a tree-hugging environmentalist and the left wing accuses you of being a money- grubbing capitalist," says Mr. Sandor, who back in the 1990s developed a markets-based system to cut down on pollutants causing acid rain. 
Carbon trading is drawing intense interest from rivals. In January, NYSE Euronext launched its own carbon exchange, bringing the total number to at least eight globally. Citing "huge growth potential," the New York Mercantile Exchange plans to enter the field in this year's first quarter. 
The next big battlefield will be in the U.S., where Congress is currently debating setting up a system for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. Lawmakers are considering a system like the one created by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a global United Nations-sponsored accord that set emissions-cutting targets for the 175 nations that ratified it. Europe's program was an early test run of the Kyoto Protocol, whose emission restrictions began hitting industry this year. 
The U.S. hasn't ratified Kyoto. But all three leading Democratic and Republican presidential candidates say they want the U.S. to do more to fight climate change, and would likely set up a carbon-trading program. 
Carbon permits are traded much like physical commodities -- gold, oil or pork bellies. Each government-issued permit grants its holder permission to emit a ton of carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon Exchange makes money by taking a commission on each trade and by charging membership fees. 
So-called "cap and trade" programs like Europe's are intended to give polluters a financial incentive to clean up their act. Governments set emissions caps, and companies that beat them can trade their pollution credits to other firms willing to pay to pollute. Over time, the caps are lowered, making it costlier to choose to keep polluting. 
About 70% of carbon permits still change hands off the market, in private transactions between companies or financial institutions. Trading on an exchange is often more efficient than trying to find a buyer or seller alone. But for bigger trades, many companies and banks still prefer to do private deals so they don't tip off competitors or cause drastic swings in the still-nascent market. 
Still, Mr. Sandor's exchange is a key piece of the financial infrastructure underpinning this system. It gives these companies -- mainly industrial giants like power generators, steel mills and cement makers -- a clear idea of the market price of carbon both currently and well off into the future. It also lets hedge funds and other investors speculate in the permits just as they would in other assets, such as gold or stock. 
Some economists argue for taxing polluters instead, including Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw. A carbon tax, they say, would be more transparent and less vulnerable to lobbying by industries trying to win higher caps for themselves. 
Last month, a report by the Congressional Budget Office said a carbon tax could achieve the same emissions reductions "at a fraction of the cost" of a cap-and-trade system. The savings stem partly from the fact that such a policy is simpler to implement than building a carbon market. 
Other criticisms of carbon trading focus on the financial wizards -- such as Mr. Sandor -- who design and run the markets. "Financial resources are being redistributed to the banks and traders rather than paying for technological innovations to cut emissions," says Carlo Stagnaro of the Italy-based economic think tank Istituto Bruno Leoni, who just published a paper on the European Union's emissions-trading system. 
Europe's own system shows evidence of these strains. Governments there initially yielded to industry pressure and allocated too many carbon permits, giving companies little 

immediate incentive to cut their emissions. 
The system, which has been up and running only three years in Europe, hasn't yet produced big reductions in emissions. But carbon trading has boomed -- handing a tidy profit 
to banks, traders and exchanges such as the one founded by Mr. Sandor. Power companies and heavy industry trade carbon continuously to try to make money off price 
fluctuations and to hedge their future risk, as well as to comply with Kyoto rules. 

Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, agrees Europe's carbon market isn't perfect, but defends the role of financiers. 

"The only way we can fight climate change is if there is an opportunity for businesses and individuals to make a fortune off of it," he said. 
That's what Mr. Sandor has done. "I am a capitalist who runs a business and has to deliver value to shareholders," he said during a recent interview at the Ritz Hotel in London. 
"I consider myself to be an environmentalist, but I divorce those sentiments from my day job." 

Mr. Sandor, a dapper professor in close-cropped hair and tailored suits, started his career teaching economics and finance at the University of California, Berkeley, where he 

developed ideas for trading intangible things, like interest rates or mortgages, on a market. 
He later made a name for himself at the Chicago Board of Trade where he did leading work on developing financial futures markets in the U.S. Today he lives in Chicago with his 
wife, a painter, in a home where the walls are covered with his extensive collection of 20th- century photography. 

He first envisioned a carbon market long before many people had heard of global warming. In 1992 at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, he presented an 

academic paper on how markets might be used to reduce carbon emissions. 
Of the conference, Mr. Sandor recalls: "There was more tie-dye there than at a Grateful Dead concert. It felt like a movement." Indeed, the event laid the groundwork for what 
eventually became the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. 

It was in Brazil, eating shrimp and sipping a caipirinha on the beach, that Mr. Sandor says he first thought about setting up his own carbon market. "I know how to pioneer new 
markets," he recalls thinking. "I've done it before." 

In the late 1990s he finally got his chance -- or so he thought. At that time, countries around the world started signing on to the Kyoto Protocol. 
He assumed the U.S. would sign on, too, so he founded the Chicago Climate Exchange in anticipation of a U.S. carbon-trading boom. However, soon after taking office, the Bush 
administration declined to ratify Kyoto, arguing it would hurt U.S. companies' competitiveness because developing countries like China and India weren't required to curb 
emissions. 

Mr. Sandor's dream fizzled. With no treaty, U.S. companies wouldn't be required to cut carbon emissions. He was left with a company that basically had little reason to exist. 
But rather than dumping it, he decided to convert the Chicago Climate Exchange into a system that companies could join to voluntarily reduce their emissions. 
By 2003, he teamed up with a friend in London, insurance executive Neil Eckert, to take everything learned in the U.S. experiment and apply it in Europe, which was then just 

gearing up its own trading system. So they set up a separate carbon-trading market in London, the European Climate Exchange. Mr. Eckert later became its chief executive, a 

position he holds today. 
Mr. Sandor had an ace up his sleeve: He sat on the board of IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, which operates Europe's leading energy exchange, trading oil, gas and electricity. 
ICE agreed to host Mr. Sandor's new European Climate Exchange on its system as part of an undisclosed revenue-sharing agreement. 

That deal was an important part of Climate Exchange's success at beating rival markets: The ICE affiliation instantly put his exchange in front of Europe's commodity traders. Trading began at the start of 2005. It wasn't smooth sailing. On May 12, 2006, EU regulators shocked the market by posting data showing that national governments had 
allocated far too many permits. For example, Sweden's actual emissions were around 10% below the number of emissions allowances the government handed out. The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and France confronted a similar situation. Abyd Karmali, head of Merrill Lynch's carbon-trading business, was in Cologne, Germany, that day attending a carbon-market conference. People were huddled around 
computers, watching prices fall like a rock. 
"It was surreal," said Mr. Karmali. "People were frantically calling their trading desks." 
In three short days, the price of carbon collapsed 60%. Mr. Karmali called those events "a litmus test" for Mr. Sandor's exchange. "It showed us that the infrastructure worked 

and that the market could withstand future shocks." 
Learning from their mistake, European regulators later tightened the emissions caps. 
Europe's carbon market continued to grow, and with it, Mr. Sandor's company. In trading yesterday on London's AIM, the 16% jump in its share price, to 1,441 pence ($28.89), 

followed the company's report that volumes grew on both the London and Chicago exchanges. But profitability is still elusive: The firm posted a net loss of GBP 4.1 million last 

year, although that was an improvement over the year- earlier loss of GBP 10.5 million. 
Despite its role in Europe's fast-growing carbon market, Mr. Sandor's firm is still a minnow in the shark-infested waters of commodities trading. It's run from a small office in the 
financial district of London where a dozen or so employees work in a single big room lined with tattered carpet. 

There's no traditional trading floor -- the actual trading is done entirely online. Commodities traders at banks world-wide have the exchange's software on their screens and can 

buy and sell carbon permits at the click of a mouse button. 
Companies that must comply with Kyoto rules can also buy and sell on the exchange. For instance, say, a German utility with excess credits would be free to sell them to a 
Japanese steelmaker firm that wanted them. Trades are cleared by the exchange, which acts as a kind of guarantor as well, cutting down on credit risk for the buyer and seller. 

A 2008 permit entitling the bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide is currently trading just under 22 euros, up from 17 euros or so a year earlier. 

At the end of each year, regulated companies must hold permits representing their total emissions over that period. A fairly typical coal-fired power plant might emit anywhere 
from five million to 15 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, depending on its size and other variables. 
The risk for Mr. Sandor is that his firm will get beaten by much bigger rivals when the U.S. sets up its own system for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Analysts estimate that 

the U.S. carbon market would be about three times the size of Europe's, a windfall that is sure to attract rivals. 
"We're going to keep succeeding," Mr. Sandor says. Among other things, he and Mr. Eckert are trying to stay one step ahead by trying to gain footing in other new markets. 

Last December they signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Petroleum Corp. to explore setting up an emissions-trading platform in Beijing. And in India the firm is exploring establishing a voluntary market like the one originally set up in Chicago a decade ago. 
"We view ambiguity as an opportunity, not as a deterrent," Mr. Sandor says.

Abstract 
For decades, critics dismissed desalination as a costly boondoggle that burns colossal amounts of energy, including dirty fuels like coal. 

Full text 
PERTH, Australia -- As global water shortages loom, this remote city on Australia's parched western coast is giving desalination -- the arduous process of removing salt from sea water -- new clout. 
Opened in late 2006, Perth's $360 million desalination plant sucks in roughly 50,000 gallons of the Indian Ocean every minute. It then runs that water through special filters that separate out the salt, yielding some 25,000 gallons of drinkable water -- enough to meet nearly a fifth of Perth's current demand. 
For decades, critics dismissed desalination as a costly boondoggle that burns colossal amounts of energy, including dirty fuels like coal. Technologically complex, it's also far more expensive than tapping other water sources. The few major desalination plants that did make it to fruition went up mainly in the Middle East, which had energy -- and money -- to burn. 
Perth's facility squarely tackles both environmental and financial concerns. It gets around the issue of noxious emissions by harnessing power from a wind farm. By relying primarily on renewable energy -- a recent trend in desalination -- the plant releases fewer dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Upgraded systems remove salt more efficiently than past processes, making operating costs less daunting. 
Despite higher water bills for consumers, officials here deem the project so successful that they plan to build a second, $875 million desalination plant. Once online, it will allow Perth to source as much as a third of its water from the ocean and significantly cut its dependence on rain-fed reserves. 
Not long ago, "desalination was something you'd do only when you didn't have any other choice," says Jim Gill, chief executive of Water Corp., Perth's state-owned water supplier. Now, "there just aren't that many sources left." 
Perth's plunge into desalination comes at a critical time, when water is emerging as the world's next major natural-resources challenge. Water use, like oil, is surging as economic growth takes off in China, India and elsewhere. According to the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka, about a fifth of the world's population, or more than 1.2 billion people, already lives in areas with insufficient supply. 
Due to changing rainfall patterns linked to climate change, many places -- including parts of Australia, the American Southwest, India and Western Europe -- are getting as much as 10% less rain than they used to. There's also a global push to expand agriculture, the world's biggest guzzler of water, to meet growing food and alternative energy demand. 
As many as 75 major desalination projects are in various stages of development world-wide, including a $300 million facility north of San Diego. Although large-scale desalination is still unpopular in the U.S., local officials and private investors are pressing to build plants in other states such as Texas and Massachusetts. 
Several Australian cities are adding massive desalination plants. The largest, near Melbourne, carries a price tag of more than $2.5 billion. Similar facilities are envisioned in Spain and India. And London is planning a $400 million plant along the River Thames. 
Environmentalists worry that the combined impact of these plants will be devastating, especially if they run on power generated by cheap coal. Big desalination plants can burn through enough electricity annually to power more than 35,000 homes a year. 
Last June, WWF, the international conservation organization, released a major report challenging the desalination boom. It cited a potentially "major misdirection of public attention, policy and funds." 
Yet WWF staffers acknowledge there could be a place for some desalination plants -- so long as certain criteria are met. First, however, they want cities to exhaust other options, such as water recycling. If plants are eventually called for, the WFF wants to see them built like the one in Perth. 
"Perth is going to be the model for desalination in the developed world," says Tom Pankratz, an industry consultant in Houston. Although other facilities might not employ the same renewable sources for power, most of the newer ones are trying to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, says Mr. Pankratz, including the latest plants in London and Sydney. "Everyone is thinking that's going to be the way of the future." 
Surrounded by desert, this remote Western Australia city is booming as a center for mining iron ore and other valuable commodities. By some estimates, Perth is attracting as many as 750 families a week, and now has a population in excess of 1.3 million. 
But in recent years, water supplies have shrunk as rainfall levels declined -- possibly due to factors related to global warming. In the 1980s, annual inflows into reservoirs fell to less than 300 billion liters a year; by the late 1990s, the figure was down to fewer than 150 billion liters. 
Leading the charge for desalination was Mr. Gill, 61 years old, a self-taught expert on climate change. A native Australian, he received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard and worked for many years at Western Australia's railway system before joining the Water Corp., the state-owned company, in the mid-1990s. His hobbies include trekking deep into the Australian Outback to see aboriginal rock paintings in their original setting. 
He says he noticed the sharp drop-off in available water after studying historical charts at Water Corp. Then, in 2001, Perth had one of its worst droughts ever. Reservoirs were less than 25% full and officials worried the city would run out of water completely. 
Water Corp. executives ordered residents to restrict garden sprinkler use to two days a week. One scuttled idea involved towing, and melting down, an iceberg from Antarctica. 
Officials also mulled the case for desalination. Mr. Gill's engineers had studied it before as part of a long-term planning process, and had concluded the method was viable. But 
they didn't think it would be needed until 2020 at the earliest. 

At first analysis, the cost seemed "horrifying," Mr. Gill recalls. According to David Lloyd Owen, a water expert at United Kingdom-based consulting firm Envisager, even the 

cheapest desalinated water can cost eight times more than traditional groundwater sources, which can be tapped for as little as five cents per cubic meter. 
Mr. Gill changed his mind after desalination experts in Germany and elsewhere acquainted him with the latest technological improvements. He also saw that other water sources 
were becoming more expensive to exploit -- making desalination look more attractive. 

Most modern facilities use a process known as reverse osmosis. This involves pushing water under high pressure through porous membranes that filter out the salt. Energy is 

needed to raise the pressure and then force the water through the membranes. 
In recent years, engineers have developed better membranes that capture salt more effectively than before, and they've improved "pre- treatment" methods to remove large 
particles from water before it goes through the process. Newer facilities also use "energy recovery devices" that allow them to recycle as much as 90% of the energy that's 
expended. 

By 2003, Mr. Gill was working to convert a dubious public. Homeowners fretted over potentially higher water bills, which stood to rise by as much as 12%. Environmentalists 

warned that saline discharge would turn a nearby bay into a giant salt lake. 
Perth's newspapers blasted the project in editorials and cartoons. Critics insisted the idea didn't address Perth's long-term water problems, which they say require more efforts 
to promote conservation. 

Desalination "is exactly like taking an aspirin for a tumor," says Jorg Imberger, director of the Centre for Water Research at the University of Western Australia in Perth. He 
believes people are simply using too much water. While the Perth plant was under consideration, he says, he phoned the state premier directly to voice his complaints. 
Mr. Gill, meanwhile, responded to naysayers by warning that Water Corp. might impose a total sprinkler ban if water supplies didn't improve. 

To counter environmental opposition, his team considered planting thousands of trees to offset greenhouse gas emissions. 
But the real breakthrough came with a plan to use renewable power from a $165 million wind farm. The project's developers, which include private investors and a government-
owned power company, had wanted to build the facility for years, but needed a big customer. 

Making sure the desalination plant didn't burn fossil fuels was necessary to "defuse one of the key arguments against" it, Mr. Gill says. The eco-friendly design "also suited our 

values." 
Mr. Gill cultivated unusual allies, including members of Perth's gardening industry. He also circulated charts and diagrams to the public showing the huge drop in water supply -­an effort that won over Geoff Gallop, then the state premier. Government officials approved the plant in late 2004. 

"I wanted to make sure we had water security," says Mr. Gallop, now a professor at the University of Sydney. 
The plant was up and running by late 2006. Situated in a bland industrial park 45 minutes south of the city, it includes a first- stage facility that removes silt and other 

impurities from water that's piped in from the adjacent, azure-blue sea. The water is then moved into a giant building the length of a football field where it is pressurized and 
sent through membranes in high-tech vessels. 
The resulting water is treated with chlorine to meet health standards and piped into a reservoir that feeds into the local water supply. Leftover salt is flushed back into the 

ocean, where it disperses. 

The facility even includes a tap where visitors can take a quick slurp. "Tastes better with whiskey," says project manager John Stansfield. When the process is finished, the water 
has a salt-free taste. 
Some Perth residents still question the facility's value. Advocates for the poor say that lower-income citizens, including many Aboriginals, can't afford to pay more for water. 
"Why are we building desalination plants to help wealthy people have gardens?" asks Irina Cattalini, director of social policy at the Western Australian Council of Social Service, 

an advocacy group. 
Other desalination foes worry that Perth's success may be inspiring other cities to follow suit, but with lesser regard for any environmental toll. 
At the Garden Affair, a small garden center in one of Perth's wealthier neighborhoods, some patrons indicated they have no intention of cutting back their water use -- even if 

the additional supply comes at a higher price. 
"In the long run, we have to have the water, don't we?" said Lorraine Cook, a 65-year-old retiree who was shopping there one recent afternoon. 
"I'd rather have a garden that uses more water" than have to give up azaleas, roses and other such plants, said Joanna Gage, a 45-year-old compliance manager at a financial-

services company. 

Even some of the country's biggest critics of desalination have warmed up to the Perth facility -- including, to a degree, Mr. Imberger of the University of Western Australia. 
Desalination "gives you security," he acknowledges. And he's pleased about the use of renewable energy. 
Mr. Gill and others agree that desalination isn't perfect. "The price of water will probably go up over time, but it's scarce -- I think people realize that," says Mr. Gallop, the 

former state premier. "We're in a new world now."

The Wall Street Journal Online 
The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here. 
The themes are familiar: record oil prices, mounting evidence of environmental damage from carbon-based fuels, a solidifying global consensus on the dangers of climate change and knowledge that the next U.S. president, Republican or Democrat, will likely transform policy. But combined, they are producing a greater sense of policy urgency and political intrigue. 
Let's start with the polar bears. The inspector general of the U.S. Interior Department has opened an "initial inquiry" into why the Fish and Wildlife Service didn't meet its January deadline for ruling on whether to list the animal as a threatened species, and then failed to do so again despite taking the extra month it claimed to need for the complexities involved. A decision on the polar bears, as The Wall Street Journal points out, is feared by oil and gas companies that worry it could trigger new drilling restrictions in Alaska. Scientists believe the bear to be threatened because global warming has increasingly melted away its sea-ice habitat. 
A batch of new studies in scientific journals suggests that reducing the greenhouse-gas emissions that trap heat in the earth's atmosphere and cause global warming poses an even tougher problem than has been thought. The findings of scientists in the U.S., Canada and Germany suggest "both industrialized and developing nations must wean themselves off fossil fuels by as early as mid-century in order to prevent warming that could change precipitation patterns and dry up sources of water world-wide," the Washington Post reports. For now, that goal of zero emissions in the coming decades seems impossible. Many nations have been promising to lower their emission for about a decade, but they don't include the U.S., China or India, where economic activity and growth consume the world's biggest amounts of oil, gas and coal in ways that let carbon fuse with oxygen in the air to produce the carbon dioxide that helps keep in the heat. The Post tallies human carbon output at 10 billion tons a year and steadily rising. 
As it is, the U.S. Senate is working on legislation aimed at cutting U.S. emissions by 70% before 2050, compared with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's aim to cut 80% and John McCain's to cut 60%, the Post notes. But even turning those ambitions into reality will require drastic political, consumer and corporate action. Awareness that U.S. emission policy will change next January could be behind Canada's current push for Washington to define a 2007 American energy law and how it will affect petroleum drawn from Alberta's oil sands, the Financial Times says. In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates that copies in Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson warns that Ottawa fears "expansive interpretation" of the Energy Independence and Security Act that could check U.S. buying of Alberta oil. The law "limits U.S. government procurement of alternative fuels to those from which the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are equal to or less than those from conventional fuel from conventional petroleum sources," the FT notes. Oil-sands production emits more CO2 than conventional sources. 
The Bush administration nevertheless has been encouraging the oil- sands projects to the north, at a time when a tight global supply-and- demand equation is helping to keep petroleum prices high. And the relentless demand for oil and global-warming implications of the oil- sands issue are also at play in looming security concerns about the increasingly accessible Arctic. The European Union's two top foreign- policy officials, Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, plan to tell the bloc's 27 heads of state at this week's summit that global warming is "likely to trigger a dangerous contest between Russia and the West for the vast mineral riches" in the region, the Guardian reports. Echoing earlier warnings from the United Nations, the two predict that global warming will generate energy wars, mass migration, failed states and political radicalization. And they see probable conflicts in Arctic waterways as a result of "intensified competition over access to, and control over, energy resources." 
Where the NSA Is Also Watching 
Even as Congress debates whether and how to expand the National Security Agency's authority to eavesdrop on at least partially domestic telephone conversations, the NSA has been building up a system that vacuums up and analyses "domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers, credit-card transactions, travel and telephone records," The Wall Street Journal reports. The NSA program is similar to an experimental Pentagon system killed by Congress five years ago out of concerns it posed too broad an intrusion into Americans' private lives, the Journal notes. Now, current and former intelligence officials tell the Journal, the electronic-intelligence agency is receiving huge volumes of "so-called 'transactional' data from other agencies or private companies, and its sophisticated software programs analyze the various transactions for suspicious patterns." 
It does so to search for patterns of activity that could alert the government to the presence of foreign terrorists. But the NSA program is using "a cluster of powerful intelligence-gathering programs, all of which sparked civil-liberties complaints when they came to light," as well as "an ad-hoc collection of so-called 'black programs' whose existence is undisclosed," the Journal says. The Journal reports that "a number of NSA employees have expressed concerns that the agency may be overstepping its authority by veering into domestic surveillance." While NSA officials say the program only focuses on foreign threats, they say "it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between domestic and international communications in a digital era, so they need to sweep up more information." 
Also of Note. . . 
Associated Press: A vast array of pharmaceuticals -- including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones -- have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an investigation shows. While the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny, measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion -- far below the levels of a medical dose -- and utilities insist their water is safe, the presence of so many prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long-term consequences to human health. 
USA Today: Federal Aviation Administration officials overseeing Southwest Airlines ignored safety violations, leaked sensitive data to the carrier and tried to intimidate two inspectors to head off investigations, according to previously undisclosed allegations by the inspectors. 
Wall Street Journal: Spain's Socialist leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, beat his conservative rivals in national elections yesterday, heading into a second term with a clear mandate: engineering a soft landing for a country that has fueled European economic growth for a decade. Both parties had pledged to cushion the blow of Spain's impending economic downturn, but voters bought the Socialist recipe of increased public spending, a raise in the minimum wage and tax cuts aimed in particular at low-income families and young people. 
Washington Post: The heads of Pakistan's two leading political parties vowed to form a coalition government and restore the country's embattled judiciary by returning to the bench within a month judges who were deposed last year by President Pervez Musharraf. 
New York Times: The government of Israel said it has approved the construction of hundreds of homes in a West Bank settlement north of Jerusalem, a move that could further complicate a peace effort already hobbled by violence. The announcement slightly eased pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert from the right wing in his government, particularly after a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem fatally shot eight students, most of them teenagers, at a prestigious Jewish seminary in western Jerusalem. 
Legal Times: The House is planning to file a lawsuit early this week challenging the Bush administration's assertion of executive privilege to shield current and former White House officials from congressional subpoenas. The lawsuit represents an untested strategy in the historical back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch over the government's fundamental separation of powers. 
Bloomberg: China's trade surplus dropped for the first time in almost a year and export growth plunged as the worst blizzards in half a century disrupted shipments and U.S. demand weakened. Exports rose 6.5%, the slowest pace in almost six years, aiding government efforts to cool the world's fourth-biggest economy. China's surpluses cause tension with trading partners and threaten to worsen 11-year high inflation by flooding the financial system with cash. 
Times of London: Five of the seven officials at the British Financial Services Authority who were directly responsible for the flawed supervision of troubled lender Northern Rock ­
- which required a massive government bailout -- have quit. The FSA, the body responsible for ensuring that U.K. banks have strong-enough balance sheets and sufficient liquidity, has come under fire for failing to spot the fatal flaw in Northern Rock's business model -- and it is expected to admit to shortcomings in its supervision of the Rock in a report this month. 
Women's Wear Daily: Bloomingdale's appears ready to take its expansion overseas and join the rush of high-end retail and designer brands headed to the Middle East, and real-estate sources say the retailer's first stop could be the epic Dubai Mall, which is under construction for a late 2008 or 2009 opening, and is planned to be the largest in the world. A source in the Middle East said Bloomingdale's is also eyeing Kuwait. 
Quote of the Day 
"Debt is taking a more-pronounced role in culture as it transforms from a manageable burden into an increasingly inescapable shackle," Carey Greenberg-Berger, weekend editor for the Consumerist, tells Ad Age, which reports that credit-card issuing companies have become public villains akin to junk-food purveyors blamed for epidemic obesity.

Abstract 
Over the next few decades, billions of dollars will be spent on environmentally friendly products designed to improve energy efficiency, clean up water systems and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. 

Full Text 
Although experts differ over the pace of global warming, few doubt its existence anymore. Over the next few decades, billions of dollars will be spent on environmentally friendly products designed to improve energy efficiency, clean up water systems and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Who's leading the charge? Corporate America. Companies know there's money to be made combating the effects of global warming. 
For an investor, there are plenty of these green-wave companies to choose from. Here are five that get a large percentage of their business from environmentally friendly products and should help not only the planet but also their investors. 
Philips (PHG, about $39) 
The Netherlands-based Philips makes compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs, which use far less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs. As prices of these bulbs have come down over the past five years, sales have jumped. Kaj den Daas, chairman of Philips Lighting North America, says more growth is on the way, since CFLs still account for less than 10% of the 12 billion bulbs sold world-wide. Philips trades at a reasonable 13 times next year's expected earnings. 
American Superconductor 
(AMSC, $23) 
Utility companies have long used copper wire to conduct electricity, but American Superconductor's newer high-temperature superconductor wire can carry 150 times the electricity of copper wire. That means utilities can lay down fewer wires, provide more electricity and cut maintenance costs. American Superconductor hasn't turned a profit in its 21 years, but many analysts expect it to get close by the end of its March 2009 fiscal year, because of new wire production methods and its fast-growing wind-turbine­products business. 
Veolia Environnement (VE, $89) 
Since less than 1% of the world's water is fit to drink, it's important that water infrastructure systems don't leak. Enter French company Veolia, the world's largest provider of water services, which helps municipalities fix their crumbling water systems. Veolia takes over the water system, makes improvements and passes the costs to customers. With a price 20 times next year's estimated profit, the stock is not inexpensive for a utility, but few utilities have such high profit growth potential. 
Zoltek (ZOLT, $23) 
Government mandates requiring alternative-energy use are being passed everywhere from France to China. That's good news for St. Louis-based Zoltek, the largest producer of the industrial-grade carbon fiber used to make windmill blades. The Global Wind Energy Council and Greenpeace expect wind energy to grow 28% a year through 2010. ThinkEquity Partners analyst Michael Lew thinks the stock can go to $53 in the next 12 months. 
SunPower (SPWR, $65) 
Solar power has been around for decades but only recently has become a viable alternative-energy source. Production costs have fallen to 25 cents a kilowatt hour from more than 50 cents, putting it closer to coal's less than 10 cents. San Jose, Calif.-based SunPower makes cells that are the most efficient at converting the sun's rays into electricity, and its shares have nearly doubled in less than a year. It trades at a hefty 32 times estimated 2008 earnings, but if the company increases 2008 profits by 66%, as analysts expect, then it's not so pricey.

Abstract 
Airlines are under mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, even though aviation's pollutants amount to less than 3% of all emissions. The U.S. Air Force and others, including Airbus, have been conducting extensive research into alternative fuels made from resources like natural gas and coal.

Ever a showman, Virgin Atlantic Airlines President Richard Branson opened a vial of jet fuel made with oil from coconuts and Brazilian babassu nuts and drank it, forcing a stiff smile. 
"It's more appropriate for the engine," he said before TV cameras. Later, he said privately that he had been told he could drink it, "but my god, it was horrible." 
Sir Richard hopes that he and airline passengers will have a much better taste for "biofuel" in a few years. 
On Sunday, Virgin flew a Boeing 747 from London's Heathrow Airport to Amsterdam with one of the four engines burning a mixture of 80% jet fuel and 20% oil from naturally grown plants. The first commercial airline test of biofuel came off without a hitch -- save Sir Richard's burping -- demonstrating that someday planes may not fly on petroleum alone. 
Virgin, and the handful of other companies involved in the project, are hopeful that in three to six years, passengers may be riding on jets at least partially powered by naturally grown oil. The project's participants believe this could lead to a 20% reduction in total emissions. 
Airlines are under mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming, even though aviation's pollutants amount to less than 3% of all emissions. Jets are visible signs of environmental damage, and scientists have concerns that pollutants dropped directly into high altitudes may be more dangerous than those released on the ground. 
Some governments around the world are already taxing air passengers to discourage the pollution they cause, and airlines will likely be included in emissions-trading systems being proposed and may soon be forced to pay for their exhaust. Environmentalists in Europe have begun to question whether ultra cheap tickets lead to frivolous travel and unnecessary pollution. 
As a result, airlines are now realizing that environmental issues, more than economic slowdowns or airspace congestion, may be the greatest threat to the future growth of air travel. 
The combination of environmental taxes and high oil prices could make biofuels not only viable but also cheaper than petroleum-based fuel. On Sunday, Mr. Branson called on the United Kingdom government to reduce taxes on passengers for airlines that reduce emissions, with savings passed directly to passengers. He also suggested that in the future, passengers may be able to select airlines not only on prices, schedules, amenities, frequent-flier miles and such, but also on how "green" the airline and its fuel are. 
"This will encourage airline competition," he said. "Some passengers may go out of their way to fly a green airline." 
Biofuel doesn't burn any cleaner in jet engines than kerosene, the basis for jet fuel today. Emissions are actually about the same, fuel experts say. But proponents say biofuel can reduce total environmental damage by 20% because it is less harmful to produce. Plants and trees producing the oils remove carbon from the atmosphere, for example, and don't come with all the drilling, refining and even shipping costs of crude oil. Recently the impact of biofuels like ethanol made from crops like corn have been been questioned because of the impact on food prices, damage to farmland and pollution created producing the crops. For aviation use, fuel makers are working toward nonagricultural bio materials. 
The Virgin test, done in conjunction with Boeing Co. and engine- maker General Electric Co., came after extensive tests on the biofuel mixture by GE. The fuel was produced by Imperium Renewables Inc. of Seattle. 
The biofuels being tested now can be used in jet engines without any modification, both Boeing and GE said. That's crucial to airline adoption since financially ailing airlines are unlikely to make major voluntary investments just to reduce emissions. 
The U.S. Air Force and others, including Airbus, have been conducting extensive research into alternative fuels made from resources like natural gas and coal. The Air Force set a goal to have its entire fleet certified for alternative fuels by 2011. Airbus conducted a test flight with a gas-to-liquids fuel on Feb. 1, calling it a precursor to biofuels. But Boeing, GE and Virgin decided to go straight to biofuels with their research. 
Imperium, a four-year-old Seattle manufacturer of biodiesel fuels, was founded by John Plaza, a former Northwest Airlines Corp. captain who turned entrepreneur. The company solved a problem many fuel experts thought might be insurmountable -- producing a biofuel for jets that wouldn't freeze in the incredibly cold temperatures at flight altitudes. 
Timothy Held, manager of GE's advanced combustion engineering division, said that just 18 months ago, biofuels were nowhere near the freezing characteristics needed for use in jets. But Imperium came up with a process that yields fuel that won't freeze at minus-47 degrees -- the toughest aviation standard. 
GE tested two Imperium mixtures -- one with 20% natural oils and 80% kerosene and another with 40% natural oil and 60% kerosene. "There was no negative impact on performance," Dr. Held said. 
The future for viable biofuels won't likely be coconuts and babassu nuts, however, since oil from those plants, which are both used in cosmetics, lip balms and shaving creams, can't be produced in sufficient quantity to power the world's airlines. 
Mr. Plaza says Imperium's technology can make biojet fuel out of just about any renewable crop, and the substance that may hold the most promise for air travel is algae -­pond scum. Sewage-treatment plants offer an ample source, and algae-produced fuel wouldn't use up food crops like corn, soybeans or even coconuts. 
A fuel that is made completely from renewable sources and has the same energy output as kerosene is possible within five years, Mr. Plaza said. But before any biofuel starts getting pumped into airplanes, manufacturing plants have to be built, fuels have to win regulatory approval and customers have to be interested. It will be a long process.

Best 1 Year Performer: First Solar 
Headquarters: Phoenix 
CEO: Michael J. Ahearn, since 2000 
Market Cap: $20.82 billion 
2007 Revenue: $504 million* 
2007 Net Income: $158.4 million* 
*Fiscal year ended Dec. 29. 
CALL IT A YEAR IN THE SUN. 
Enthusiasm about the prospects for big solar projects and an increase in orders lifted First Solar Inc. to a stunning 795.2% total return in 2007, making it the top one-year 

performer among 1,000 companies in this year's Shareholder Scoreboard. 
Founded in 1999, the company makes solar modules that create electricity through a thin-film method that uses cadmium telluride as the semiconductor material, instead of 

polysilicon, which has been in short supply since 2004. Starting with a sheet of glass, First Solar creates solar modules in a continuous process that yields finished product two hours later. The company went public in late 2006 at $20 a share and closed Friday at $211.74. The shares hit an intraday peak of $283 in late December. A $1,000 investment in First 
Solar at the end of 2006 would have been worth $8,952 just a year later, compared with $1,055 for a similar investment in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
First Solar's performance reflects bullish sentiment about renewable energy in general and solar technology in particular. Many solar- energy firms are limited only by how much product they can turn out. First Solar operates three high-volume manufacturing lines at a plant opened in 2003 in Perrysburg, Ohio, and has four lines at a plant in Frankfurt-Oder, Germany, opened in 
2007. It is building four new plants with a total of 16 production lines in Malaysia, expected to be in full swing by late 2009. 
Late last year, the company said it had orders for $6 billion of solar modules, enough to soak up most of its production from 2007 through 2012. Earlier this month, it reported that revenue had nearly quadrupled in 2007 and earnings had soared almost 40-fold from the year before. The stock price has risen so far so fast that some analysts advise caution. In late January, Wedbush Morgan Securities initiated coverage with a hold rating, noting that expected 
earnings for three years already are factored into First Solar's share price. 
Still, analyst Al Kaschalk at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles says First Solar is doing some smart things, such as offering solar modules to utilities willing to pay premium prices 

for resources that reach peak productivity when air-conditioning demand stresses the power grid. A year ago, the company announced a deal to furnish modules to a 40­megawatt solar plant in Germany. "They're picking off the edges of the market where they can help [boost the power] grid," Mr. Kaschalk says. 
When its Malaysia plants come on line, First Solar hopes to make solar modules that could produce as much as one gigawatt of power annually, more than tripling its current 

capacity. Its goal is to sell the modules wholesale for $1 per watt of capacity by 2012, compared with a cost of $2.48 per watt late last year. At $1 per watt, the prices would be 

competitive with other power sources without the government subsidies that support the solar industry now. 
Many industry observers expect solar power to become common, propelled by falling costs, a desire for greater domestic energy security and a push to address climate change 
by using nonfossil fuels. 

One drawback of solar technology is that it takes lots of modules spread over a large geographic area to make a significant amount of electricity. Project costs are driven by land and equipment costs. By contrast, a gas-fired power plant makes vast amounts of electricity from a small footprint. Fuel, not equipment or land, drives the cost.

Worst 1/3 Year Performer: Countrywide Financial 
Headquarters: Calabasas, Calif. 
CEO: Angelo Mozilo, since 1998 
Market Cap: $5.15 billion 
Revenue: $6.06 billion 
Net Loss: $704 million 
FOUR YEARS AGO, Countrywide Financial Corp.'s chairman and chief executive, Angelo Mozilo, set a goal of more than doubling the mortgage lender's market share by 2008. He 

dismissed suggestions that such a dash for growth might be risky. 
"I'm fairly confident that we're not going to do anything stupid," Mr. Mozilo said then. "We have a history of not doing anything stupid." 
Investors agreed -- and for a long spell they were richly rewarded. For the five years through Dec. 31, 2006, the return on Countrywide stock averaged about 35% annually, the 

best among general financial companies in last year's Shareholder Scoreboard. 

But Countrywide's aggressive lending caught up with the company in 2007. It is the worst one-year performer among the 1,000 companies in this year's Scoreboard, with a 
return of minus 78.4%. 
A $1,000 investment in Countrywide stock at the end of 2006 would have been worth just $216 a year later. 
The company's dismal performance last year also made it the worst performer for the three years through 2007. Its compound average annual return of minus 36.5% means 

that $1,000 invested at the end of 2004 would have been worth $256. 

Early last month, as its stock price plunged further, Countrywide accepted a takeover bid from Bank of America Corp. valuing the mortgage company at around $4 billion, more 
than 80% below its year- earlier value. 
Last year was extremely tough for nearly all mortgage companies. Hundreds of small to midsize lenders and brokers crashed out of business. But Countrywide, the largest U.S. 

home-mortgage lender by loan volume, had promised it would survive the shake-out and benefit from the elimination of rivals. Instead, Countrywide's errors in some ways 

made things worse. 
Determined to keep growing fast, the company loosened its lending standards even as the housing market started to wobble in 2005 and 2006. Countrywide's market share 
didn't get to Mr. Mozilo's goal of 30%, but it did rise to about 17% of home-loan originations in 2007 from 13% in 2004, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade 
publication. In retrospect, lenders would have been better off reducing their market share over the past couple of years. 

As defaults soared and home prices fell, Countrywide reported huge losses in the second half of last year. Despite drastic cost-cutting efforts, investors fretted about the 

company's ability to cope with growing default-related losses, lawsuits from shareholders and investigations by a variety of regulators. 
Countrywide became heavily reliant on commercial paper, a form of short-term debt that suddenly became unavailable last August when investors fled in near panic from 
mortgage-related risks. The company had eroded its capital base by buying back $2.4 billion of common shares in late 2006 and the first half of 2007. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Mozilo undermined confidence among investors by stepping up his sales of Countrywide shares acquired through the exercise of options that had long accounted for a large chunk of his compensation. He sold $130.6 million in company stock in the first half of 2007 through prearranged sales plans, up from $60.4 million in the year-earlier half, according to securities filings. The 69-year- old Mr. Mozilo has said the options were a tax-efficient way for the company to pay him. 
Some critics say the compensation plan was part of Countrywide's problem. The company put too much emphasis on stock options, says Mark M. Reilly, a partner at 3C­Compensation Consulting Consortium, Chicago. "This encourages too much risk-taking by executives to grow the business and protect the stock price," Mr. Reilly says. He says companies should require executives to keep half of any stock they receive from the company until they retire.

Best 3 Year Performer: Foster Wheeler 
Headquarters: Hamilton, Bermuda 
CEO: Raymond Milchovich, since 2001 
Market Cap: $11.14 billion 
Revenue: $3.50 billion* 
Net Income: 4262 million* 
*Fiscal year ended Dec. 29, 2006; 2007 results haven't been released 
BUOYANT ENERGY MARKETS and restructuring efforts helped make Foster Wheeler Ltd. a turnaround story. 
Just a few years ago, the engineering and construction company was reeling from losses caused by unprofitable projects and high operating costs in the 1990s. It also faced 

thousands of claims related to its construction of asbestos-encrusted boilers through the 1970s. 
Foster Wheeler was the worst 10-year performer in last year's Shareholder Scoreboard, with a compound average annual return of minus 21.6% for the decade through 2006. 
Now, Foster Wheeler is the best three-year performer, with a compound average annual return of 113.8% for the three years through Dec. 31. A $1,000 investment in Foster 

Wheeler stock at the end of 2004 would have been worth $9,768 at the end of last year, compared with $1,282 for a similar investment in the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index. 
Glimpses of change were evident in 2005 and 2006, when the stock returned 132% and 50%, respectively. In 2007, the return was 181.1%, making Foster Wheeler No. 8 
among the best one-year performers in this year's Scoreboard. 

"We are not done growing," says Raymond Milchovich, chairman and chief executive officer, who was brought in to turn around the company in late 2001. 
Foster Wheeler has benefited from the increasing demand for oil, natural gas and petrochemicals, which are the industries the company serves. The firm also has a power unit, 
which develops boilers that use alternative fuels such as agricultural and animal waste as well as coal. Mr. Milchovich says he expects that unit to be a big driver of earnings this 
year. 

The company's revenue and earnings jumped almost 60% in the first nine months of 2007. It expects to release fourth quarter and full- year 2007 results tomorrow. 
The company, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, and has operational headquarters in Clinton, N.J., does business in some 30 countries and gets nearly 80% of its revenue 

from outside North America. Hoping to further expand, the company has been hiring aggressively, cutting back on its debt -- to less than a fifth of the peak in 2002 -- and 
building up its cash reserves. "Number one priority for the cash...is acquisition targets," says Mr. Milchovich. 
Challenges remain. Amid a U.S. economic slowdown and a potential global slowdown, energy demand may decline and stall some projects -- though Mr. Milchovich believes 

developing economies like China and India will keep demand for oil and other fuels high for a long time. Foster Wheeler stock has fallen 1.6% so far this year, adjusted for a 2­
for-1 stock split last month. 
The company still has pending liabilities from asbestos-related claims, around $399 million at the end of September, down from $445 million a year earlier. Mr. Milchovich says 
insurance is expected to cover about $336 million of those claims. 

Investors are encouraged by the company's leadership. Shawn Driscoll, a stock analyst at money-management firm T. Rowe Price Group Inc., says managers have done a good job of picking appropriate projects and structuring contracts in a way that allows price increases as needed, thus keeping operating margins high. "This management team has really distinguished itself," says Mr. Driscoll. Several T. Rowe Price funds own the stock. 
-- Shefali Anand Best 5/10 Year Performer: Hansen Natural Headquarters Corona, Calif. CEO Rodney C. Sacks, since 1990 Market Cap $4.10 billion Revenue $605.8 million* Net Income $97.9 million* *Year ended Dec. 31, 2006; 2007 results haven't been released THERE IS A MONSTER behind Hansen Natural Corp.'s success. Monster Energy drink, that is, which helped make the beverage company the 10-year best performer among 1,000 companies in the Shareholder Scoreboard for the second 
year in a row. The stock had a compound average annual return of 69.5% for the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2007. 
An investment of $1,000 in Hansen stock at the end of 1997 would have been worth a whopping $195,489 a decade later, compared with $1,776 for a similar investment in the 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
Over the past decade, Hansen has reported steady double-digit annual revenue gains. Although the company also sells juices, smoothies, drink mixes and other beverages, 

energy drinks now account for about 80% of its profit. And since it introduced the Monster line of energy products in 2002, promising to deliver "twice the buzz" of a regular 

energy drink, the company has created almost a half-dozen more flavors. A coffee product called Java Monster was introduced last May and has been well-received. 
Hansen also ranks as the best five-year performer in this year's Scoreboard, with a compound average annual return of 142.5%. A $1,000 investment at the end of 2002 would 
have been worth $83,941, compared with $1,829 for the S&P 500. 

"This company has had a nice history of success with innovation," says Mark Astrachan, an analyst at the Stifel Nicolaus unit of Stifel Financial Corp., who rates the company a 

buy. "If you're expanding your product, it gets more people interested in it." 
Monster found a niche by marketing to sports fans in their teens and twenties. Market leader Red Bull GmbH found success by targeting the night-club scene. Other competitors 
took a broader approach, which Mr. Astrachan says stalled their growth. Monster rapidly gained market share among young consumers with a 16-ounce can that was perceived 
to be a better value than an eight-ounce can of Red Bull. 

Hansen has come a long way from its origins as a fruit-juice company in the 1930s, when Hubert Hansen and his three sons sold their beverages to film-studio retailers in Los Angeles. Last year, it struck a distribution deal with Anheuser-Busch Cos., allowing Monster to become available in more areas in the U.S. Most of Monster's recent volume growth has been in convenience stores and gas stations -- 55% growth last year, compared with 30% growth in grocery stores -- says Alton Stump a beverage analyst at Longbow Research in Cleveland. He ranks the stock a top buy. 
The company also announced plans to take Monster overseas, starting with the U.K. this year. 
But at least one analyst predicts slower growth for energy drinks. The booming energy-drink market may be reaching the saturation point, says John Sicher, editor and publisher 

of Beverage Digest, an industry publication and data service. Preliminary data show 30% volume growth last year, a modest slowdown from 2006. He expects slightly slower growth again this year as consumers become more interested in vitamin- enriched beverages. Mr. Stump predicts that over the next seven years, the growth rate in the U.S. will be comparable to the current 15% growth rate in Europe, where energy drinks were 
introduced about a decade earlier. Still, he estimates year-over-year volume growth of 20% for Monster drinks in 2008. 
After rising about 32% in 2007, Hansen's stock is down 1.1% so far this year, still better than the overall stock market. 
Meanwhile, Hansen raised Monster prices 6% in January. Analysts say customers likely will accept the higher prices because many other energy drinks already have gone up in 

price over the past two years.

Worst 5 Year Performer: Tenet Healthcare 
Headquarters Dallas 
CEO Trevor Fetter, since 2003 
Market Cap $2.40 billion 
Revenue $8.70 billion* 
Net Loss $803 million* 
*Year ended Dec. 31, 2006; 2007 results haven't been released. 
TENET HEALTHCARE CORP. is languishing in the recovery room, more than five years after the hospital operator's reputation was badly damaged by a wave of business 

scandals. 
In late 2002, Tenet's aggressive hospital pricing spurred a flurry of government investigations and private lawsuits. Revenue plunged after Tenet was forced to revise its pricing. 

Physicians began referring patients to rival hospitals. Managed-care companies demanded contract concessions and lower prices after discovering how much Tenet had been 
gouging them. The stock plunged. 
Trevor Fetter, who became chief executive officer in 2003, personally bought stock that year, confident the shares would rebound. "It wasn't clear at that point how deep and 

fundamental the problems were in the company," he says. 

The stock has continued to slide. It traded above $50 in October 2002, shortly before the scandal broke, fell to $16.40 by the end of that year and sank to a low of $3.06 last 
fall. The shares ended 2007 just over $5. 
For the second consecutive year, Dallas-based Tenet ranks as the worst five-year performer among 1,000 companies in the Shareholder Scoreboard. It also was the worst three-

year performer in last year's Scoreboard, as it was the year before. 

The compound average annual return on Tenet stock was minus 20.9% for the five years through 2007. A $1,000 investment in Tenet shares at the end of 2002 would have 
been worth just $310 at the end of last year, compared with $1,829 for a similar investment in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
Tenet hasn't been able to shake off its history. Most of the two dozen analysts who follow the company remain negative or neutral. 
But some positive signs in the second half of 2007 spurred two analysts to raise their recommendations early this year. Its continuing focus on improving hospital quality 

appears to be helping it gain rate increases from managed-care companies. 

"Tenet is on much more solid footing with managed-care payers," said Darren Lehrich, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. He issued a "buy" rating on Tenet in mid-January, although 
he says his decision was partly motivated by contrarian instincts. "It's not so much that we love Tenet as it is that Wall Street hates Tenet too much," he says. 
Lehman Brothers analyst Adam Feinstein recently upgraded Tenet to "equal weight," the equivalent of neutral, from "underweight," or the equivalent of a sell, citing improved 

managed-care pricing and operational stability. 
In last year's third quarter, says Mr. Fetter, the Tenet CEO, "we started demonstrating better economic trends," including a slowdown in the decline in patient volume. 
Investments in facilities improvements and moves to rebuild physician relationships also are starting to pay off, he says. In a conference call with analysts scheduled for 

tomorrow, when the company announces fourth-quarter and full-year results, "we'll give statistics and proof points relating to how we're putting the company back on a growth 
track," he adds. 
On top of its past mistakes, Tenet has been a victim of industry headwinds as well as pure bad luck, notes Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC. Tenet's 

operations in Florida have yet to recover from the effects of Hurricane Wilma in 2005. 

Ms. Skolnick turned positive on Tenet in August 2006 and is sticking by her view that Tenet finally has the right management team and is on the mend. "The signal is that Tenet 

is out of the penalty box of managed care," she said recently. "Now let's see if we can get the stock out of the penalty box [of investors]."

Worst 10 Year Performer: Rite Aid 

Headquarters Camp Hill, Pa. 

CEO Mary Sammons, since 2003 

Market Cap $2.20 billion 

Revenue $17.51 billion* 

Net Income $26.8 million* 

*Fiscal year ended March 3, 2007 

IN MANY WAYS, Rite Aid Corp. has moved past an accounting-fraud scandal in the late 1990s that sent former executives to prison and left the company near bankruptcy. 

A new management team, installed after the fraud was revealed, has repaired supplier relations and whittled down debt to stabilize the company. Rite Aid's $3.4 billion purchase 

of the Brooks and Eckerd chains in June was aimed at improving the company's ability to compete with drugstore leaders CVS Caremark Corp. and Walgreen Co. 
But Rite Aid still can't escape the past. The accounting fraud artificially pumped up its stock, to a high of $50.94 in January 1999, reflecting strong earnings that proved to be 
fabricated. After an investigation, an earnings restatement wiped out $1.6 billion of profit from the late 1990s. The stock plunged and has languished below $10 a share since 
2002. It ended last year at $2.79. 

Rite Aid is the worst 10-year performer among 1,000 companies in this year's Shareholder Scoreboard, with a compound average annual return of minus 20.7% for the decade through Dec. 31. A $1,000 investment in Rite Aid stock at the end of 1997 would have been worth just $98 at the end of last year. The same amount invested in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have grown to $1,776. 
Rite Aid also was the worst 10-year performer in the 2005 Scoreboard and the worst three-year performer in the 2002 rankings. 
This year will be crucial for Rite Aid's plans to integrate the 1,854 Brooks and Eckerd stores it purchased. Rite Aid is remodeling the acquired stores and stocking them with its own private-label products. As a larger player, the chain expects to become more efficient and secure lower drug prices from suppliers. 
Overall, the outlook for drugstore chains is bright. Aging U.S. consumers are taking more medicines and buying more generic drugs, which produce greater profit margins for the stores than brand-name pills. The Medicare Part D benefit has boosted the number of prescriptions filled. 
But competition is fierce, and government reimbursements are shrinking. The economy, too, is a growing concern. Since October, shares of Rite Aid and other drugstores have dropped sharply, as investors fret about consumer spending. Rite Aid, in particular, has been hurt by worries about its sluggish sales and still-high debt levels. On Dec. 20, Rite Aid shares fell 32%, their biggest one-day percentage decline in more than eight years, when the company reported a loss for its fiscal third quarter and again lowered its outlook for the fiscal year, citing acquisition costs, a mild cold and flu season, and weak holiday sales. 
In early January, Rite Aid, CVS and Walgreen reported disappointing December sales, blaming the weak flu season, bad weather and a troubled economy. Share prices dropped, and Rite Aid is down 6.5% so far this year. To attract customers, Rite Aid is pushing lower-priced items in its advertising. 
"It's unfortunate that the whole economic climate turned the way it did, right in the middle of what we're doing," Chief Executive Mary Sammons says. "It would not be wise to go into the year thinking it's going to all of a sudden get better."

Abstract 
Biotechnology holds the potential for more efficient oil production from plant life using less land and/or non-arable land while providing a reverse course for global warming, deforestation, air toxics and acid rain and a radical shift in the power of dictatorial regimes that control oil reserves. 

Full Text 
The editorial "Greenhouse Affect" (Feb. 13) is another example of rhetoric replacing accomplishment in the U.S. No matter who does something today there will arise a loud voice criticizing errors followed by aspersions on character tomorrow. It comes from all sides. The oil companies are evil to all on the left and to some others. Drug companies come in for their share of this from such as Sen. John McCain. 
Our country greatly admired inventors in the 19th century, from Eli Whitney to John Ericsson, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and others. In the first half of the 20th century it shifted to doers such as Henry Ford, George Westinghouse and Harvey Firestone. Somehow, esteem has moved away from those who really make or do anything. Regard has shifted to those who comment on the errors of anyone who tries to truly fix a problem. 
The negative spirit has infiltrated the corporation. Scott Adams's cartoon, "Dilbert," describes this well. Dilbert would not be so hilariously funny if it were not so tragically accurate. 
In previous times a team of oil people, coal miners, inventors and entrepreneurs would get together and solve the problem with action. Any such endeavor now is sure to give rise to nasty comments from one side or both in the chattering class. 
Academic reports simply point to the need for more research (i.e., we want another grant). Bureaucrats thrive as their particular problem worsens (we need to hire more). We need real solutions.

The recent backlash directed at renewable fuels is as full of hyperbole as the initial support was. I was originally concerned that people would see biofuels as a panacea to 
foreign oil dependence. Now my concern is that people will believe the use of biofuels causes more environmental harm than petroleum. Neither is the case. 
Biofuels are a viable, environmentally friendly, moral supplement that we can continue to use until more efficient and economical alternatives are developed to solve the world's 
energy needs. 

Alex Pirkl 
Blooming Prairie, Minn. 

Your editorial, based on two recent scientific papers, completely misses the mark. Both papers are deeply flawed and focus primarily on corn ethanol, about which their general 
point is about right. 
There are differences between ethanol and biodiesel, and even within each biofuel differences depending on their feed materials. 

The productivity improvements for producing fuel through biotechnology may rival improvements that have come in computer processor chips over the last 10 to 15 years. 
Biotechnology holds the potential for more efficient oil production from plant life using less land and/or non-arable land while providing a reverse course for global warming, 
deforestation, air toxics and acid rain and a radical shift in the power of dictatorial regimes that control oil reserves. 

Supporting biodiesel production will help move the U.S. to energy independence. It will reduce dollars going to such unstable or dictatorial regimes as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria, Iraq and Iran, increase global security by reducing the U.S.'s need to defend international oil flows. It will also dry up petrodollars which "leak" to al Qaeda and other sworn enemies of the U.S. It will help support the flagging dollar by reducing the gush of dollars out of the U.S. for oil.

Abstract 
"If city government does not show leadership by its use of renewable energy and energy-efficiency solutions, it is hard to have credibility with its constituents in being a good steward of the environment," says John Berger, chief executive officer of Standard Renewable Energy, a Houston-based provider of solar, wind and other alternative energies. The City Hall garden, completed in 2001, covers about 20,000 square feet of the roof, using more than 100 hardy species that can withstand Chicago's fierce winds and temperature extremes.

[Local governments around the globe are coming up with some of the most innovative ways to cut energy use. There are lessons here for places of all sizes.] 
Ann Arbor, Mich., and Beijing, China, have precious little in common. But the modest college town and sprawling national capital do share one trait: They're part of a world-wide movement by cities to rein in their runaway energy use. 
Ann Arbor is replacing the bulbs in its street lamps with light- emitting diodes that use much less power. Beijing is closing or relocating cement kilns, coal mines and chemical plants dating back to the era of Chairman Mao. 
Elsewhere around the world, cities are embarking on all sorts of innovative programs to try to corral the amount of energy they consume. Chicago is planting rooftop gardens to cool down its municipal buildings. New York is working with a private company to harness the power of tidal currents in the city's East River. Amsterdam is using cold lake water to help air-condition homes. 
"We have the beginnings of a mass movement among municipal leaders," says Ralph Cavanagh, energy-program co-director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. 
For cities, the motivation is twofold. All the hand-wringing over climate change has prompted more cities to do their part to contain greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists believe are causing global warming. In the U.S., more than 700 mayors have signed an agreement to try to follow the Kyoto Protocol's goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- even though the Senate has rejected the treaty. 
The other major motivation for cities: energy costs, which have more than doubled since 2000. Strapped for cash, municipalities are scrambling to save as much money on energy use as they can. 
Although city governments themselves use a fraction of energy consumed in a municipality, industry experts say they play a crucial leadership role in getting others to conserve. 
"If city government does not show leadership by its use of renewable energy and energy-efficiency solutions, it is hard to have credibility with its constituents in being a good steward of the environment," says John Berger, chief executive officer of Standard Renewable Energy, a Houston-based provider of solar, wind and other alternative energies. 
Here's a look at the innovative programs nine cities around the world are using to keep their energy consumption -- and their skyrocketing bills -- under control. 
CHICAGO 
LET YOUR GARDEN GROW 
About eight years ago, the Windy City began overhauling 15 million square feet of its municipal buildings to make them use less power. On many of the buildings, city officials decided to put in a novel feature: rooftop gardens. 
The first was planted atop the 11-story Chicago City Hall, a nearly century-old landmark where the temperature on the roof -- as on many other downtown buildings -- would soar to as high as 160 degrees on hot days. Gardens can keep a roof as much as 70 degrees cooler, city officials say, because all the greenery reflects heat while providing shade. Consequently, less energy is needed to keep a building cool. 
The City Hall garden, completed in 2001, covers about 20,000 square feet of the roof, using more than 100 hardy species that can withstand Chicago's fierce winds and temperature extremes. The savings were felt immediately, with the annual power bill for the building falling by 11%, or almost $10,000, city officials estimate. 
Since then, the city has expanded the green-roof program dramatically. Now 4 million square feet of municipal and private rooftops either have a roof garden or are in the process of getting one, says Suzanne Malec-McKenna, Chicago's commissioner of the environment. In so doing, Ms. Malec-McKenna says, the city has made sure to use lightweight, permeable soils to keep the rooftops from becoming too overloaded. Waterproof membranes are also fitted below the garden to keep rain runoff and other water from leaking into the building. 
A different kind of problem cropped up on the City Hall roof soon after it was finished. "We had a grasshopper invasion," Ms. Malec- McKenna says. "But thankfully the birds got them."

LIGHTING THE WAY 
Officials in this town of 115,000 near Detroit took a close look at their $5 million-a-year municipal electrical bill two years ago and realized they were shelling out $1.5 million -­or roughly a third of the total -- just for street lights. Then they realized they could save substantially by simply swapping standard bulbs for a newer technology: light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. 
Unlike standard lights that use heated, incandescent bulbs, LED light is cooler and is produced by a semiconductor. The bulbs last as long as 10 years, or five times longer than traditional lights, while using about half as much energy, Ann Arbor officials say. 
The LED technology has been around for decades, and the lights have become common in computer indicators and traffic lights. But until about two years ago, LEDs weren't practical for street-lighting purposes because it was difficult for them to produce white light, says Govi Rao, charman of Lighting Science Group Corp., a New York- based LED provider. 
In 2005, Ann Arbor tried out one technique for making white light: blending red, green and blue beams. City officials installed some of the makeshift lights in the City Hall parking lot. "They looked like they were cobbled in somebody's garage," recalls David Konkle, energy coordinator for the city. 
Then manufacturers came to the rescue, developing aesthetically pleasing white bulbs by coating blue LEDs with phosphor. City officials spent $15,000 to install the new lights on a few streets downtown and in a residential neighborhood. 
One of the few complaints was from a resident who said the new lighting no longer illuminated his home on the street; LEDs shine light directionally and are typically pointed down at the ground, unlike incandescent bulbs, which cast a glow all around. "We told him we're not in the business of lighting his home," Mr. Konkle says. 
Most other people liked the new LEDs, and the city recently obtained a $630,000 grant from the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority to replace all 1,046 of the street lights downtown. The city estimates that replacing the downtown street lights alone will save more than $100,000 in reduced power costs annually as well as 294 tons of carbon-dioxide emissions -- equivalent to the carbon dioxide that about 35 homes generate annually from electricity use. 
After that, Mr. Konkle says, the rest of the city's lights will be replaced as the technology develops and prices drop. City officials say they could cut their light bill by as much as $700,000 a year by replacing all of the 7,000 or so streetlights in town.

PALM DESERT, CALIF. 
A COMMUNITY EFFORT 
In 2005, Jim Ferguson, then the mayor of this desert city, was traveling across Northern Europe to investigate the region's energy- saving programs. A host of California leaders and utility executives were along on the fact-finding trip, but for Mr. Ferguson the energy problem hit home particularly hard: Power bills in Palm Desert had skyrocketed to as much as $1,000 for residents in hot summer months. 
As the cruise ship made its way across the Baltic Sea, Mr. Ferguson recalls turning to some California utility executives and saying: "If you can save us money, then do it." 
With the gauntlet laid down, two local utilities, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co. and Sempra Energy's Southern California Gas Co., formed a partnership with the city and a nonprofit for help. The Energy Coalition, of Irvine, Calif., helps cities and utilities work together to reduce energy consumption. Together, the partners devised a plan that would help slash Palm Desert's energy consumption by 30% by 2011 -- and achieve as much as $40 million in annual energy savings. 
The plan is one of the most audacious arrangements devised for a U.S. city, since the cuts weren't just coming from municipal operations but from the city of 50,000 as a whole. Adding to the challenge: Palm Desert is a fast-growing resort community with 30,000 homes, 22 golf courses and more than a dozen hotels -- and it's situated in one of the hottest climates in the U.S., with summertime temperatures approaching 120 degrees. That means a lot of power for a lot of air conditioners. 
Under the partnership, the utilities obtained $14 million in grants from the California Public Utilities Commission earmarked for use in Palm Desert to finance one of the nation's most aggressive incentive programs for homes and businesses to replace outmoded, energy-guzzling gizmos with energy-saving ones. 
Unsurprisingly, air conditioners are one of the biggest parts of the plan. It can cost as much as $1,200 a month for the four or so hottest months of the year to keep older models humming in a three-bedroom home. Palm Desert now gives residents rebates of up to $1,400 per system when they buy new, energy-efficient air-conditioning setups, which can run between $5,000 and $9,000. Since the new air conditioners can save as much as half the power of the older ones, city officials say, they pay for themselves in four to six years. Last year, 493 new systems were installed under the program. 
After one full year of the program, which began in January 2007, the city has saved 27 million kilowatt-hours of power, or 12% towards its goal, says Patrick Conlon, director of energy management for Palm Desert. The effort has removed about 3,475 tons of carbon from the air -- equivalent to the carbon dioxide that 1,531 homes generate annually from electricity use. "What we are trying to do is open up [residents'] wallets and invest in energy efficiency, and that's hard to do," Mr. Conlon says. "But everybody understands dollars, and when they get a $1,200 electric bill they understand that."

AMSTERDAM 
LOOKING TO THE LAKE 
In 2001, the Zuidas section of Amsterdam, south of the central city, was seeing lots of new development. As Zuidas grew, local leaders wanted to keep emissions down and help the city -- and the Netherlands as a whole -- meet Kyoto Protocol objectives. So the Dutch capital set an ambitious target: Zuidas would have to use 40% less energy than other parts of the city. 
It would be a challenge. The high-density development would have big energy demands -- particularly since about 45% of the buildings would be used for businesses. 
"There were lots of companies investing, making plans," says Ronald Roelen, business manager at Nuon Warmte, the subsidiary of Amsterdam- based utility Nuon that's responsible for Zuidas. "Amsterdam wanted to be the center of the IT world and needs a lot of electricity; the question was, how can we avoid making huge investments into electricity?" 
Nuon zeroed in on air conditioning. About 37% of the total power load in Zuidas was expected to be used for cooling computer rooms and other high-tech necessities. Using a pilot project in Stockholm as a model, Nuon decided to cut down on all that power use -- by harnessing a local man-made lake, Nieuwe Meer. 
The system, which came on line in August 2006, starts by removing water from about 100 feet below the surface of the lake. At that level, the temperature is usually a chilly 41 to 45 degrees. This water is pumped away and used to cool another supply of water that is then pumped into customers' buildings. There, it radiates cool air through the pipes ­
- much like hot-water pipes give off heat to warm a building. The lake water, meanwhile, is returned to Nieuwe Meer. 
The project, which provides air conditioning for about 700,000 people in the southern part of Zuidas, saves 200,000 euros ($292,000) a year in electricity costs and uses just one-tenth the power of conventional cooling systems, Nuon says. The utility provided most of the investment for the roughly 25 million euro effort, with a subsidy of 900,000 euros from the Dutch government. 
Now there are plans to expand the project to the northern part of the Zuidas area. Officials also are considering a similar project for the district Amsterdam Zuidoost Lob, in the southeastern part of the city, using water from another lake.

BEIJING 
OUT WITH THE OLD 
As part of its action plan for hosting the Olympics, Beijing targeted deep cuts in energy consumption. And it had a string of industrial relics from the city's former planned economy squarely in its sights. 
Cement kilns, coal mines and chemical plants dating back to the era of Chairman Mao were earmarked for relocation or closure so that Beijing could lower its energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product by more than 6% annually by 2008. (That measure represents the ratio of China's total energy use, in tons of coal equivalent to its GDP, in yuan.) Part of the motivation was simple conservation of resources. China has been gobbling up coal at an enormous rate, as the nation's recent shortages -- and resulting power outages -- show. 
Pollution worries were also driving Beijing's campaign; conditions were so bad that the International Olympic Committee talked of a need for contingency plans to protect athletes' health, possibly by postponing events on smoggy days. 
To achieve Beijing's goals, some big employers are getting the boot. The Beijing Coking and Chemistry Plant, built in 1959, shuttered in July 2006. Last year, Beijing Huaer Co.'s chemical plant and the Beijing Organic Chemical Plant were targeted to be moved out of town within a year of the games' beginning. Scores of coal mines will be shut, and a ban was imposed on cement kilns inside the city's fifth ring road -- about 7 miles from the city proper. 
The biggest challenge lay about 11 miles west of Tiananmen Square: Shougang Group's vast steelworks. A major employer in the city, the steelworks has been a source of civic pride for decades despite its inefficiency and the smoke emitted from its chimneys. Production at the plant is being wound down for the Olympics, with annual output due to halve to 4.2 million metric tons of steel during 2008. Operations will cease in 2010 and move to a new, more-efficient facility some 137 miles away at Caofeidian in Hebei province. Part of the new plant will be ready for production in October, to make up for the shrinking capacity in Beijing. 
But relocating Shougang's steelworks involves complex technical and political challenges -- not least the impact on more than 60,000 Beijing-based workers who may need to be relocated or change their jobs. How to split taxes from steel production between Beijing and Hebei is another issue. 
Beijing hopes to absorb some of the displaced workers from the environmental drive into the city's booming service sector. Municipal officials also plan to salve civic pride by making Shougang's steelworks a memorial to the capital's industrial development -- including progress in energy efficiency -- by turning it into a tourist attraction once production ends. 
The city's efforts are paying off. For years, Beijing had the highest energy consumption in China. But its efficiency drive -- equivalent to taking two 500-megawatt power plants offline each year -- has dropped Beijing behind Shanghai in terms of consumption.

LONDON 
POWER CLOSER TO HOME 
By 2025, London Mayor Ken Livingstone wants to cut London's carbon emissions 60% from their 1990 levels. His plan: move a quarter of the city's power supply to small, local energy sources and away from the national electric grid. 
Producing electricity nearer the point of use means you don't have to use as much energy to deliver the power to customers, and less of the electricity bleeds away in transit. It also means that heat created as a byproduct of energy production can be used to warm customers' buildings. If plants are located far from customers, that heat cools down in transit. 
The city has a number of projects in the works to achieve that goal. To develop them, the city's climate-change agency has teamed up with the U.K. unit of the French utility EDF to create London Energy Services Co., or London ESCO. 
EDF Energy says the driving force behind the local-power venture will be combined heat-and-power plants, along with conventional gas- fired plants. As part of the effort, London ESCO says it is also considering investing in a large-scale wind farm, as well as a plant that combines power generation with both heating and cooling. The plant creates heat as a byproduct, as heat-and-power plants do, but also cool air -- which can be used in local air-conditioning systems. 
The company estimates that projects already in the pipeline will be able to meet about 2% of London's energy needs. The first plant is expected to come on line as early as 2009. 
Meanwhile, London ESCO is one of the three short-listed bidders for a project in the Elephant and Castle area of London. The proposed new plant will have up to 9 megawatts of capacity and will supply heat, cooling and electricity to about 6,500 local homes.

ASPEN, COLO. 
Few cities have more at stake in global warming than this skiing mecca, whose main livelihood -- winter sports -- is directly threatened by forecasts of shrinking snow packs in the Rocky Mountain West. 
So, in 2005, officials in the upscale town of 6,000 decided to adopt a plan called the Canary Initiative -- so named because the town sees itself as a canary in the environmental coal mine. The plan called for the city to dramatically ramp up its use of alternative energy and take other steps to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions 80% by 2050. 
A major part of the plan involves the Aspen Recreation Center, a three-story structure that houses swimming pools, an ice rink and other athletic facilities. Last August, Aspen launched a $1.1 million retrofit of the center to cut its hefty power use. The two pools and a hot tub, for instance, got new covers so they don't lose heat at night and have to be reheated in the morning. The facility also was outfitted with energy-efficient climate-control units and timed electrical controls. For instance, vending machines now have sensors, so the lights turn on only if someone is in the room, says Tim Anderson, the city's recreation director. 
Mr. Anderson says the city will benefit economically from the project, with the annual energy bill for the center dropping by nearly 40%, or $130,000, from its usual $350,000. The overhaul will also save 713,207 kilowatt-hours of power annually, or enough to supply 85 average Colorado homes for a year. As for carbon dioxide, the new designs will keep about 640 tons of the gas out of the air every year, about the same as 77 homes generate annually from electricity use.

NEW YORK 
TAPPING THE WAVES 
In December 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced an ambitious plan for New York: By 2030, the nation's largest city would cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 30%. As part of the plan, Mr. Bloomberg called for 800 megawatts of new clean-energy generation, or enough to power about 640,000 homes. One company is working with the city to help reach that goal. Its unorthodox idea: harness the power of waves in New York's East River to generate electricity. 
On June 11 of last year, Mr. Bloomberg helped flip the switch on an experimental tidal plant in the waterway. Since then, the five turbines submerged in 30 feet of water have been producing enough power to meet nearly a third of the electricity needs of a supermarket and parking garage on Roosevelt Island, between the New York boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The turbines are equipped with three 16-foot diameter rotors, which spin like the blades of a windmill when the tidal currents rush through the East River at regular intervals every day. 
The pilot project by Verdant Power Inc. has worked so well that officials of the New York-based start-up say they plan to seek a federal operating license later this year to install more underwater turbines. A total of 30 are on the drawing board; they would be capable of generating up to 1.5 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 800 homes. 
City officials, who helped underwrite environmental studies for the project and have streamlined the permitting process, say as many as 300 turbines could eventually be installed in the East River, providing 10 megawatts of renewable power, or enough to power about 8,000 homes. That power, city officials say, could replace the equivalent of 68,000 barrels of oil a year. 
But wave power isn't without its challenges. Regulatory barriers are so large, for example, that it can take years to get a permit to build one. Verdant Power wasn't able to get its turbines actually up and running until last year after spending five years seeking state and federal permits. The costs are also high: Verdant Power officials say the East River project has cost a total of about $9 million, with the state of New York footing the bill for about a third of that. 
So far, one fear of environmentalists isn't materializing: that blades of the turbines would hurt fish. In the East River project, Mr. Taylor says, the blades spin so slowly that fish just swim out of the way.

THANE, INDIA 
FOLLOW THE SUN 
A little-known suburb of India's financial center, Mumbai, is aspiring to become the face of the nation's renewable-energy efforts. Thane, like other Indian cities, depends on the power generated from the country's vast coal resources. And, like other cities, it's struggling to meet the growing demand of its population -- which usually means one to four hours of blackouts every day. 
To cope with the problem, many Indian cities offer incentives such as property-tax rebates to get residents to install solar-water heaters. But Thane, an industrial city of about 
1.5 million people, has been much more aggressive than other municipalities. Not only is it encouraging residents to take up solar power -- it is using the renewable energy extensively in its own buildings. 
"We saw a big potential in energy conservation and the use of solar power in tackling the power shortage in the city and decided to make the most of it," says deputy city engineer (electrical) Sunil Pote. 
The local administration started its solar drive in 2003 with a project at its main hospital. Facing a huge electricity bill, the administration decided to install solar water heaters at the facility, with a capacity of about 4,760 gallons a day. The $40,500 or so investment made five years ago saves the hospital about $23,500 a year in electricity costs and meets all of its hot-water needs. The energy saved is enough to power about 45 homes. 
The success of the project and the savings it generated prompted the administration to move on to its other buildings. During the refitting drive, local officials installed a total of about 8,850 gallons a day of solar water-heater units. 
Then the city decided to get residents in on the effort, as well. Beginning in May 2005, the administration made it mandatory for builders to fit all new buildings with solar water heaters. "We wanted people to see the cost benefits of using solar energy, so we took a different approach," Mr. Pote says. "Before we made it mandatory, people were reluctant to use solar water heaters, as there was a misconception that they are expensive to install." 
Meanwhile, to encourage existing buildings owners to install solar water heaters, the city began offering a 10% discount on property tax every year for adding the hardware. 
Since the program began, 16,300 families in the city have connected to solar water heaters, Mr. Pote says. With those efforts, the city today saves enough electricity to power more than 5,000 homes. "This is still a small fraction," Mr. Pote adds. "If we can get at least 25% of the families to start using solar water heaters, we can reduce the city's total electricity consumption by almost 15%."

Global Warming: 
At U.N., Investors Try to Divine 
How Soon U.S. Will Go Green 
By Keith Johnson 
Hundreds of big investors and top executives will descend on the United Nations headquarters next Thursday to grapple with Wall Street's latest fashionable worry: how global warming is affecting the climate -- for investing. 
Investors are increasingly trying to come to grips with the uncertainty about how the U.S. government will address the issue of global warming, and what effects that will have on businesses from power companies to insurers. 
Granted, talk is cheap at climate-change investment gatherings. Next week's shindig -- the third of its kind in five years -- is organized by the United Nations Foundation and Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups that's pushed companies for more than a decade to make green issues a priority. In 2005, most of the same faces at the summit signed on to a plan to "manage climate risk and capture opportunities." 
But just like the "tipping points" that many scientists point to in the Earth's changing climate, investor interest in how to play global warming seems to be gathering steam. 
Investors are taking a more proactive role. Last week, three big banks said they'll toughen financing standards for coal-fired power plants that could come under fire from new environmental regulations. 
Increasingly, the accent is on business opportunities presented by the world's efforts to rein in global warming. Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG have set out to identify which companies help the world adapt to changing climate, such as water-treatment companies, as well as businesses that can help mitigate further climate change, like clean-energy firms. 
Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings PLC and Credit Suisse Group recently launched "global warming" indexes and funds that track those kinds of companies. Those banks and other titans such as Merrill Lynch & Co. are increasingly active in the $40 billion market trading carbon- dioxide emissions rights. 
Executives from Lehman, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Corp. and AIG Investments, as well as state pension funds, will attend the Valentine's Day summit, which features Al Gore as keynote speaker at a closed-door luncheon and discussions such as "Unleashing the Business Potential for Clean Energy." 
Their main goal: to divine how the U.S. will deal with climate change, and -- as much as possible -- to shape that response. So far, the U.S. has largely stayed out of the global climate-change regime. It didn't ratify the Kyoto Protocol or implement any mandatory cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, as European countries did. 
Congress is mulling over a half-dozen bills outlining different ways the U.S. could curb its emissions of greenhouse gasses or promote cleaner forms of energy. No one knows what will ultimately prevail, or when. That uncertainty unnerves many companies; many of the largest U.S. corporations, grouped into the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, clamor for prompt government action. 
That hasn't sat well with all investors. The Free Enterprise Action Fund has in the past year targeted General Electric Co. , Procter & Gamble Co., Caterpillar Inc., DuPont Co., Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Sachs for basing business decisions on climate-change fears. This week, the SEC blocked a bid by Lehman to squelch the fund's questions about global warming and business. 
Foreign Policy: 
Bush to Trumpet African Successes as Crises Cast Shadows 
By John D. McKinnon President Bush starts a victory lap across Africa next week, celebrating his little-noticed but successful fights there against AIDS and malaria. But he also will be running hard to avoid the shadow of a growing number of political crises and controversies in the region. 
As Mr. Bush enters his final 12 months in office, advocates are praising his campaign to battle disease and promote economic growth in poor countries, especially in Africa. It has emerged as a bright spot in a foreign-policy legacy marred by controversy over the Iraq war. 
Bono, the Irish rock star turned global gadfly, once said that Mr. Bush has done "an incredible job" with his AIDS campaign. As it nears the end of its first five years, it has put 
1.4 million people on life-sustaining therapies at a cost to the U.S. of more than $15 billion. The Bono-affiliated ONE campaign broadened its praise last month, saying Mr. Bush deserves credit for his fights against malaria and extreme poverty in the region. The White House hopes the trip will lock in congressional support for his initiatives, particularly as he is seeking a doubling of funding for combating AIDS to $30 billion over the next five years. 
The president's visit begins on Saturday in the tiny West African nation of Benin. Then he travels to Tanzania and Rwanda in East Africa and returns to Ghana and Liberia in West Africa. 
"President Bush made Africa a priority early on, has followed through on his initiatives and is driven by a desire to make sure that these programs, which are working, stay in place after he leaves office," said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. 
At the same time, Mr. Bush is likely to face questions about a range of dicey political issues in trouble spots such as Darfur, Sudan; Kenya; Chad; and Zimbabwe. Critics say Mr. Bush is likely to try to avoid some of the region's seemingly intractable problems, particularly those related to ethnic strife. They say the White House hasn't invested enough energy in diplomacy in Africa, particularly in comparison with its investment in economic development and disease relief. 
Stephen Morrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, defends the administration's approach. "It's rather a question of not preferring to make these really tough, complex crises the centerpiece of the trip. But it's unavoidable that they're going to have to talk about this." 
Foreign-policy analysts believe the administration launched its big AIDS and malaria campaigns in part to counter criticism of America's foreign-policy moves elsewhere. White House aides disagree, saying Mr. Bush has always viewed fostering development in poor countries as a moral imperative. In the wake of 9/11, it also has become a security goal, they say. 
One result is that the U.S. is unusually popular in most of sub- Saharan Africa, even as America's standing has dropped elsewhere in the world, particularly in predominantly Muslim countries. Three African countries, including Ghana, view the U.S. even more favorably than people in the U.S. do, according to a recent report by the Pew Global Attitudes Project. The U.S. enjoys its highest favorable- opinion rating anywhere in the world in the West African nation of Ivory Coast, at 88%. 
A song that has been popular among Liberians in the U.S. sums up attitudes toward that country's benefactors: "Give me a one way ticket to Monrovia/I'm never coming back/Thank you papa Kofi Annan/Thank you George Bush." 
Banking: 
Credit Suisse to Reveal if It Dodged the Write-Down Bullet 
By Katharina Bart 
As Citigroup Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., UBS AG and other major banks have taken tens of billions of dollars in losses on mortgage securities gone bad, Credit Suisse Group has thus far escaped largely unscathed. 
Tuesday, investors will get the first tangible sign of whether the Swiss bank's luck held in the fourth quarter. 
The bank's conservative tone is in contrast to its reputation for placing -- and occasionally losing -- big bets. Credit Suisse's CSFB unit suffered heavy losses from emerging markets and real estate in the late 1990s, part of what later management labeled a "casino mentality." 
But in the past two years, Credit Suisse has reinvented itself, partly under Chief Executive Brady Dougan, who took over last year. It has done away with the individual fiefdoms of the past, opting for a more closely managed bank. In the process, Credit Suisse has shown itself to be one of the more savvy risk-takers among investment banks -- in contrast to traditionally conservative Swiss rival UBS, which has announced write-downs of $18 billion, largely on mortgage investments. 
While analysts don't expect an unblemished quarter from Credit Suisse, if the write-downs were large enough to hit earnings significantly, the bank would have been forced to disclose the losses previously. In the third quarter, Credit Suisse wrote down 2.2 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion), half on mortgage investments and half on loans it made to buyout firms but was unable to sell to investors. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the write-downs Friday. 
Like many European banks, Credit Suisse has provided little information about exactly what kinds of investments it is holding and how it has protected itself against losses. Credit Suisse said it reined in its mortgage-security business far earlier than rivals, but the bank remains exposed in other investment-banking areas, such as buyout loans. 
At the end of September, Credit Suisse held $52 billion in buyout loans, an amount that has been reduced since then, although the bank has never disclosed to what level. Credit Suisse also has never disclosed its exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities, an area in which the bank has traditionally been a strong participant and which analysts believe was responsible for added losses at UBS in the fourth quarter. 
With jitters about the extent of banks' potential troubles increasing, analysts and investors will be pressing Credit Suisse to come clean.

Candidates Mobilize as Race Grinds On; McCain's Breaks With GOP Leave Scars But Could Increase His Electability

Abstract 
Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., in a newsletter to clients this week, wrote that "market participants should be aware of areas in which Senator McCain differs from most Republicans, including pharmaceutical and tobacco regulation and climate change legislation." The newsletter said industries that would normally benefit from Republican control "might not enjoy as benign a political and regulatory environment under a McCain Administration as they have under the Bush Administration, judging from McCain's policy stances while in the Senate." 

Full text 
John McCain has long acknowledged he'd never be elected "Miss Congeniality" by fellow Republicans, yet he is all but certain to become their presidential nominee. 
Rarely has a party's pick made so many enemies along the way, from church pews to corporate boardrooms. Many Christian conservatives mistrust him, while his battles with major business interests -- energy, tobacco, cable and more -- are Senate legend. 
Yet the Arizona senator's biggest breaks with his party, from campaign finance to illegal immigration, also contribute to making him Republicans' most electable candidate: He's more appealing to the independent voters who are crucial for victory, and to the nation's fastest-growing demographic group, Latinos. 
For enough Republicans, it seems, that's reason enough to hold their noses. 
"He has the best chance, whoever the Democratic nominee is," says Tre Everson, a 34-year-old funeral director from Franklin, Tenn., who voted Tuesday in his state's Republican primary. "I don't agree with Sen. McCain 100% of the time, but I agree with him most of the time." 
Likewise, past Senate adversaries, such as Mississippi's Trent Lott, have joined the McCain campaign -- though another Mississippi Republican senator, Thad Cochran, recently told a reporter, "The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine." 
Sen. McCain linked the Cochran comment to their spats over spending "earmarks," the provisions for special projects that many lawmakers include in the annual government appropriations measures. Sen. McCain's opposition to earmarks has vexed many colleagues over the years, but buys him peace with some fiscal conservatives. 
Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., in a newsletter to clients this week, wrote that "market participants should be aware of areas in which Senator McCain differs from most Republicans, including pharmaceutical and tobacco regulation and climate change legislation." 
The newsletter said industries that would normally benefit from Republican control "might not enjoy as benign a political and regulatory environment under a McCain Administration as they have under the Bush Administration, judging from McCain's policy stances while in the Senate." 
The ISI Group, a New York brokerage firm, likewise circulated its "Buyer Beware" analysis: "If there was a bill negative for HMOs or pharmaceutical companies during the past eight years, chances were good that John McCain was the Republican sponsor." Utilities and coal companies also are "at risk," the analysis said, since Sen. McCain -- like the Democratic candidates -- supports legislation creating a cap- and-trade system for limiting carbon emissions. 
While some businesspeople might fear a Democratic president even more, ISI had a comeback for that argument. It said Sen. McCain's bipartisan instincts made it more likely he could turn his ideas into law as a Republican president working with what will probably remain a Democratic-majority Congress. 
With Sen. McCain's victories in delegate-rich states from New York to California on "Super Tuesday," more Republicans are adjusting to the idea of the party maverick turning into the party standard-bearer. Their attitude adjustments recall the saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." If, as recent polls show, Sen. McCain is the one Republican who could beat the Democratic nominee, especially if the nominee is Hillary Clinton, then he's their man. 
Of the 21 states with Republican primaries or caucuses Tuesday, Sen. McCain won nine. They included the biggest ones, with the most nominating-convention delegates. Still, that meant a majority of the states choosing a nominee preferred either former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Mr. Huckabee swept Southern and border-South states, reflecting the former Baptist preacher's strength among fellow evangelical conservatives. A Republican nominee must win those states in November to have any hope of election. 
Mr. Huckabee was boosted by his better-than-expected showing, but still hasn't shown an ability to expand support much beyond his base. As for Mr. Romney, his candidacy is looking less viable. On Tuesday, he won only in states where he has roots -- Massachusetts and Utah -- and in several small states that held caucuses rather than primaries, where he invested his personal wealth to fund organizations to get out the vote. 
A big test of Sen. McCain's outreach to the Republican Party base comes today, when he will speak to the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual Washington gathering of the right's leading activists, theorists and politicians. Last year Sen. McCain skipped the conference while other Republican candidates came courting, reflecting his campaign's fear that the conservatives would give him a hostile reception. Many conservatives took it as a snub. 
Now, with the nomination in sight, the McCain campaign is showing up -- but not exactly bending to hard-core conservatives. "There are some specific issues they consider constitutional issues -- like campaign finance [limits] -- that they just disagree with Sen. McCain," senior adviser Charlie Black said yesterday aboard the McCain campaign plane. But, he added, "When they understand, 'OK, there's nothing else we can do; it's McCain versus Clinton or Obama,' the huge difference will cause them to support McCain." 
It's not always an easy sell. CPAC's chairman, veteran conservative activist David Keene, recently endorsed Mr. Romney. And yesterday morning, radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh continued to lead the post-Super Tuesday lamentations of conservative broadcasters about a McCain nomination. The senator can surely work with Democrats -­because he's one of them, Mr. Limbaugh said. 
While Sen. McCain's well-publicized battles with industry lobbyists are unusual for a Republican lawmaker, they also endear him to voters disgusted by the clout of special interests in Washington -- a sentiment that runs strong in this election year. That national reputation also meant Mr. Romney fell flat in his attempts to tar the senator as a Washington insider. Sen. McCain "is not well-beloved by the lobbying world, to say the least, and he's used that to his advantage," says John Feehery, a former adviser to Republican congressional leaders. 
When Sen. McCain's presidential campaign began taking wing in late 2006, his run-ins with Washington establishment types were a hindrance, not a help. 
Current and former associates say Rick Davis, then a top adviser and now campaign manager, assured the senator, who loathes fund raising, that he wouldn't need to solicit many donations on the phone or attend endless fund-raisers. Instead, money would flow from the Internet. It didn't, in part because of Sen. McCain's unpopular stands for the Iraq war and for giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. Many deep-pocketed, business-oriented Republicans kept their wallets closed. 
Executives and employees from the politically active tobacco industry gave Sen. McCain's presidential campaign just $10,700 last year -- about one-tenth of what former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got, and well below the totals of Sens. Clinton and Obama. 
The once front-running campaign ran deep into debt last summer, provoking a staff shake-up and layoffs. Pundits wrote Sen. McCain's political obituary. But the senator, more comfortable as an insurgent than a front-runner anyway, fought back on a shoestring budget. After his third and biggest primary victory in Florida last month, he held fund-raisers in every big city he visited in the frenetic week of campaigning coast-to-coast for Super Tuesday -- knowing donors would want to get on the apparent winner's bandwagon. 
Aside from money, the other factor that nearly derailed Sen. McCain's candidacy last year was his support, with liberal Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, for President Bush's proposal to give the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. a way to earn citizenship. That idea became hugely unpopular among many Republican conservatives, and the bill died in Congress. On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidates ratcheted up their anti-immigration rhetoric. Mr. Romney regularly chided his rival for "the McCain-Kennedy bill." 
But if the issue almost cost Sen. McCain his party's nomination, as a nominee his position could help Republicans win a chunk of the fast- growing Latino vote. Many Hispanic voters are aware of Sen. McCain's repeated comments in Republican debates and town-hall meetings that illegal immigrants "are God's children, as well." 
"If McCain is the Republican nominee, the Hispanic vote could come right back to where it was with Bush," says Lionel Sosa, the media strategist who helped Mr. Bush capture 40% of the group's vote in 2004. "He's the only candidate who's been on the right side of the immigration issue from the beginning." 
Democrats are likely to argue that Sen. McCain tried to have it both ways on immigration by toughening his rhetoric during the campaign. At a debate among Republican candidates in California last week, he refused to say if he'd vote for his own bill now. And in a radio advertisement that aired in California ahead of Super Tuesday, Sen. McCain stressed his new respect for the view that America's borders should be secured before considering expanded rights for illegal immigrants. 
"I've listened and learned," Sen. McCain said in the ad. "No one will be rewarded for illegal behavior. They'll go to the back of the line, pay fines and learn English." 
Sen. McCain's bipartisan work on climate-change legislation also isn't popular with many conservative Republicans, as Mr. Romney knew when he charged that such a law would lead to higher utility and gasoline costs for consumers. But McCain advisers insist that the senator's stand will prove popular in a general election among younger voters and suburbanites. 
"I am very glad that we will have a nominee . . . who will talk about global climate change in a way that resonates with the country," said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, traveling with the McCain campaign yesterday.

The crippling blow dealt this week to FutureGen, the U.S. government's marquee effort to develop a "clean coal" power plant, will make it harder for the utility sector to slash carbon-dioxide emissions and keep coal in the mix over time as a cheap electricity source. It could also help push the nation toward greater reliance on nuclear power. 
On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said the Bush administration was yanking its support for the project, whose price tag had ballooned to $1.8 billion, nearly double original estimates. Energy Department officials said it was time to confront the cost issue, before equipment was ordered. Clay Sell, deputy energy secretary, said the easier, less-responsible path would have been to pretend everything was fine "and then when the thing went south, I could have blamed the next administration for failing to bring this good idea to fruition." 
Members of the FutureGen alliance, consisting of a dozen or so coal companies and utilities from around the world, said they will take their case directly to Congress. "This is not the end game," said Michael Morris, chief executive of American Electric Power Co., a leading member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance. "Clean coal is essential." 
The plant "was to have been the prototype for the next generation of clean-coal plants around the world," said Scott Smith, AEP's representative on the FutureGen board. Its technology would have been shared with consortium members, including China's largest coal-burning utility, China Huaneng Group, which has been criticized for its CO2 emissions. China, the biggest coal-consuming nation alongside the U.S., has been criticized for its massive increase in carbon dioxide emissions. 
States competed vigorously for the privilege of hosting the plant, which would have turned coal into hydrogen-rich synthetic gas for generating electricity while pumping CO2 underground for permanent storage. A federal site in Mattoon, Ill., won the contest, edging out another site in Illinois and two in Texas. 
FutureGen board members said they'd been in discussion with the Department of Energy about ways to restructure the deal. The board offered to split the cost of any overruns, a burden that otherwise would have fallen squarely on the federal government. Under the original terms, a nonprofit industry consortium was to bear about $400 million of costs. 
The industry is now left to consider how it will both increase its ability to generate electricity while at the same time create power that does less damage to the environment. Experts say it's critical for the U.S. to find ways to use coal that don't result in massive releases of CO2. Coal is America's most plentiful domestic fossil fuel. About 90% of domestic production feeds utilities, making the mining industry dependent on finding a solution, too. 
Currently, the U.S. gets more than half its electricity from coal- fired plants and its dependence has grown greater, in recent years, due to coal's ability to compete effectively with costlier electricity from natural gas-fired plants. But the emissions are regarded as a significant factor in rising carbon levels that contribute to climate change. Experts say there is no way the U.S. will be able to meet a targeted 80% reduction in CO2 levels below 1990 levels by 2050 -- the goal of major legislation favored by several presidential aspirants -- unless it develops benign ways to burn coal. 
Last year, plans for more than 50 conventional coal-fired plants were canceled or delayed due to concerns about the environmental impact or through fear that carbon legislation is coming that could make their output uneconomic. The federal government has repeatedly held out the promise that technologies would be developed to clean up coal. 
"People don't understand the magnitude of the problem," said Howard Herzog, principal research engineer for M.I.T.'s Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program. "How can we do hundreds of these plants by 2050 -- and that's what we'll need -- if we can't even do one?" 
If progress on clean-coal technology isn't made soon, AEP's Mr. Morris said, "we'll have to move nuclear up the ladder." Indeed, the nuclear-power industry is already experiencing an unlikely rebirth in part because it is seen as a cleaner alternative to other electricity sources. 
To date, five utilities have submitted applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to build nuclear plants, adding to the 104 already in operation. But nobody expects them to be cheap and cost estimates already have caused two companies to pull back, Scana Corp. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s MidAmerican Energy Holdings. 
If nuclear power also stumbles due to cost concerns, the nation could face supply shortages in coming years unlike anything seen in the past.

Abstract 
Under the project, called FutureGen Industrial Alliance Inc., the government was to support the construction of a nearly pollution-free coal plant that would have turned coal into hydrogen-rich synthetic gas for generating electricity while pumping carbon dioxide underground for permanent storage. 

Full Text 
The Bush administration, in a major policy reversal, canceled its support for a planned $1.8 billion coal-gasification plant that was supposed to herald a new era of emissions-free power but instead has been plagued by huge cost overruns. 
The move may kill the project by shifting most of the cost to an industry consortium whose exposure was expected to be capped at $400 million. 
The decision by the Department of Energy represents a blow to coal producers and coal-burning utilities which had hoped to use the demonstration plant to test "clean-coal" technologies. The Bush administration had promoted the project as part of a broader effort to keep coal as part of the nation's fuel mix by finding ways to burn it more cleanly and store carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Under the project, called FutureGen Industrial Alliance Inc., the government was to support the construction of a nearly pollution-free coal plant that would have turned coal into hydrogen-rich synthetic gas for generating electricity while pumping carbon dioxide underground for permanent storage. Carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel combustion is a primary greenhouse gas linked to global warming. 
In recent years, however, the project's estimated cost has roughly doubled from an original level of $950 million, driven partly by rising prices for certain materials like steel and equipment and by higher-than-anticipated labor costs. 
Some industry observers felt the eventual cost could have exceeded $2 billion, which would have made it one of the most costly power plants ever constructed, given its modest, 275-megawatt size. One megawatt can power 500 to 1,000 homes. In a conference call yesterday, Clay Sell, deputy secretary of the DOE, said department officials concluded that the project's costs were likely to rise even more. 
The agency, which was supposed to pay for most of FutureGen's costs, had begun to express misgivings about the overruns in recent months. But as recently as Tuesday, Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman had deflected questions from reporters on whether the administration would continue funding the project. 
Instead of continuing with the single plant, DOE officials said they would fund a few smaller projects across the U.S. in an effort to illustrate how carbon dioxide from commercial power plants can be safely captured and stored. 
"This restructuring . . . is an all-around better deal for Americans," Mr. Bodman said in making the announcement. 
Michael Mudd, chief executive of FutureGen, said the announcement caught him and consortium members by surprise. "We are still trying to sort things out," he said. "FutureGen is too important not to continue." Two consortium members, Southern Co. and American Electric Power Co., expressed disappointment. "FutureGen was critically important for future energy and climate stability," said AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry. "We'll be talking with the other members of the alliance to determine next steps." 
The plant wasn't expected to be a commercial success, but was supposed to provide valuable experience in integrating different technologies into a single plant capable of neutralizing coal's emissions problems. Illinois, a big coal-producing and burning state, won the competition among several states to provide a site for the plant. 
The DOE's announcement marks the latest instance in which it has changed course after launching a program to revolutionize an energy- intensive segment of the economy. More than a decade ago, the agency launched the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a research program that sought to spur development of an 80-miles-a-gallon diesel-and-electric hybrid car. The program failed. 
Meanwhile, Japanese auto makers, who were barred from the U.S.- sponsored program, beat Detroit to the showroom with gasoline-and- electric hybrid cars. The diesel-hybrid effort was replaced with another federal clean-car program intended to spur hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars. 
Critics accused the Bush administration of seeking to avoid having to invest big new sums of money in the deployment of clean-coal technology, while at the same time resisting other measures -- such as binding caps on carbon emissions -- that they say could deliver more immediate results. 
"It is really hard to see it as anything other than bait-and-switch by the administration," said David Hawkins, director of the climate center at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Abstract 
The Republican candidates see energy security mostly as a supply- side challenge that can be solved by increasing oil and gas drilling, building nuclear power plants, developing so-called clean-coal technologies and helping innovators find technological fixes. 

Full Text 
The narrowed field of presidential candidates increases the likelihood that the winner will favor stepped-up efforts to fight global warming and change how the nation uses energy. 
The leading contenders -- Sen. John McCain on the Republican side and Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for the Democrats -- support legislation that would gradually cut greenhouse-gas emissions, a sharp departure from the Bush administration's approach. 
But key differences remain between the parties. And while another Republican -- former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- supports emissions cuts, Republican former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is pushing more-modest measures. 
The Republican candidates see energy security mostly as a supply- side challenge that can be solved by increasing oil and gas drilling, building nuclear power plants, developing so-called clean-coal technologies and helping innovators find technological fixes. Many worry about the cost and effectiveness of emissions-control efforts. Most favor drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Among Republicans, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, sees the greatest role for government. 
Democrats focus more on the demand side. They see a central role for the government to put in place programs to cut oil, natural-gas and electricity use and bolster renewable energy. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama both believe government should set mandatory targets to reduce corporate greenhouse-gas emissions, then allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute, creating what is known as a cap-and-trade system. 
Among Republicans, Mr. McCain is the most outspoken on the issue. In 2003 he broke with many in his party to sponsor greenhouse-gas legislation with Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, now an independent but at the time a Democrat; the legislation was unsuccessful. Mr. McCain hasn't co-sponsored more-recent efforts. His 2003 proposal -­which would have resulted in free emissions credits to big polluters like utilities -- was less stringent than the system currently supported by Sens. Clinton and Obama, one that called for auctioning the credits. 
Mr. McCain warned in a recent speech that "unless we reverse what is happening on this planet, my dear friends, we are going to hand our children a planet that is badly damaged." 
Mr. Romney has issued few specifics on energy, although he has said he favors opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and accelerating construction of nuclear power plants. 
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have supported legislation calling for greenhouse-gas emissions to be reduced to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. They want clean-energy funds to quicken the deployment of advanced technologies. They would train people for so-called green- collar jobs and would recruit youth to weatherize homes in poor neighborhoods. Mrs. Clinton's goal is five million new clean-energy jobs. 
Mr. Obama, in a speech in October, said the U.S. needs to make climate change a priority. "Washington hasn't acted, and that is the reason America hasn't led," he said. 
Mrs. Clinton, of New York, has expressed skepticism about efforts to convert coal into a liquid fuel. Mr. Obama, from coal-rich Illinois, supports the idea. Mr. Romney expresses support for coal-to-liquids programs because coal is plentiful in the U.S.

Abstract 
Carbon sequestration, the removal and storage of carbon dioxide, a gas tied to global warming, is gaining more attention in China because of the country's vast coal reserves, aging oil fields and new coal- fired power stations. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- China is expected to produce more greenhouse gas than any other country over the next 20 years, but Beijing is working to develop technology that can capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. 
These efforts are creating investment opportunities for foreign companies as the more common paths into China's energy sector are being closed and reserved for state enterprises. 
Carbon sequestration, the removal and storage of carbon dioxide, a gas tied to global warming, is gaining more attention in China because of the country's vast coal reserves, aging oil fields and new coal- fired power stations. Burning fossil fuels such as coal produces carbon dioxide. 
The U.S. and other countries are trying to develop power plants that trap carbon dioxide and stick it underground, perhaps to help recovery in aging oil fields or to use in other industrial contexts. 
Carbon sequestration is still in the early phases of development, but there is increasing interest, despite the technical challenges. 
The latest reminder came Friday, when energy companies from Hong Kong and Canada said they would work with China's leading producer of natural gas from coal mines. 
Hong Kong-listed Enviro Energy International Holdings Ltd. and Canada's Petromin Resources Ltd. signed a deal with China United Coalbed Methane Corp. for a five-year project in the coal-rich province of Shanxi in northern China. 
Supported in part by funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, the 10 million yuan ($1.39 million) project will involve drilling wells in a coal bed that is about 3,300 feet below the surface and unsuitable for commercial mining. Canada's Alberta Research Council will provide technical expertise. 
"The ultimate target for this project is to try to capture CO2 from power plants and chemical plants and then inject this C02 into the deep coal [bed] and also to enhance coal-bed methane production," said Sun Maoyuan, chairman of China United Coalbed Methane. 
China wants to increase the use of methane, the explosive gas that has caused scores of deadly accidents in China's coal mines. Typically, methane is just burned off, releasing more greenhouse gases, but it can be captured and used to power turbines in power plants. 
China wants the methane from coal beds to supplement natural-gas supplies. Two-thirds of China's energy needs are met by coal, which produces around three times more carbon dioxide than gas-power generators. A typical 500-megawatt power station emits more than 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide a day. 
Rising electricity demand has forced China to add more than 90 gigawatts of power-generating capacity in each of the past two years. That is equivalent to the combined generating capacity of the United Kingdom and France in 2006-07. 
A $9 million test project at the nearby South Qinshui Basin in Shanxi province, involving the Alberta Research Council, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and China United Coalbed Methane, showed that methane rates nearly double when carbon dioxide is injected into the coal bed. 
Kenny Chan, chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong's Enviro Energy, said the latest project is long term and faces a number of technical challenges. It would need to earn carbon credits to make the economics work, underscoring that carbon-capture and carbon-storage projects aren't eligible for the emissions-trading plan set up under the Kyoto Protocol.

Abstract 
Last year, the U.S. and key developing countries helped forge a global, legally-binding agreement to accelerate the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol, reducing greenhouse gases by at least 3 billion metric tons, and probably meeting or exceeding what the Kyoto Protocol might achieve by 2012. 

Full Text 
The "Bali Roadmap" is a major achievement. It was adopted by all parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to guide negotiation of a new, post-2012 climate-change arrangement by 2009. The U.S. is committed to working with other nations to agree on a global outcome that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable. That is the only kind of agreement that can win public support. 
To be environmentally effective, a new approach must involve measurable actions by the world's largest producers of greenhouse-gas emissions. Without substantial participation by developing economies, greenhouse-gas emissions will continue to rise rapidly over the next 50 years even if the U.S. and other developed economies cut emissions to zero. 
To be economically sustainable, our actions must uphold the hopes of people everywhere for economic growth, energy security and improved quality of life. Lowering the cost of emissions reductions requires speeding up the development and deployment of technologies that will fundamentally improve the way we produce and consume energy. This includes the capture and storage of carbon emitted from coal-power plants. 
In May, President Bush announced the U.S. would work closely with other major economies to contribute to a new global arrangement under the UNFCCC. This initiative has received support from G8 and Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders and the U.N. Secretary-General. The U.S. hosted the first meeting in late September, bringing together 17 major economies. These countries account for more than 80% of the world's economic output, energy use, and greenhouse-gas emissions. 
The major economies plan to meet again at the end of January to discuss a work program that contributes to the Bali Roadmap. Such a program should include discussion of a long-term, global emissions- reduction goal as well as national plans with mid-term goals -- backed by a nationally appropriate mix of regulations, incentives and public- private partnerships. It would also include cooperative technology strategies and other actions in key sectors, especially fossil-power generation, personal transportation and sustainable forest management. 
The program should cover innovative financing mechanisms and the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers for clean energy goods and services, improved emissions-accounting systems, and ways to help countries adapt to climate change and gain access to technology. It would be useful to discuss how to structure a post-2012 arrangement that would incorporate positive, not punitive, ways to ensure accountability and encourage participation by all major economies -- developed and developing alike. We hope these discussions can produce tangible outcomes that can be endorsed at a major economies leaders meeting later this year. 
The U.S. is already working on significant new global and national actions to combat emissions. Last year, the U.S. and key developing countries helped forge a global, legally-binding agreement to accelerate the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol, reducing greenhouse gases by at least 3 billion metric tons, and probably meeting or exceeding what the Kyoto Protocol might achieve by 2012. 
At home, President Bush recently signed energy legislation that mandates substantial, mid-term requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency (40% improvement), renewable fuels (36 billion gallons annually), and efficiency of appliances, lighting systems, and government operations. This law will produce some of the largest emission cuts in our nation's history. Early estimates suggest more than 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases will be avoided through 2030. 
The U.S. and EU have jointly proposed in the WTO to rapidly eliminate the tariff and non-tariff trade barriers that impede investment in clean technologies and services. This would lower the cost of cutting emissions and increase clean technology trade by up to 14% a year. Along with Japan, the U.S. will continue its massive investment -- nearly $18 billion since 2001 -- in researching, developing and deploying cleaner, more efficient technologies, and finding ways to share this technology with other nations. We are working with key donors on a new multilateral fund to accelerate the use of cleaner, lower-carbon technologies and infrastructure. 
Deforestation accounts for roughly 20% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, so the U.S. is enhancing its efforts to conserve and expand the world's forests. The U.S. is also working on monitoring and adaptation tools, such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, a 72-nation collaboration that can help fragile communities prepare for the effects of climate change. 
With the major economies and through the U.N. negotiations, the U.S. is striving for a successful climate-change arrangement that will attract broad international support. As Mr. Bush put it: "We've identified a problem, let's go solve it together." 
Mr. Connaughton is chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Mr. Price is assistant to the president and deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs.

Abstract 
Peabody says that if the GreatPoint Technology proves viable on a large scale, it foresees supplying coal to a gasification plant in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, where it has mines and vast reserves located near gas pipelines to Chicago and the Midwest. 

Full Text 
U.S. coal giant Peabody Energy Co. has bought a stake in GreatPoint Energy Inc., a Massachusetts start-up company that is among several ventures exploring technology that can turn coal into natural gas. 
GreatPoint, which has attracted $140 million in start-up funding, says it can turn coal into gas in an environmentally friendly process at $4 per thousand cubic feet, about 40% below current prices for natural gas. Peabody says that if the GreatPoint Technology proves viable on a large scale, it foresees supplying coal to a gasification plant in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, where it has mines and vast reserves located near gas pipelines to Chicago and the Midwest. 
Peabody and Cambridge, Mass.-based GreatPoint declined to say how much Peabody had invested. 
The investment marks rising interest in coal gasification technology, which is intended to supply coal-based fuel without emitting the same amount of global-warming gases as when coal is burned. 
Such projects could also supply gas in a time of growing demand for the cleaner-burning fuel. General Electric Co. and others have invested in coal-gasification technology, which is often eligible for government subsidies. 
Coal gasification faces significant hurdles, and GreatPoint's technology has yet to prove viable on a large basis.

Abstract 
Europe's ski resorts have been racing to install snow-making machines to bed the slopes with artificial snow as snowfall becomes less reliable and resorts compete with one another to offer guaranteed good skiing. 

Full text 
DAVOS, Switzerland -- The chief executives of Coca-Cola Co., Nestle SA and others will warn the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that the world is running out of water, threatening conflict, higher prices and lost production. 
Some will likely then strap on skis to take advantage of the Swiss resort's glistening slopes. But the pistes of the Alps are also contributing to the world's water woes. 
Europe's ski resorts have been racing to install snow-making machines to bed the slopes with artificial snow as snowfall becomes less reliable and resorts compete with one another to offer guaranteed good skiing. That is great for skiers and businesses that rely on them, but not so great for local water supplies. 
Snow cannons suck up a lot of water. As much as 35% of all water used in Davos now goes to making artificial snow, according to a report released last month by the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research to examine the net benefits of snow-making machines. Davos bought 16 additional snow cannons for this season, according to town authorities. 
Should Davos-man feel guilty about going skiing? "Well, yes," said Christian Rixen, a Davos-based biologist who cowrote the report. He added that skiers should add to the area's development by coming in summer, too. 
Swiss ski resorts, which tend to be at higher elevations and have reliable snow cover, still have relatively few snow cannons, covering around 19% of all slopes. That compares with 50% coverage in Austria and 100% in some Italian ski areas. Across the Alps, snow-making machines now suck up nearly as much water as Vienna, a city of 1.7 million people, says Josef Essl, in charge of land-use planning and nature conservation at the Innsbruck-based Austrian Alpine Association. 
In dry years, some Alpine villages have to get their water from fire trucks because mountain reservoirs are dry, says Mr. Essl. Though a growing problem for the Alps, snow cannons are a localized and minor issue in the bigger picture of water shortage, experts say. 
Davos organizers say this is the first year they have managed to get member companies interested in battling future water shortages, because they have recognized the problem as a potential threat to prices, production and economic growth, as well as a cause of human suffering. Coca-Cola, Nestle, PepsiCo Inc., British brewer SABMiller PLC and Dow Chemical Co. are among corporations that signed up to an appeal planned for release at this year's forum aimed at driving up water productivity. 
Based on current usage patterns, about 30 countries will be short of water by 2025, according to the Sri Lanka-based International Water Management Institute, a nonprofit supported by 60 governments. That is mainly because most irrigation for agriculture is inefficient, while demand for meat, wheat and other high-protein foods that require a lot of water is growing rapidly as people in China and India become wealthier and more urban. 
But the battle against climate change is sucking up water, too, creating what analysts in the field call an accelerator effect. Take biofuels, produced to cut use of fossil fuels such as gasoline that spew the carbon dioxide that causes global warming. Biofuels are mostly made from crops that have to be grown, which puts pressure on land and food prices, as well as on water resources. It takes on average 1,000 liters (260 gallons) of water to make one liter of ethanol-based biofuel, according to the IWMI. For gasoline, it takes 
2.5 liters. 
The same goes for some of the alternatives to coal-fired power plants that produce less carbon dioxide. Hydroelectric power requires large quantities of water. So do the cooling systems in nuclear-power plants. Clean-coal technologies, too, use more water than regular coal. Overall, industry accounts for around 23% of global fresh water use, compared with around 70% for agriculture and 7% for residential use. Demand is rising in all three areas. 
"Some people call water the oil of the 21st century. Whether you like that description or not, one thing is clear, availability of water will be a key driver in the development of the world's economy and government policies in the next decade," said Andrew N. Liveris, chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, in a statement. 
The Alps face a problem as snow coverage falls. Last year was so warm that organizers at the World Cup downhill races at Wengen, Switzerland, added fertilizer to the snow to slow its melting. This year, the snow in the Alps is good -- but the snow cannons still pump out artificial snow at much the same rate, padding the slopes just in case there is a thaw. 
Snow cannons take water, supercool it and spray it out over the ski runs. You need to build pipes up the mountainsides to bring water to cement storage tanks, and pipes to take it to the snow cannons. 
Scientists predict that lower resorts will have to be abandoned by 2030 anyhow, as rising temperatures lift the snowline and make it harder for snow machines to operate. The skiers will leave, but not the pipes and cement. 
Some resorts use water laced with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacteria produced as Snowmax by Denver-based York Snow Inc. Snowmax enables water to crystallize into snow at higher temperatures, by acting as an agent for the crystals to form around. 
For towns such as Davos that rely on tourism for 40% of their annual income, snow cannons are attractive. According to Mr. Rixen's report, artificial snow can secure an estimated 10% of the local community's income in winters that provide low snow coverage. From a near standing start in 1990, snow cannons are spreading across the Alps "and there's no end in sight," says Mr. Rixen. Davos is unlikely to have to abandon ski runs or suffer water shortage -- unlike Scuol, another Swiss resort the study looked at, says Mr. Rixen. The ski slopes at Davos are relatively high and the town has a large reservoir nearby from which to pump the extra water needed. 
Corrections & Amplifications 
York Snow Inc.'s Snowmax, a product added to water that aids in the making of artificial snow, is a protein derived from a bacteria. An article Wednesday on artificial snow making in Davos, Switzerland, incorrectly said the product was a bacteria. Also, a table accompanying the article giving examples of water use failed to include some qualifiers and converted several numbers incorrectly.

Abstract 
Charging utilities for all their emission permits could make coal costlier than natural gas, "and this would have an effect on investment planning for new power stations," says Julia Scharlemann, an RWE spokeswoman. 

Full Text 
Europe is proposing hitting industry with tougher caps on greenhouse-gas emissions, intensifying talk of a global environmental trade fight. 
Proposals expected to be unveiled today would tighten caps first imposed three years ago. A big change is that European governments would start charging companies for pollution permits that so far they have handed out mostly free. Analysts say the proposals would significantly raise the cost of coal-fired electricity. 
Representatives of some big industries say higher regulatory costs might spur them to shift production to countries that haven't imposed limits, particularly in the developing world. 
If the proposals are adopted -- which is far from clear -- they wouldn't take effect until 2013, and even then European industry is likely to fight them unless the world's other major emitters, notably the U.S. and China, put constraints on their industries too. The U.S. and China so far have declined to mandate emission cuts. 
Indeed, the latest crackdown is raising the specter of a trade war over global warming. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has suggested Europe consider tariffs on energy-intensive products imported from countries that don't impose greenhouse-gas limits. 
Similar bursts of carbon protectionism are bubbling up in Washington, where U.S. industry increasingly expects Congress to cap U.S. emissions in the next several years. One pending proposal, supported by a coalition of companies, unions and environmental groups, would require exporters of certain goods to the U.S. that don't reduce their emissions to buy environmental dispensations from the U.S. government. The idea is that those dispensations would raise the exporters' costs to match those of competing U.S. firms. 
The Kyoto Protocol, the climate-change treaty, requires emission cuts only from industrialized countries that have ratified it. While members of the European Union have ratified Kyoto, the U.S. never did, arguing it would severely crimp the U.S. economy. China, a developing country, isn't subject to caps under the treaty, set to expire in 2012. 
Under the Kyoto system, governments in the European Union give companies within their borders emission permits letting them send a certain amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Companies that need more permits must buy them from companies that have extras, creating a "carbon market." 
European Commission officials say their new carbon proposals assume a truly global agreement would be in place by the time their new rules take effect in 2013. If not, "then we have options," says Barbara Helfferich, a commission spokeswoman. One, similar to the proposal pending in Washington, would be to require that competing industries in countries without caps meet emission-reduction targets for goods they export into Europe. That could force them to buy emission credits on the European market -- thus boosting their costs. 
The proposals would need to be approved by a body of representatives of EU member countries. Among the expected proposals: that electricity producers pay for all their emission permits starting in 2013, and that more globally competitive manufacturers pay for all their permits by 2020. 
Among the companies hardest hit would be RWE AG, the German utility that makes most of its power from coal. Per Lekander, an analyst at UBS in London, estimates having to buy carbon permits could reduce RWE's earnings in 2013 by an amount equal to more than half its forecast 2008 earnings. 
Charging utilities for all their emission permits could make coal costlier than natural gas, "and this would have an effect on investment planning for new power stations," says Julia Scharlemann, an RWE spokeswoman. 
Heavy manufacturers also are fuming. Requiring manufacturers to pay for emissions permits they are now getting free "is absolutely unacceptable if other producers in other countries have no such obligation," says Markus Weber, manager of emissions trading for ThyssenKrupp AG, the big German-based steelmaker. 
But imposing tariffs on imports from countries like China would be fraught with practical problems, he says, including determining how to levy the tariff on a finished product like a car, whose parts are built in multiple countries. "You have the huge potential of massive trade conflicts," he adds.

Full Text 
Multinational companies are participating in a new U.S.-government program that aims to help factories in China reduce carbon emissions while it generates business for American and other environmental- services companies. 
The idea is to arrange for Chinese businesses that have limited knowledge of environmental technologies essentially to outsource their cleaning and greening. The program known as P2E2 -- which stands for pollution prevention and energy efficiency -- aims to connect the factories with capital and expertise to help them upgrade equipment and cut their emissions and energy use. 
The multinational companies backing the program, including footwear maker Adidas AG, are looking at ways to encourage their suppliers to participate, while P2E2 approaches other companies. 
China is poised to pass the U.S. as the world's largest carbon emitter. Chinese factories, which churn out shoes, electronics and other goods for the world, typically get energy from heavily polluting coal-fired power plants. Curbing emissions from China's factories has become a growing focus of the global battle against climate change and the emission of heat-trapping gases that contribute to it. 
The U.S. government essentially plays the role of matchmaker, helping factories connect with money and services. At a recent forum on P2E2 in Hong Kong, U.S. companies met potential partners. 
P2E2 is based on an unconventional financing program. Banks and equity investors provide the funding and loans to environmental- and energy-services companies, as they are called, which have the expertise and technology to help factories increase energy efficiency. 
The International Finance Corp., part of the World Bank, will provide guarantees to banks that make loans for P2E2 projects in Asia. ABP Investments of the Netherlands, one of the world's largest pension funds, says P2E2 projects will be eligible for funding under a program it has to support investments in innovation. 
The environmental-services companies then strike deals with the Chinese factories, offering to upgrade their equipment free of charge. The factories will give back to the environmental-services companies over time by handing them a cut -- to be agreed by the two parties -- of the savings the plants achieve on energy costs. According to the plans, the environmental-services companies will use the money to repay the bank loans and provide a return to investors who provided equity. 
"If you're running a plastics plant, your core business is not saving on pollution," said Stewart Ballard, chief commercial consul for the U.S. Commercial Service at the American Consulate General in Hong Kong. 
There are questions about whether Chinese factories will be interested in participating, as they would have to hand over the savings from the new technology to an environmental-services company. 
"It's going to take quite a bit more time . . . we have to overcome management resistance," says Lyn Ip, Adidas's manager for environmental affairs in Asia. But pressure from multinational companies the factories supply could encourage participation, she said. "Obviously, we don't mandate; we don't say, 'You must follow this particular program.'" 
The program's initial focus will be factories in China, but it is open to participants throughout Asia and elsewhere -- though all parties must have a legal presence in Hong Kong. That stipulation helped gain the support of the Chinese government, which bears no cost for the program. Hong Kong is governed separately from China and has more transparent legal and financial systems, which P2E2 will use. 
U.S. Commerce Department officials hope the program will help generate markets for U.S. clean-tech companies in Asia. Assistant Commerce Secretary David Bohigian is leading a trade mission of more than a dozen U.S. companies, including Caterpillar Inc. and investment firm Marisco Capital Management, to China and India. 
"The opportunities are unparalleled in terms of the amount of money that's going to go into the energy infrastructure over the next 25 years," Mr. Bohigian said. He estimates there will be about $1 trillion in annual spending on energy infrastructure through 2025. 
Support for equity investors will be available through the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, also part of the World Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a 
U.S. government body. 
"We're hoping that P2E2 will be the spark that's needed to ignite an avalanche of change," said Michael Friedlander, chief operating officer and chief financial officer for ABP's Hong Kong-based subsidiary, ABP Investments Asia Ltd. 
Adidas is promoting the P2E2 program throughout its global supply chain of more than 1,000 manufacturers, including 307 factories in China. 
"It's very crucial for us to try and illustrate the economic potential for the industry and . . . the tangible benefits for the environment," Ms. Ip said. "If it doesn't make economic sense, then it will be difficult to do any change." 
Adidas also is looking to join with other companies, within and outside the sportswear industry, to push awareness of P2E2, she said.

Abstract 
Both countries are fending off international efforts to limit their emissions of global-warming gases such as carbon dioxide, which is released from coal-burning power plants and cement factories -- pillars of their economic booms and urbanization drives. 

Full Text 
BEIJING -- India's prime minister called for cooperation with China in developing nuclear power, as the quest for energy and the fight to avert environmental sanctions bring the longtime rivals closer together. 
"We can do much more to jointly develop clean and energy-efficient technologies through collaborating" on research and development, Indian Premier Manmohan Singh said in a speech on the third day of a trip to Beijing, according to Reuters. 
Mr. Singh's trip is the first by an Indian prime minister to China in five years. It comes as the neighbors have begun expanding trade and other ties despite decades of hostility and a burgeoning economic rivalry that spans the oil fields of central Asia and the nascent consumer markets of Africa. 
The historical tensions between the two include a 1962 war -- a conflict that is still raw for India and that has spawned continuing disagreements over the border. Continuing suspicion of China has prompted India's government to withhold investment approvals for some Chinese companies. 
The two sides achieved no breakthroughs this week, but they pledged to continue rapid expansion of already rising commercial exchanges. 
Bilateral trade between China and India surged to $39 billion last year from $2 billion in 1999. This week, Mr. Singh and his Chinese counterparts pledged to boost that to $60 billion by 2010. 
Trade growth has been driven by booming economic expansions that are also creating huge new demand for energy in China and India. In response, both countries have been accelerating their drive to develop nuclear power and other alternative fuels. China still overwhelmingly relies on coal, but it has plans to build about two nuclear power plants a year for the next 15 years -- the world's biggest nuclear- power building boom in decades. 
To Beijing's displeasure, India last year signed a deal that for the first time in three decades allows the U.S. to ship nuclear fuel and technology to India. Mr. Singh's comments appear meant in part to allay Beijing's worries over nuclear proliferation. 
India and China have found common ground on other environmental issues. Both countries are fending off international efforts to limit their emissions of global-warming gases such as carbon dioxide, which is released from coal-burning power plants and cement factories -- pillars of their economic booms and urbanization drives. Curbing these gases limits economic growth, they argue, and doesn't account for the damage already done by industrialized nations. 
"The rights of our people to a fair chance to improve their lot cannot be abandoned because of environmental damage caused by others who . . . squandered the earth's resources," Mr. Singh was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. 
China, the world's biggest coal producer and consumer, has already surpassed the U.S. as the world's top emitter of greenhouse gas by some estimates. India, which has the world's fourth-biggest coal reserves and has ambitious plans to use even more, isn't far behind. 
While closer cooperation between China and India to develop sources of energy such as nuclear power could help take pressure off overburdened global fuel supplies, their allegiance to countering limits on greenhouse gases could hurt the world environment. 
Despite the size of their economies, bilateral trade between China and India remains a fraction of their total trade with other countries. China's trade last year with Singapore, a country of four million people, hit $47 billion, some 20% more than the value of Sino- Indian trade, according to China's Commerce Ministry. 
India exports mostly low-value-added commodities to China, including iron ore and semifinished iron and steel. In turn, China's major exports to India have been electronic goods, coal and coke. Because these commodities are more highly valued, bilateral trade has tilted more in favor of China, which posted a roughly $10 billion surplus last year. 
The two countries have talked about signing a free-trade agreement, but China has appeared more eager than India to get it sealed. India has been concerned that it has more to lose from such an agreement. India's economy is protected by high tariff rates, which on average are about 10 percentage points higher than the tax levied on most Chinese goods. India would have to get rid of these tariffs -- and lose the tax revenue its government could otherwise collect -- under a free-trade agreement. 
Indian officials also worry that a flood of Chinese goods would threaten its own low-cost manufacturing base. China, in turn, complains of barriers to direct investments in India. 
The free-trade agreement apparently didn't come up during official talks, a sign that more delays are to be expected in getting it finalized. During his trip, Mr. Singh said greater economic integration can happen only when both sides help create a "level playing field."

Four years ago, it was almost impossible to get financial institutions to attend an investor summit on climate risk. Today, some of the world's largest banks have embraced the issue by focusing on research on the impact of global warming on investments, cutting their own greenhouse emissions and funding clean-energy projects, according to a report released last week by Ceres, a coalition of investors, environmental groups and other public-interest organizations. 
However, a six-month study of the world's 40 largest banks also found that only a few are integrating climate risks into their lending practices, and setting targets to reduce 
greenhouse-gas emissions in their lending portfolios. 
"We're seeing a different mindset across the board," says Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, which published the report, Corporate Governance and Climate Change: The 
Banking Sector. "They've gotten more involved because the debate has changed," Ms. Lubber says. "This is a capital-market issue and a government issue." 

The pressure to address global climate change is coming from clients, employees, government and the banks' own research, the study said. 
"It absolutely affects their bottom line," Ms. Lubber says. 
The study rated banks on their efforts to deal with global warming. The highest-rated firms were focusing on setting internal greenhouse- gas reduction targets, boosting 

climate-related equity research and increasing lending and financing for clean-energy projects. HSBC Holdings PLC received the highest score of 70 points out of a possible 100, followed by ABN AMRO Holding NV with 66. The highest-scoring U.S. firm was Citigroup, followed by Bank of America Corp., whose score was 56. The lowest-scoring firms included Lehman Brothers Holdings, which scored 26, and Bear Stearns Cos., which got a score of 0. 
Bear Stearns said in a statement that "clearly we do not believe our score is indicative of the emphasis Bear Stearns places on environmental issues. In fact, we are proud that our world headquarters building was one of the first of any financial firm to receive Energy Star status." (Energy Star is a program sponsored by the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency that sets energy-efficiency criteria and labels products that meet these efficiency standards.) 
Many of the changes on the banks' stance toward global warming have come in the past 12 to 18 months. Among other things, the banks have issued almost 100 research 
reports on climate change. Twenty-eight of the banks disclosed their greenhouse-gas emissions from operations, and 24 have set internal reduction targets. 
Additionally, 29 of the banks reported their financial support of alternative energy, eight of them have provided more than $12 billion in financing and investments in renewable 
energy and other clean- energy projects. 

However, only 12 of the banks have board-level involvement. Additionally, only six said they are formally calculating risk from global warming in their loan portfolios. The report said Bank of America was the only bank to announce a specific target to reduce greenhouse emissions associated with the utility portion of its lending portfolio. 
Ms. Lubber says none of the institutions have set policies to avoid investing in carbon-intensive projects such as conventional coal-fired power plants or Canadian tar sands. 
The report recommended that climate change become a governance priority for company boards and CEOs, especially in the U.S. where there has been almost no board 
involvement. There also needs to be better disclosure about the financial and material risk posed by climate change. 

"We're interested in climate change because it's an issue that impacts all our clients," says Pam P. Flaherty, director of corporate citizenship for Citi. "It's an issue that impacts 
all our employees." 
At Citi, the topic has gone from a blip on the screen in 2000 to a commitment to green construction, investment and financing. 
"If you're not addressing the issue, you'll have more risks and you may not be taking advantage of opportunities," Ms. Flaherty said. 

Several other banks mentioned in the report didn't have any immediate comment. 
A report released in 2007 by Oliver Wyman found that climate change "is creating new markets and new risks," but financial institutions are better equipped than most 
industries to address the changes because of their capital mobility.

Abstract 
Based on an unconventional financing program, P2E2 will be funded by banks and equity investors which will provide loans to environmental- and energy-service companies who will boost energy efficiency in companies that use heavily polluting coal-fired plants for power.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is poised once again to save Citigroup Inc., but this time he won't do it alone. The Saudi prince will be joined by other investors including China Development Bank, people familiar with the situation said. In 1991, Prince Alwaleed invested $590 million making him the largest shareholder until last month when he ceded that title to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, which paid $7.5 billion for a 4.9% stake in the cash-strapped Citi. 
As David Enrich and Robin Sidel report, it isn't clear how much Prince Alwaleed will invest this time; the Chinese entity is expected to invest roughly $2 billion, one person said. Citi is hoping for $8 billion to $10 billion from investors, and will possibly unveil the investments tomorrow. 
Citi shares rose 45 cents to $28.56 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. The company has a stock market value of $140 billion.

TURNING ASIA GREEN: While China is ready to pass the U.S. as the world's largest carbon emitter, a U.S.-government program along with many multinational companies aims to help factories in China reduce their carbon emissions. The program will not only increase businesses' knowledge on environmental technologies, but will generate business for environmental-services companies. 
Sky Canaves and Jane Spencer take a look at the developing program known as P2E2, or pollution prevention and energy efficiency, that will arrange for China and other countries move factories onto a greener path. Based on an unconventional financing program, P2E2 will be funded by banks and equity investors which will provide loans to environmental- and energy-service companies who will boost energy efficiency in companies that use heavily polluting coal-fired plants for power. 
There are still questions about whether Chinese factories will be interested in the program, although they are a focal point of the global battle against climate change.

Abstract 
PG&E is staking its success on getting consumers to junk conventional incandescent light bulbs in favor of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps, commonly called CFLs -­corkscrew- or egg- shaped bulbs that use about a quarter as much electricity as regular bulbs and last several times as long. California policy makers have set the most ambitious conservation targets in the U.S. The state's three major investor-owned electric utilities were told last summer to reduce their combined energy use by the equivalent of three power plants to earn big bonuses -- or face the possibility of big penalties if they fail. 

Full text 
SAN FRANCISCO -- California's biggest utility is making a huge financial bet on solving a light-bulb riddle: How much energy can it conserve by getting its customers to remove one sort of bulb and screw in another? 
To cut energy costs and help reduce the emissions that cause global warming, utilities such as PG&E Corp. are facing an unusual imperative. They need to convince consumers to use less of their product. PG&E is staking its success on getting consumers to junk conventional incandescent light bulbs in favor of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps, commonly called CFLs -- corkscrew- or egg- shaped bulbs that use about a quarter as much electricity as regular bulbs and last several times as long. 
California policy makers have set the most ambitious conservation targets in the U.S. The state's three major investor-owned electric utilities were told last summer to reduce their combined energy use by the equivalent of three power plants to earn big bonuses -- or face the possibility of big penalties if they fail. 
Utilities across the country are watching for the results. About half of U.S. energy use flows through the nation's utilities, and a powerful combination of rising fuel costs and climate-change fears is putting increasing pressure on them to find ways to reduce the demand. Coal plants are causing environmental concerns, natural gas is subject to huge price swings, nuclear plants remain controversial and even wind farms are proving hard to site without opposition. So producing less energy has new appeal for utilities' bottom lines. 
PG&E and other California utilities have poured millions into subsidizing CFL bulbs, with dramatic results in the marketplace: Bulbs that cost $5 to $10 in 1999 -- and can still cost several dollars elsewhere -- can be had in California for as little as 25 cents to 50 cents. Since small rebates and conservationist appeals never made much headway in the past, utilities paid manufacturers to offer cheap bulbs branded with the utilities' logos. Big retail chains agreed to sell the bulbs at steep discounts. 
"It's a strange business," says PG&E's head of customer energy efficiency, Roland Risser. "You have to do gymnastics to get things moving forward." 
Prices are so low, in fact, that California CFLs have been showing up on store shelves in other states, and on eBay -- meaning ratepayers in California are subsidizing some bulbs that go elsewhere. 
PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric unit stands to earn or lose up to $180 million over three years under the state's conservation plan, depending to a great degree on how many CFL bulbs its customers use. The utility is counting on lighting for more than half its state- ordered conservation gains, and is spending $116 million on making CFL bulbs cheap, plentiful and attractive enough to customers. There are obstacles: In addition to the expense when the bulbs aren't subsidized, they contain a tiny amount of toxic mercury, making them harder to dispose of when they burn out or break. Early ones also gave out a cold, bluish light, but they have vastly improved. 
Some regulators are beginning to question PG&E's emphasis on light bulbs. "Is it really the best use of ratepayer money?" asks Dian Grueneich, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, adding consumers might not need such big subsidies to switch bulbs. Some officials at the California Energy Commission are skeptical as well: PG&E is "too narrowly focused" on CFLs, said Sylvia Bender, deputy director of electricity supply analysis. Utilities can also employ other measures, such as getting more energy-efficient equipment into industrial plants and commercial buildings. 
California regulators essentially are giving utilities a chance to earn as much profit by reducing energy as by producing it. The state has designated $2 billion in utility customers' payments to be spent over three years on conservation programs. The utilities need to spend that money to find ways to avoid another $2.7 billion in energy costs, by reducing demand enough that they can buy less power or build fewer plants. If they come close enough to the target, regulators award them a cut of the savings; if not, they pay a penalty. 
Lighting makes up about 37% of the average energy use in a typical California home, according to the energy commission, and CFLs can slash that part of the bill by three-quarters. But because it's mostly used at night, in most areas of the country lighting has little effect on peak power demand -- a major reason utilities build power plants. 
"They're fixated on cheap, small measures they can do, like give away light bulbs, even if there are more significant things they should be doing," says Barbara George, executive director of Women's Energy Matters, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Fairfax, Calif. She suggests more targeted measures, such as providing more energy-efficient air conditioning in areas with power-supply problems. 
PG&E says it's trying dozens of things, from helping Safeway Inc. choose more efficient chicken rotisseries to offering to pay computer manufacturers to supply more efficient power-supply units in its territory. But the utility says it doesn't know of any single measure that provides a faster, cheaper return than swapping out light bulbs. 
PG&E signed up nonprofit groups ranging from the Sierra Club to the Girl Scouts of America to help it hand out one million CFL bulbs for free last fall, and wants CFL bulbs in a quarter of all its customers' light sockets in a few years. Nationally, the Department of Energy has signed up dozens of utilities for a more modest goal: at least one compact fluorescent light in each U.S. home. Mr. Risser says that's too incremental for individual consumers to see results on their electric bill. "You've got to think big," he says. 
PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric unit, which serves one in 20 Americans, tumbled into bankruptcy protection as a result of the state's 2000-01 energy crisis, but has since bounced back with ambitions of becoming the nation's greenest utility company. "We're trying to establish a model for the rest of the nation and, maybe, the world," says Peter Darbee, PG&E's chief executive, who's become an outspoken critic of policies that he feels don't do enough to blunt climate change. 
Under California's plan, the utilities would be awarded cash equal to 12% of the costs they avoid if they meet or exceed their targets; the combined figure could range from $324 million to $450 million. Each utility earns those bonuses -- or penalties -- based on its own performance, which it has to document for regulators. They can win partial payments for coming close to their energy-saving goals, but if they miss by too much they start getting docked. For instance, if they each fall short by half, the penalties would total $234 million. The public utilities commission recently signaled it may lower the bar, however, making it easier to qualify for big bonuses -- and less likely utilities will pay penalties. 
In PG&E's third-quarter earnings call, Mr. Darbee said the utility sees its bonus pay as a core part of its earnings, not as a frill. PG&E now has 85 programs aimed at helping customers cut energy use, employing 462 people, it says. That's twice the number focused on that effort a few years ago. Mr. Risser says he has seen energy efficiency come and go as a priority in the past three decades, but says the issue has more traction now because of statewide efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. 
PG&E subsidized the sale of 7.6 million compact fluorescent bulbs last year, and this year expects to raise that to as many as 20 million, enough to fill 10% of the light sockets in Northern California homes. To overcome resistance from people who remember CFLs when they were bulkier and produced a harsh, jail-cell glare, Mr. Risser's team made a display box containing four lit bulbs behind lamp shades. They sometimes tote it to public meetings, or ask visitors if they can spot the CFLs. Most people are stymied because the hue and intensity of the CFLs and incandescent bulbs are comparable. 
Another potential hurdle for consumers is the mercury content in CFLs: It is about 1/100 the amount in a mercury thermometer, but enough for regulators to advise airing out a room for 15 minutes if one breaks. Most states allow them to be disposed of within double bags inside household trash, but some require they be recycled and handled as hazardous material. 
Retail chains have come to see their role in selling CFLs as a way to cement their own green bona fides. In October, Safeway ran a special promotion for PG&E in which it offered 23-watt CFL bulbs, which provide the illumination of 100-watt incandescent bulbs, at four bulbs for a dollar. The bulbs flew off the shelves. 
Consumers knew they were getting a bargain: PG&E bulb boxes are labeled, "We've lowered the price of this item." But they may not have known they were subsidizing an $8 subsidy per pack through their electric bills. About 20 states have rebate programs, but in the 30 states that don't, it's not uncommon to see CFL bulbs selling for $5 to $7 apiece. 
That creates an arbitrage opportunity for those able to buy them on the cheap and then mark them up for resale elsewhere, including on eBay. State utility regulators are investigating whether there's an organized effort to divert the bulbs out of state. PG&E says the overall effect is small, despite its October giveaway of one million bulbs. 
Feit Electric Co., a closely held bulb manufacturer in Pico Rivera, Calif., agreed to support the giveaway by supplying PG&E with 500,000 light bulbs at a price barely above its cost, because PG&E is such an important customer. "Utilities are transforming the market for compact fluorescents," says Aaron Feit, company president. 
Greenlite Lighting Corp. supplied an additional 275,000 bulbs. Tom Cohen, Greenlite's director of sales, said his firm saw some of its bulbs being resold on eBay and wrote eBay Inc. to complain. But he added, "There's not much we can do about it." An eBay spokesman said a listing wouldn't likely be removed if the item is owned legitimately and the sale doesn't violate intellectual-property rights, but couldn't say whether eBay was investigating. 
To give away the bulbs, PG&E enlisted nonprofit organizations including environmental groups, churches, unions and the Girl Scout Council of Northern California. Then PG&E asked suppliers to deliver the bulbs to thousands of locations, including the homes of Girl Scout troop leaders. "It was a bit of a logistical nightmare," says Kourtney Preston, national utility program specialist for Feit. 
One Girl Scout used her giveaway bags of CFLs as goodie bags for children attending her birthday party. Another of PG&E's helpers, 8- year-old Skylar Figueira-Vines of Brownie Troop 30091 in Pinole, Calif., said she found it easier to give away bulbs than sell nuts, one of the troop's yearly fund raisers. "Some people are allergic to nuts but nobody's allergic to light bulbs," she said. 
Even the Sierra Club, which has had a rocky relationship with PG&E at times over energy and environmental issues, helped -- after a vigorous debate. Some members didn't want the venerable environmental organization to be seen as serving the utility's ends. The nonprofit groups were asked to gather names and addresses of bulb recipients, so PG&E can put them in an electronic database -- which it will use to prove to regulators that it deserves its bonus payment. 
The system has spurred some criticism that utilities are focused on programs they can most easily claim credit for, and are expending major efforts in putting their fingerprints on everything. 
In November, the utilities asked the commission to allow them to begin booking earnings based on estimates of energy savings even though results won't be fully audited until 2010. They also are trying to limit the commission's ability to take back money later if it's shown they missed their goals. A new commission proposal would let them pocket millions of dollars even if they only achieve 65% of the goals, down from 85% in an earlier decision. Consumer advocates accuse the commission of caving in to utility demands. 
Mr. Risser says PG&E is looking forward to the day when there are so many CFL bulbs in use that California can adopt legislation -- already proposed -- to phase out the sale of most incandescent bulbs. He figures it'll happen when a quarter of all sockets contain CFLs. "If we get that level of penetration, no one can say it's a fad," he says.

Abstract 
It is intensifying the politics of climate change and adding urgency to the search both for fresh sources of crude and for oil alternatives once deemed fringe. China, in a bid to limit demand and the huge fuel subsidies it gives consumers, announced in October that it would impose an almost 10% increase in domestic prices for gasoline and diesel fuel. 

Full text 
The surging price of oil, from just over $10 a barrel a decade ago to $100 yesterday, is altering the wealth and influence of nations and industries around the world. 
These power shifts will only widen if prices keep climbing, as many analysts predict. Costly oil already is forcing sweeping changes in the airline and auto sectors. It is intensifying the politics of climate change and adding urgency to the search both for fresh sources of crude and for oil alternatives once deemed fringe. 
The long oil-price boom is posing wrenching challenges for the world's poorest nations, while enriching and emboldening producers in the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela. Their increasing muscle has a flip side: a decline of U.S. clout in many parts of the world. 
Steep gasoline prices also threaten America's long love affair with the automobile, while putting strains on many lower-income people outside big cities, who must spend an increasing share of their budgets just on fuel to get to work. 
No one can say for sure whether sky-high oil -- part of a price boom in a wide range of commodities, from gold to wheat -- is here to stay. But most in the industry agree that a 20-year stretch in which oil was consistently cheap is long gone. The global thirst for oil shows little sign of retreating, and large new discoveries are few. Some in the industry say prices could go far higher; others suspect that speculators -- or an economic slump in the U.S. or China -- could send prices falling in the near term. 
Yesterday, with a single trade, crude-oil futures hit an intraday high of $100 a barrel, a record for the U.S. benchmark. For the day, they rose $3.64 to a record close of $99.62 a barrel. Crude is still shy of the inflation-adjusted peak of $102.81 a barrel set in April 1980, amid political turmoil in Iran and unrest elsewhere in the Middle East. The 1980 peak in nominal terms was $39.50 a barrel. 
The arrival of $100-a-barrel oil adds to the pressure on the U.S. economy, which has sustained a big blow from a drop in housing prices and a wave of foreclosures. Even at today's prices, though, the oil spike alone isn't enough to push the world into recession, economists say. 
When crude oil hit its 1980 high, drivers squealed and the economy slumped. So far there is no comparable pain, and America, which consumes a quarter of the world's crude, retains its taste for big cars and energy-devouring homes. That's largely because the U.S. economy is more efficient and most Americans spend less of their disposable income ­
-about 4% -- on gasoline than in 1980, when they spent about 6%. 
The robust economies of Asia, especially China, have so far swallowed the price surges with relative ease. That's because the price spurt this time is itself largely caused by surging demand within the developing world, not by politically induced supply shocks as in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
But there are signs of strain. China, in a bid to limit demand and the huge fuel subsidies it gives consumers, announced in October that it would impose an almost 10% increase in domestic prices for gasoline and diesel fuel. Other countries that heavily subsidize domestic fuel use, which include the oil-rich states Iran and Venezuela, are feeling the pinch as prices climb. 
Oil's run-up is bringing the most startling changes of all to the Middle East. Big producers like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are using their billions in profits to build their economies with roads, schools, airports and entire new cities. The value of hydrocarbon exports from the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to approach $750 billion this year, almost four times the level in 2001, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
The region's new wealth has triggered a bout of deal making that has bankers rushing to the petrostates of the Persian Gulf. McKinsey & Co. estimates that the world's biggest investors of petrodollars -- including state-owned vehicles known as sovereign-wealth funds -- now manage as much as $3.8 trillion in assets. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which McKinsey estimates manages $900 billion in assets, is today among the world's largest financial-market participants -- about the same size as the Bank of Japan. 
Underscoring the region's new global financial heft, Abu Dhabi recently swooped to the rescue of Citigroup Inc. with a $7.5 billion cash infusion as it struggled with write-downs from this year's credit crisis. 
Even before that deal, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, spent about $124.3 billion in the past three years buying up foreign companies, real estate and other assets, according to London-based Dealogic. One transaction underscores the region's financial-markets ambitions. Dubai, also part of the UAE, agreed to a complex deal with Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. that essentially gives Dubai major stakes in Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange and Nordic exchange OMX AB. 
This wave of oil wealth is blunting America's influence. Oil money has galvanized the might of Russia under President Vladimir Putin. He has overseen a dramatic consolidation of power and rollback of democracy in Moscow, while sticking a thumb in the West's eye on issues ranging from independence for Kosovo to the U.S. bid to build an anti-Iran missile-defense system in Europe. 
Surging oil prices have also weakened the Bush administration's efforts to use financial pressure to get Iran to back off its nuclear program. China, eager to secure all possible access to energy, increasingly is turning to Iran as a trading partner, with oil going east and Chinese technology heading the other way. High oil revenue, meanwhile, has kept the otherwise rickety Iranian economy humming and Iran's current government firmly in power. 
In Khartoum, the once-drowsy capital of Sudan, glimmering skyscrapers are rising along the Nile as oil riches attract investors from Asia and the Persian Gulf. Sudan, accused by Washington of supporting terror groups and killing civilians in Darfur, had been hobbled for years by U.S. economic sanctions. Those restrictions are having less effect now, with the desire for oil resources high and with both know-how and capital pouring in from the Gulf and Asia. 
Venezuela will continue to use its oil prod, perhaps more aggressively than any other country. In 2005, in one of a series of jabs at the U.S., Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez began offering cut- rate heating oil to poor neighborhoods of the Northeastern U.S. He also has used favorably priced fuel to prop up Fidel Castro and win friends in South America, while shouldering aside U.S. efforts to champion regional trade deals. 
For poor nations that don't produce oil, the past several years have been a full-blown oil shock. The price rise adds another obstacle to providing modern energy to the estimated 1.6 billion people who have no access to electricity and the 2.4 billion who cook with traditional sources like wood, coal or dung. A recent World Bank study concluded that a sustained $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil translates roughly into a 1.5% knock to the gross domestic product of the world's poorest countries. 
Few places have been harder hit than Malawi, a small southern Africa country with annual per capita gross domestic product of just $179. According to the World Bank report, a $10 oil-price increase is expected to translate into a 2.2% fall in the GDP of Malawi, where tobacco is the dominant cash drop. 
Malawi subsidizes the price of gasoline and paraffin, a petroleum- derived fuel its people use for lighting and cooking. But according to an IMF study, the government is now passing along to the population all fresh increases in energy costs, and then some. Pump prices in Lilongwe, the capital, climbed about 19% in October, to the equivalent of $5.16 a gallon. 
"When gasoline goes up, everything goes up, so we really have to struggle to earn a living," said James Mdachi, 43 years old, an assistant accountant for the government. He and his wife, a teacher, bring in about $200 a month, to support three children and five other dependents. 
A world away, U.S. industry has so far managed to take the oil surge in stride, although economists fret that this may not last long. Auto makers, for instance, may have even more reason to fear high oil prices today than they did in the late 1970s, when price shocks and gas lines tipped Detroit's auto giants into crisis. Then and now, surging petroleum prices caught U.S. auto makers with model lineups full of powerful rear-wheel-drive vehicles designed for an era of cheap gas. 
Auto makers have more things to fret about now. Surging oil prices embolden political leaders to call for tougher fuel-efficiency standards and other moves to discourage car use, such as fees that London and some other big cities levy on commuters who drive into congested districts. These ideas are gaining traction because of concern that petroleum-fueled cars and trucks exacerbate climate change. Groups worried about global warming are finding allies in more-conservative circles whose main concern is to enhance security by reducing reliance on oil from unstable nations. 
After 20 years of largely leaving fuel-economy standards alone, the U.S. in December enacted an energy bill that requires auto makers to boost the average efficiency of their new-vehicle fleets to 35 miles a gallon from 27.5 by 2020. Auto makers got some important concessions, such as credits for building vehicles designed to burn ethanol and a new classification system that will make it easier for them to continue to sell larger vehicles. But the bill marks the end of an age in which the industry was able to make vehicles heavier and more powerful without making significant gains in fuel efficiency. 
Moreover, the 2007 energy bill may not be the last auto makers hear from Washington. As part of her presidential campaign program, Sen. Hillary Clinton has proposed a target of 55 miles per gallon for cars and trucks by 2030. 
These proposals threaten a fundamental automotive marketing strategy: Bigger is better. Industry executives, particularly in Detroit, worry that without the freedom to market large, powerful vehicles, their businesses will be decimated. 
The fall of the Ford Explorer is emblematic of how $3-a-gallon gasoline has undermined Detroit's profit model. In 1999, Ford sold more than 428,000 of the midsize sport-utility vehicles, at an estimated $4,000 in profit each, and earned record profits of $7.2 billion. In 2007, through November, Ford sold just 126,930 Explorers. 
Costly fuel gives a further edge to Japanese makers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. because of their expertise in small- vehicle and small-engine design. And if more markets tilt toward small, efficient diesel engines, as Western Europe already has, that's a plus for European companies such as Volkswagen AG or Renault SA. 
General Motors Corp., the biggest U.S. car maker, is gambling that it can develop its own technology for plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles fast enough to stay in the game. GM is heavily promoting its plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt model, even though it isn't due to hit the market until 2010. 
In the global airline industry, meanwhile, pessimists just a few years ago were predicting that some carriers would fail if crude hit $45. The industry has proved adaptable, with airlines grounding their oldest and thirstiest planes, raising fares and drastically reducing labor and operating expenses. 
But if oil's ascent keeps pushing up jet fuel prices, travelers are sure to feel a squeeze. John Heimlich, an economist for the Air Transport Association, predicts that if oil stays where it is or goes higher, airlines will identify their worst-performing routes and then cut the number of flights assigned to them, substitute smaller planes or cancel the routes. 
Oil's rising cost is sure to put a sharper focus on calls to promote alternative fuels and curb burning of carbon-based fuels. The record there so far is decidedly mixed. 
Pricey oil and a quest for "energy independence" have led to an ethanol boom, but higher corn prices now pinch that industry's profits. Historically, ethanol sold at a premium to gasoline; today there's so much ethanol available that it's selling at a discount. 
Even in abundance, ethanol is a tiny factor in the U.S. fuel market, displacing a little more than 200 million barrels of crude oil annually, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. The blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline called E85 is available at only bout 1,400 of the roughly 170,000 U.S. fuel stations. And though ethanol is blended into most U.S. gasoline, at up to 10%, calls to dial up that percentage have sparked controversy because of concern this might increase certain forms of air pollution. 
Paradoxically, the high oil price in some ways hinders the quest to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. The oil price makes it economic to develop unconventional deposits such as Canada's oil sands. But the gummy substance is mined, and turning it into usable products takes extensive refining. Gallon for gallon, producing gasoline from oil sands emits far more carbon dioxide than making it from conventional crude. 
The price rise has a similarly dirty impact at power plants. In the 1990s, when natural gas was cheap, many countries pushed to use more of that, in place of coal, to make electricity. This was good for the environment, because per unit of energy generated, natural gas emits about half as much CO2. But natural-gas prices roughly track oil prices, and they've been rising too. Their rise has prompted a resurgence in coal use, one reason greenhouse-gas emissions are going up faster than many expected. China, the second-largest oil user after the U.S., still meets the bulk of its energy needs with coal. 
Oil's price run-up is fanning support for a revival of clean but controversial nuclear energy. The International Energy Agency, an energy watchdog for the U.S. and 25 other wealthy nations, has become a big promoter of nuclear power. Still, its latest annual outlook predicted the use of nuclear energy would grow by less than 1% annually world­wide between now and 2030, while coal usage would rise three times as fast. 
The great oil boom of the 2000s has also wrought dramatic changes within the oil industry itself, which high prices will only intensify. 
Oil-rich nations, seeking to take greater command of their resources, are marginalizing the once-mighty Western oil companies. For the first time since World War II, the future of oil and gas production isn't in the hands of Texas-educated engineers working for U.S. companies but of executives at companies like Qatar Petroleum and Russian behemoth OAO Gazprom. 
Gone are the days when companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC had an unmatchable combination of financial clout and technological know-how. Thanks to several years of high prices, government-controlled oil companies have the financial muscle to bankroll their own projects. 
And they have access to the latest tools for finding oil and drilling holes. During the last downturn, in the 1990s, big oil companies outsourced many of these tasks to oil-field­service companies. Now the national oil companies can hire these service companies directly, bypassing integrated Western oil giants. 
Schlumberger Ltd., the largest oilfield-service company by market value, has said its revenue from national oil companies tripled from 2002 through 2006, while its work for Western oil companies rose just 60%. "The growing influence of national oil and gas companies on the world energy market is abundantly evident even to the casual observer," ConocoPhillips Chief Executive James Mulva said in March. 
As the state-owned giants grow more confident and self-sufficient, they have begun to compete aggressively for resources beyond their borders. Last year, Libya put some potentially oil-rich acreage out for bids. While Exxon Mobil won some of it, so too did state- controlled oil companies from Russia, India and China. 
More than from their bank accounts, national oil companies' strength stems from their control of resources. Exxon Mobil, with a market capitalization of around $500 billion, is one of the largest and most successful publicly traded companies ever. But there are 12 state- controlled oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and PetroChina Co., that control more oil reserves. 
Driving this power shift is geology. Major new finds in North America and Europe have been rare for two decades. Western oil companies now control only about one in 10 barrels of the world's proven reserves. As the Western giants struggle to find fresh oil, the Aramcos of the world are only likely to rise in importance in the years ahead.

The Wall Street Journal Online 
The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here. 
Amid a market selloff over oil's brief flirtation with $100 and new signs that American factories are feeling other sectors' pain, minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting suggest an interest-rate cut at its next gathering isn't a sure thing. 
First the bad economic news, which contributed to yesterday's 220.86-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a 1.7% chute that left the index at 13043.96. The Institute for Supply Management said its survey of manufacturing purchasing managers produced a factory-activity index of 47.7 in December, down from 50.8 the previous month. Any reading under 50 indicates contracting activity in the sector. And the forward-looking index for new orders had an even steeper fall to 45.7. "Until now, factories have shown resilience in the face of housing turmoil and high oil prices, in large part because exports of products like airplanes and mining machines helped offset slumping sales of domestically oriented items such as lawn mowers and wallboard," The Wall Street Journal notes. "But the latest figures from the factory floor are heightening recession worries and confirm the view that the slowdown is spilling over to a growing list of goods-producing industries." 
News of the ISM survey aggravated a drop in the dollar against the euro and the yen, which in turn led to a jump in gold prices and played a role in light sweet crude futures' short spike to the $100-a- barrel mark, as the Financial Times notes. When trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange finished yesterday, it settled at a record close of $99.62 a barrel, up $3.64 for the day, and it was down a bit more in electronic Nymex trading early today. If oil prices stay this high -- and how many times have you heard such "if"s in the past few years? -- world economic growth could suffer, even as costly oil tests "the progress made by many of the world's industrialized economies toward greater energy efficiency since the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s," the Journal notes. In theory, global and U.S. economic worries are supposed to dampen oil prices, but that theory hasn't been holding up much lately. The more-than-five-year-old boom in prices for oil and other commodities shows no sign of slowing, as the Journal points out, with wheat and a host of other goods joining the price increases enjoyed yesterday by oil and gold. 
Which takes us back to the Fed. The headline that most frequently emerged from yesterday's release of the Dec. 11 Fed meeting minutes was policy makers' willingness to lower rates again as needed -- no surprise, really, considering how much uncertainty their public statement contained. And it didn't do much to assuage investors' anxiety. But another subject Federal Open Market Committee members talked about a lot was energy and the dollar, which seem to have replaced tight labor markets as their biggest source of inflation worry. While FOMC members generally expect their key indicator of core inflation -- excluding energy and food prices -- to trend lower in the coming years, "participants remained concerned about upside risks to inflation stemming from elevated prices of energy and non-energy commodities," the minutes say. Some also cited the weaker dollar, which boosts import prices. And "participants agreed that continued stable inflation expectations would be essential to achieving and sustaining a downward trend to inflation, that well-anchored expectations couldn't be taken for granted." 
The minutes go on to say that while "softening in the outlook for economic growth warranted" the easing of monetary policy -- the quarter-point interest-rate cut they announced after the meeting -- "members noted that policy had already been eased by [three quarters of a point] and that the effects of those actions on the real economy would be evident only with a lag." With inflation risks still out there, FOMC members reasoned, the quarter-point cut was as far as they could go considering how "unusually uncertain" the situation was. This was why the committee refrained from giving its usual assessment of the balance of risks between threats to economic growth and the threat of inflation. They both acknowledged that "financial stresses could increase further, intensifying the contraction in housing markets and restraining other forms of spending," and "recognized that financial market conditions might improve more rapidly than members expected, in which case a reversal of some of the rate cuts might become appropriate." 
So, ahead of the FOMC's next meeting Jan. 29-30, it seems committee members will be asking two key questions: Have economic and credit conditions worsened so much more that they need to lower the cost of borrowed money yet again? And would any such move -- after the interest-rate cuts they have already made -- risk stoking inflation expectations at a time when high oil costs and a weak dollar may be flowing through the price pipeline to be making everything else more expensive? 
A Special Prosecutor Named for CIA Tapes 
Attorney General Michael Mukasey yesterday stepped up the inquiry into the CIA's destruction of terrorist-interrogation tapes to a full criminal investigation and named a career federal prosecutor from outside of Washington to take charge. Mr. Mukasey said the FBI's investigation would be led by John Durham. He's the Justice Department's No. 2 in Connecticut and a man Legal Times describes as "a widely respected prosecutor in the New England law enforcement community" who was picked by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in the late 1990s to lead a probe of FBI-mob connections in Boston. Mr. Mukasey didn't say why U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg of the Eastern District of Virginia -­which has jurisdiction over the CIA -- recused himself. But it was Mr. Rosenberg's office that presided over the Zacarias Moussaoui prosecution and acknowledged to the judge in that case this past fall that the CIA made "factual errors" in reporting it had no videotapes of detainee interrogations. 
Mr. Durham wasn't named as a special counsel in this case, which would have given him expanded authority, a move that upset some congressional Democrats. But Mr. Mukasey's announcement marks the first sign that officials have preliminarily concluded a crime may have been committed through destruction of the tapes, the New York Times notes. "CIA officials have for years feared becoming entangled in a criminal investigation involving alleged improprieties in secret counterterrorism programs," the Times notes. "Now, the investigation and a probable grand jury inquiry will scrutinize the actions of some of the highest-ranking current and former officials at the agency." While Justice Department officials declined to say what crimes might be under investigation, government lawyers tell the Times the inquiry will probably seek to determine if obstruction of justice or false statements took place. House and Senate intelligence committee leaders said their separate inquiries would also continue, the Washington Post reports. 
Protests Put Down in Nairobi 
Kenyan authorities today were trying to head off the "million-man" rally called by opposition leader and presidential candidate Raila Odinga, with riot police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse crowds of protesters and throwing up checkpoints at what the Associated Press calls strategic spots to block groups from reaching Nairobi. The intertribal violence that followed President Mwai Kibaki's declaration of victory against Mr. Odinga on Sunday has left 300 people killed and displaced 100,000, according to the AP's estimate. Both men have accused each other of fueling the ethnic violence even as they express willingness to talk. The latest outside attempt at mediation came from South African Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu, who flew to Nairobi and was expected to meet Mr. Odinga later today. But a government spokesman said Mr. Kibaki had no plans to meet Mr. Tutu. Daniel Kibigo, a brick mason picking through the wreckage of a church burned in Western Kenya in one of the most striking attacks this week, yesterday told the New York Times: "The violence will end when the politicians want to end it." 
Also of Note. . . 
Financial Times: Stock exchanges outside the U.S. -- including the London Stock Exchange -- could provide direct trading access to U.S. investors through U.S.-based brokers for the first time under proposals being prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Restrictions on the ability of foreign brokers to solicit U.S. investors could also be removed. 
BBC: China plans to expand the use of lethal injections to replace execution by shooting, according to Jiang Xingchang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, who said the government believes lethal injections are more humane. 
Los Angeles Times: California and 15 other states sued the Bush administration, seeking to overturn a federal decision last month that rejected the state's bid to curb greenhouse gases from cars and trucks. The lawsuit marks a new round in an epic five-year struggle between California and the federal government over whether states have the power to regulate carbon dioxide and other pollutants that cause global warming. 
Associated Press: China has decided to restrict the broadcasting of Internet videos -- including those posted on video-sharing Web sites -- to sites run by state-controlled companies and require providers to report questionable content to the government. It wasn't immediately clear how the new rules would affect YouTube and other providers of Internet video that host Web sites available in China but are based in other countries. 
Government Executive: The U.S. Census Bureau's program to develop handheld computers to collect data on Americans during the 2010 census is in "serious trouble," and the bureau should immediately develop plans to use paper forms, according to an analysis conducted by a government research firm and presented to top bureau managers in late 2007. 
New York Times: The Weather Channel, one of the last privately owned cable channels, is being put up for sale and could fetch more than $5 billion as part of a larger breakup of its parent, Landmark Communications, according to people briefed on the auction. The channel and its rapidly growing Web site, weather.com, are already attracting interest from some of the biggest names in media, including NBC, News Corp., and Comcast, these people said. 
American Banker: National City's chief said the bank's plan to cut 900 additional jobs and slash its dividend -- the result of ongoing residential-loan losses -- is more than a quick fix and will bolster the company for the next few years, while analysts said it probably will not be the last company to shore up capital this year by reducing its payout to shareholders. 
Women's Wear Daily: Post-Christmas clearances and gift card redemptions have brought some relief to retailers' holiday hangovers. Many merchants said that with the uptick, sales plans for the quarter were now attainable and inventories were under control. But there was concern that margins suffered and that consumers will tighten up even more in 2008, increasing the angst that seems to pervade the industry. 
The Hill: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor to serve in either chamber of Congress and the founding member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, announced he would not seek reelection for the California seat he first won 28 years ago because he has been diagnosed with cancer. 
Variety: Sean Penn has been named the jury president for this year's Cannes Film Festival, which will take place from May 14-25 in the French Mediterranean town. 
Guardian: The ability of forests to soak up man-made carbon dioxide is weakening, according to an analysis of two decades of data from more than 30 sites in the frozen north. The finding published today is crucial, because it means that more of the CO2 we release will end up affecting the climate in the atmosphere rather than being safely locked away in trees or soil. 
Quote of the Day 
"It's kind of like, you know, you can't wait. Maybe it's like Christmas morning and you want to run down and open the present and see what you got and hope it's not a lump of coal," said Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during one of a series of events he held yesterday around Iowa ahead of today's caucus. With the competitions in both parties still too close to call, the leading candidates raced between colleges and small towns to make their last pitches, well aware that the contests would be decided by the lavish turnout operations they spent millions of dollars and much of the past year building, the Washington Post reports.

Wall Street spent much of the year in turmoil as the underestimated risks of subprime loans haunted the financial world. The Federal Reserve, lawmakers and central banks scrambled to ease the resulting credit crunch. Despite declining home values, weak corporate earnings and recession fears, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year 6.4% higher. 
Benazir Bhutto's assassination plunged Pakistan into deeper disarray. Hamas took over the Gaza Strip. President Bush sent more troops to Iraq, where signs of stability appeared despite the Blackwater furor. U.S. presidential hopefuls prepared for the 2008 race; many government and corporate officials resigned. 
Here is a summary of events as chronicled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, the dates are when the items were published. 
January 2007 
2 The Dow Jones Industrial Average begins 2007 at 12463.15, after gaining 16% in 2006, but the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market close in observance of a national day of mourning for former President Gerald Ford. Mr. Ford, eulogized by President George W. Bush as a "rock of stability," is buried the next day on the Grand Rapids, Mich., grounds of his presidential museum. 
U.S. military deaths in Iraq since the war began in March 2003 pass 3,000, according to an Associated Press tally. The December total of at least 113 makes it 2006's deadliest month. The U.S. death toll is 823 for 2006. 
4 Home Depot Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Nardelli steps down with an exit package valued at about $210 million, including $20 million in cash severance. He is succeeded by Frank Blake, the retailer's vice chairman and executive vice president. 
Federal Reserve minutes suggest some officials have doubts about inflation and the economic-expansion outlook. Stocks fall on the news but end up 11.37 at 12474.52 in the first full trading day of 2007. 
The Democrat-controlled 110th Congress convenes, ending 12 years of Republican rule. A day later, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is elected the first woman Speaker of the House and moves to tighten ethics rules. In the Senate, Harry Reid (D., Nev.), is elected Majority Leader. 
5 Harriet Miers resigns as White House counsel after many years at President Bush's side and a failed Supreme Court bid. Bush aides deny any exodus of staff. 
9 As Hugo Chavez begins a second six-year term as Venezuela's president, he vows to nationalize the nation's big telecom and electricity companies, to throw out its commercial code and to strip the central bank of its autonomy. 
10 Apple Inc. introduces a media-playing cellphone, dubbed the iPhone, that lets users download and play music, browse the Web, send emails and make calls.

A spokesman for Mr. Hsu declines comment. 
11 Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, outlines a plan to end the troop surge by next summer, as the number of American troops there climbs to nearly 170,000. He leaves unanswered how quickly the pullout will proceed beyond then. Gen. Petraeus later testifies the "surge" of 30,000 U.S. troops is working better than any previous effort to quell the insurgency and restore stability. 
12 Crude rises 74 cents to a record $78.23 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as uncertainty about global supplies overshadow the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to raise output limits by roughly 500,000 barrels a day, its first official production increase in more than two years. Oil prices briefly top $80 a barrel for the first time the next day and finish above that benchmark by week's end. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resigns after less than a year in office, with his government damaged by scandals and loss of control of the upper house of Parliament. Mr. Abe is succeeded by party elder Yasuo Fukuda.

15 Tepid retail sales and manufacturing in August offer more signs the economy is softening. 
Northern Rock PLC's shares slide 31% after the United Kingdom lender discloses the Bank of England has agreed to provide short-term funding to alleviate a "severe liquidity squeeze."

18 The Iraqi government bans Blackwater Worldwide from working in the country following a gunbattle between Iraqi insurgents and Blackwater security guards who were protecting a State Department convoy. More than a dozen Iraqi civilians are killed by gunfire; Blackwater says its guards reacted to an ambush and returned "defensive fire." The incident sparks a lengthy furor and forces Congress and Baghdad to scrutinize how security contractors operate in Iraq. The uproar escalates through autumn, with a Blackwater advisory- board member whose brother is a top State Department official resigning in November amid criticism from Democrats. By year's end, a pact between the Pentagon and State Department tightens U.S. military control over Blackwater and other security firms in Iraq. 
19 The Fed cuts the federal-funds rate, the benchmark target rate for overnight lending between banks, by half a percentage point to 4.75%, exceeding the expected quarter-point cut most economists had expected. The move shows Mr. Bernanke, fearing broad damage from the market turmoil that erupted a month ago, prefers to risk doing too much rather than too little. 
21 Gold soars to a 27 1/2-year high of $732.40 a troy ounce on combination of a weak dollar and increasing inflation fears. 
25 General Motors Corp. workers walk out of factories across the U.S. in the first United Auto Workers strike to hit the auto maker since 1998. Production at GM's more than 80 facilities shuts down, idling 73,000 workers. Within days, GM and the UAW reach a tentative pact that covers about 74,000 U.S. workers. The UAW trades company- provided retiree health care and a longstanding insistence on equal pay for all workers in return for GM commitments to invest in plants and fund $29.9 billion for a new health-care trust. The pact also sets up a mechanism for GM to buy out thousands of workers. 
26 Myanmar's military leaders impose a curfew and ban gatherings of more than five people after 35,000 Buddhist monks and their supporters stage protests demanding an end to military rule. In the following days, security forces open fire on the protesters.

5 A three-way consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC wins enough support from ABN Amro Holding NV shareholders to seal the biggest banking deal ever and end a monthslong saga.

Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto forge an agreement designed to let them shepherd the nation from military rule to civilian government. The pact would let Ms. Bhutto return to Pakistan to run for prime minister. The next day, Pakistan's Supreme Court throws the country into political confusion that will last weeks. The court says a scheduled presidential vote can go ahead but that results won't be official until it decides whether Mr. Musharraf is eligible to stand for re-election while retaining his army-chief post. 
11 Chrysler LLC and the United Auto Workers agree to a tentative labor deal hours after workers go on strike. The pact includes the creation of a health-care trust fund. General Motors Corp.'s unionized workers ratify a four-year deal.

19 Pfizer Inc. posts a 77% drop in profit and says it is pulling insulin inhaler Exubera after disappointing sales. The decision to shelve the product results in a $2.8 billion pretax hit to earnings. 
Suicide bombings in Pakistan accompany Ms. Bhutto's return home, as the former prime minister ends eight years of self-imposed exile after reaching a power-sharing agreement with Mr. Musharraf. After the opposition leader lands in Karachi, two explosions near her cavalcade kill at least 136 people, but she is unharmed. She later blames al Qaeda and Taliban militants for trying to kill her and accuses Pakistan's government of not providing enough security to protect her. 
23 Microsoft Corp. ends its nine-year fight with European Union antitrust regulators and agrees to license information that rivals need to make their software work better with certain versions of Windows.

Shares fall 5.8%, and the company's credit rating is downgraded. Days later, Merrill CEO Stan O'Neal retires, walking away with $161.5 million in restricted stock, options and retirement benefits. Merrill's board names director Alberto Cribiore to lead a search for a successor, leaving current management largely in place. The Securities and Exchange Commission scrutinizes the adequacy of the firm's disclosures to investors about an $8.4 billion write-down that fueled Mr. O'Neal's ouster.

8 GM posts a $38.96 billion loss due to a tax-credit write-down, one of the biggest quarterly losses for a U.S. company. GM also cites its string of losses in North America and 
Germany and weakness at its GMAC unit.

end. 
10 Merck & Co. agrees to pay $4.85 billion to settle lawsuits tied to withdrawn painkiller Vioxx. Merck had vowed to defend liability suits one by one ever since Vioxx was pulled

The CIA says it destroyed videotaped interrogations of terror suspects. Agency Director Michael Hayden says the two tapes, made in 2002 as part of an internal check, are destroyed out of fear they would be leaked to the public and reveal CIA identities.

14 Citigroup bails out seven affiliated structured-investment vehicles, or SIVs, bringing $49 billion in assets onto its balance sheet and further denting its capital base. The move

centerpieces of the administration's approach to calm homeowners and markets.

outbid.

Letters: [Letter],"Monosodium glutamate, and all of its stealth identities, are known causes of headaches in the vast majority of migraine sufferers. While Julia Moskin can be commended for detailing many of the pseudonyms and secret identities by which MSG can masquerade, she glosses over its negative effects, giving MSG a pass just because the F.D.A. said it was safe ''for the vast majority of consumers.'' The presence of MSG in so many foods makes eating virtually anything processed, packaged or ''flavored'' off-limits to those who suffer from migraines, and can make a trip to the grocery store or eating out an arduous and literally hazardous process, as one tries to pick one's way through the minefield of potential trigger foods. It was a pleasure to read about Louis Begley's version of bigos, the traditional Polish Hunter's Stew (''A Stew With a Past and a Future,'' Feb. 27).

Banks Springing Up to Serve the Underserved,"For bankers, focusing on a niche is a way to set themselves apart from the competition. ''If a person sees three banks on the same block, each one offering the same products at the same price, what differentiates you?'' asks Steven F. Young, senior vice president for consumer banking at Wainwright Bank and Trust in Boston. Wainwright's reputation as a socially responsible bank that invests most of its deposits in community development and progressive nonprofit organizations ''has led us to be very profitable,'' Mr. Young said. ''People like what we're doing with their money.'' In fact, Mr. [David Flores] said, ''25 or 30 Hispanic banks are either starting up now or have started up in the last two or three years.'' Among them is Plaza Bank in Seattle, which offers low-fee fund transfers and Spanish-language checks, statements, loan applications and online banking. ''All of our personnel are bilingual and bicultural,'' says Carlos Guangorena, Plaza Bank's chief executive. ''That helps people who haven't been banked come into the fabric of the economic community.'' Similarly, many of the nation's almost five million Muslims have special banking concerns that often go unaddressed by mainstream banks. In particular, Sharia, Islamic law, forbids the charging or paying of interest. ''This hampers most bank transactions,'' said Amjad Quadri, assistant vice president for business development and new markets at the University Islamic Financial Corporation, a bank based in Ann Arbor, Mich. As a result, many Muslims decide to rent rather than buy homes. ''And most Muslims only have interest-free checking accounts and credit cards that they pay off at the end of the month,'' Mr. Quadri said.",433815888,Newspapers,"Galst, Liz", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Mar 8, 2008", Feature," Mar 8, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, C.6," New York, N.Y.","Mar 8, 2008",New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433815888?accountid=14902, C.6," Community banks , Minority banks , Muslims , Hispanics , Environmental protection",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Banks+Springing+Up+to+Serve+the+Underserved&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-03-08&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=C.6&amp;au=Galst%2C+Liz&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream
Turning Glare Into Watts: [Series],"The solar plants receive a federal tax subsidy, like other types of renewable energy, which makes the economics work for builders but also feeds skepticism about the technology's long-term potential.

''It's logical to talk about burden-sharing in terms of per capita emissions entitlements, or some other principle. The main point is that we must first agree on a principle that is felt to be fair.'' The United Nations climate chief, Yvo de Boer, while acknowledging India's resistance to mandatory emissions cuts as ''a fair position,'' said on a recent visit that the ball was in India's court to offer alternatives. ''It's clear to me that developing countries don't want binding targets,'' Mr. de Boer said. ''Now I want to hear what they do want.'' ''It causes me deep anguish,'' said Rajendra K.

"Flooded Village Files Suit, Citing Corporate Link to Climate Change","In an unusual move, those five companies and three other defendants -- the Exxon Mobil Corporation, American Electric Power and the Conoco Phillips Company -- are also accused of conspiracy. ''There has been a long campaign by power, coal and oil companies to mislead the public about the science of global warming,'' the suit says. The campaign, it says, contributed ''to the public nuisance of global warming by convincing the public at large and the victims of global warming that the process is not man-made when in fact it is.'' Kivalina, an Inupiat village of 400 people on a barrier reef between the Chukchi Sea and two rivers, is being buffeted by waves that, in colder times, were blocked by sea ice, the suit says. ''The result of the increased storm damage is a massive erosion problem,'' it says. ''Houses and buildings are in imminent danger of falling into the sea.''

Scientists Would Turn Greenhouse Gas Into Gasoline,"In the efforts to reduce humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide, now nearing 30 billion metric tons a year, most of the attention so far has focused on large stationary sources, like power plants where, conceptually at least, one could imagine a shift from fuels that emit carbon dioxide -- coal and natural gas -- to those that do not -- nuclear, solar and wind. Another strategy, known as carbon capture and storage, would continue the use of fossil fuels but trap the carbon dioxide and then pipe it underground where it would not affect the climate. Three solutions have been offered: hydrogen-powered fuel cells, electric cars and biofuels. Biofuels like ethanol are gasoline substitutes produced from plants like corn, sugar cane or switch grass, and the underlying idea is the same as Green Freedom. Plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, balancing out the carbon dioxide emitted when they are burned. But growing crops for fuel takes up wide swaths of land. ''It's definitely worth pursuing,'' said Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University. ''It's not that new an idea. It has a couple of pieces to it that are interesting.''",433779230,Newspapers,"Chang, Kenneth", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 19, 2008", Feature," Feb 19, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, F.2," New York, N.Y.","Feb 19, 2008",New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433779230?accountid=14902, F.2," Carbon dioxide , Greenhouse gases , Air pollution , Global warming , Alternative energy sources , Gasoline",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Scientists+Would+Turn+Greenhouse+Gas+Into+Gasoline&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-02-19&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=F.2&amp;au=Chang%2C+Kenneth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream
Clean Power or Dirty Coal?: [Editorial],"This is good news. Coal-fired power plants are big contributors to global warming. In the United States alone, they generate half the country's electricity and nearly a third of its emissions. Meanwhile, scientists have left no doubt that the world has just a few years to make deep cuts in emissions or begin to suffer the worst consequences of rising temperatures. This means that scientists will have to figure out a way to capture carbon dioxide from coal plants, or coal will have to be replaced with cleaner fuels. As we have said before, the surest and probably the only way to encourage meaningful and swift commercial development of cleaner fuels and energy sources is to put a stiff price on carbon emissions. That, in turn, would inspire -- indeed require -- industry to invest heavily in energy efficiency and low-carbon fuels.",433779328,Newspapers,, NYTIAO," Congress

A 'Bold' Step to Capture an Elusive Gas Falters,"So there was much enthusiasm five years ago when the Bush administration said it would pursue ''one of the boldest steps our nation has taken toward a pollution-free energy future'' by building a commercial-scale coal-fire plant that would emit no carbon dioxide -- the greenhouse gas that makes those plants major contributors to global warming. David G. Hawkins, an energy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the new approach would have been a good move four years ago. ''But to tout FutureGen for five years and then in the president's last year pull the plug is just bait and switch,'' he said. Vaclav Smil, an energy expert at the University of Manitoba, has estimated that capturing and burying just 10 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted over a year from coal-fire plants at current rates would require moving volumes of compressed carbon dioxide greater than the total annual flow of oil worldwide -- a massive undertaking requiring decades and trillions of dollars.

[C1.] LAZARD'S STRONG QUARTER Lazard, the investment bank run by Bruce Wasserstein, reported a 43 percent jump in its fourth-quarter profit, setting itself apart from banks reporting steep losses. It was Lazard's second consecutive quarter of strong growth.

He said the state's Congressional delegation was ''determined to find an environmentally responsible way to use our coal to generate electricity.'' ''We believe in the future of coal,'' he said. The budget request that the White House will send to Congress next week will include $648 million for new ''clean coal'' research, 25 percent more than the request for the current year, he added.",433756677,Newspapers,"Wald, Matthew L", NYTIAO," Department of Energy

Commodities' Relentless Surge,"''It is absolutely a fundamental change in the global economic structure,'' said Bart Melek, global commodities strategist for BMO Capital Markets, an investment firm based in Toronto. ''Global commodities ranging from oil to base metals to grains are moving higher as billions of people in China and around the world get wealthier and are consuming more as they produce products for us, and increasingly for themselves.'' ''The world is coming alive and the lights are coming on across Asia,'' said James Glassman, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''What we are dealing with is a tremendous demand for resources.'' ''I would temper wild-eyed bulls who think China can grow at 10 percent plus without a strong United States,'' said Adam Robinson, an energy analyst at Lehman Brothers. He said that China, which was an importer of steel and aluminum as recently as 2002, is now an important exporter of both to the United States and Europe and that some of the new steel factories could fail if there was a global recession.",433765302,Newspapers,"Krauss, Clifford", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 15, 2008", News," Jan 15, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, C.1," New York, N.Y.","Jan 15, 2008",New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433765302?accountid=14902, C.1," Commodity prices , Futures trading , Global economy",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Commodities%27+Relentless+Surge&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-01-15&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=C.1&amp;au=Krauss%2C+Clifford&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream
McCain And Bush's Heirs,"As his party moved to the right in the 1990s, he started drifting to the left. By 2001, he was criticizing the Bush administration's tax cut as a fiscally irresponsible gift to the affluent ''at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief.'' As the conservatives at the Club for Growth have gleefully pointed out, he started sounding a lot like Ted Kennedy. ''We have to have outcome-based results for health care,'' he said during a debate on Sunday night. ''And that way, we'll have a healthier nation, and we will have less health care costs.'' I asked Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is Mr. [John McCain]'s top economic adviser, about these comments, and he said that Mr. McCain had misspoken. Mr. Holtz-Eakin then called Mr. McCain on the campaign trail and later gave me this statement from him: ''Tax cuts don't pay for themselves, but pro-growth tax cuts -- especially along with spending restraint -- spur the economy, which raises incomes, and offsets the revenue loss.''",433769194,Newspapers,"Leonhardt, David", NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 9, 2008", Commentary," Jan 9, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, C.1," New York, N.Y.","Jan 9, 2008",New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433769194?accountid=14902, C.1," Presidential elections , Tax cuts , Fiscal policy , Candidates , McCain, John , Huckabee, Mike , Giuliani, Rudolph W , Romney, W Mitt",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=McCain+And+Bush%27s+Heirs&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-01-09&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=C.1&amp;au=Leonhardt%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream
The One Environmental Issue: [Editorial],"Polls suggest, however, that voters are increasingly alarmed, and for that Mr. [Al Gore] is partly responsible. His film, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' raised the issue's profile. Then came four reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Gore, predicting catastrophic changes in weather patterns, sea levels and food production unless greenhouses gases can be quickly stabilized and then reduced by as much as 80 percent by midcentury. Still, the country is a long way from a comprehensive response equal to the challenge. That is what the Democratic candidates are proposing. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, former Senator John Edwards, Gov. Bill Richardson and Representative Dennis Kucinich have all offered aggressive plans that would go beyond the Senate bill and reduce emissions by 80 percent by midcentury (90 percent in Mr. Richardson's case), much as called for in the United Nations reports. The other leading Republican candidates -- Mitt Romney, Rudolph Giuliani, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee -- talk about energy issues almost exclusively in the context of freeing America from its dependence on foreign oil. All promote nuclear power, embrace energy efficiency and promise greener technologies. Only Mr. Huckabee has dared raise the idea of government regulation, embracing, at least theoretically, the idea of a mandatory cap on emissions. The rest prefer President Bush's cost-free and demonstrably inadequate voluntary approach, which essentially asks industry to do what it can to reduce emissions.",433771453,Newspapers,, NYTIAO,," Copyright New York Times Company Jan 1, 2008", Editorial," Jan 1, 2008",0362-4331, English, English, A.16," New York, N.Y.","Jan 1, 2008",New York Times,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/433771453?accountid=14902, A.16," Editorials , Presidential elections , Global warming , Environmental policy , Climate change , United States , US",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=The+One+Environmental+Issue%3A+%5BEditorial%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.16&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream

Coming Vote in Europe Is a Big Test for Efforts to Curb Carbon Emissions: [Business/Financial Desk],"  Carbon emission permits are essentially licenses to release greenhouse gases -- the emissions that scientists have linked to global warming. Permits are priced in units that allow the holders to emit a ton of greenhouse gases. Because a big user of coal-burning power plants might release millions of tons of greenhouse gases a year, the higher the prices for the permits, the higher the cost for polluting.",1327062724,Newspapers,"Reed, Stanley", NYTIAO," European Commission

""The real question in this country,"" said Mr. Steer, a British citizen, ""is why politicians don't see it as in their interest to discuss it."" The list of reasons is long.

"Great Barrier Reef Is Imperiled, Much of It Dying or Dead: [Foreign Desk]","Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish, and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs. [...]an Australian government study released last week found that over all, last year brought ""the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record."" The Australian government has tried to combat these local threats with its Reef 2050 plan, restricting port development, dredging and agricultural runoff, among other risks. If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years. Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators. Kim M.

Trump Budget Seeks Big Tilt to the Military: [National Desk],"President Trump will send a budget to Congress on Thursday that sharply reorders the nation's priorities by spending billions of dollars on defending the southern border and bolstering the Pentagon while severely cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment. Funding to several smaller government agencies that have long been targets of conservatives -- like the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts -- would be axed entirely. The proposed $54 billion increase in military spending -- a 10 percent increase -- would also require a repeal of spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act; Democrats oppose such a move without equal spending increases for domestic programs. The brunt of the cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services would be at the National Institutes of Health, the country's medical research hub.

"Combative, Conflicting and Confusing: [National Desk]","Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, drew criticism on Thursday for saying that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, contradicting years of established science. The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 Here (and many other times) Mr. Trump sounds a popular conservative theme: Both terms are still in use, but as NASA stated in 2008, ""climate change"" has become the preferred term on its website because ""temperature change itself isn't the most severe effect of changing climate,"" and cited shifting weather patterns and rising sea levels. Mr. Trump's organization, by the way, used the term ""global warming and its effects"" when applying for a permit to build protection against coastal erosion for his golf course in Ireland. [...]the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation, the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency says that renewable sources have surpassed coal as the largest provider of global energy capacity. Mr. Trump's arguments about subsidies, often used by opponents of renewable energy, also tend to ignore subsidies received by fossil fuel industries.

New Administrator Stacks E.P.A. With Climate Change Skeptics: [National Desk],"A pair of Trump campaigners from Washington State are also heading into senior positions at the E.P.A. Don Benton, a former Washington state senator who headed President Trump's state campaign, will be the agency's senior liaison with the White House. Last month, he invited Tony Heller, a climate denialist who blogs under the pseudonym Steven Goddard, to address a Washington State Senate committee on the costs of climate change policy. Another transition official under consideration by Mr. Pruitt for a permanent position is David Kreutzer, a senior research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has publicly praised the benefits of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of dismantling a major Obama-era regulation aimed at increasing the federal government's authority over rivers, streams and wetlands in order to prevent water pollution.

"The Rush to Uncover, and Save, 'Dark Data': [Science Desk]","Reports last week that the administration is proposing deep budget cuts for government agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have fueled new fears of databases being axed, if only as a cost-saving measure. Pie charts on a Department of Energy website illustrating the link between coal and greenhouse gas emissions also have disappeared. Some open-data activists refer to it as ""dark data"" -- and they are not talking about classified information or data the government might release only if compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request. The need to write custom code to extract data from, say, the E.P.A.'s discharge monitoring reports is one reason that, despite having hosted more than two dozen ""data rescue"" events since January, the activist group Data Refuge lists only 158 data sets in its public directory. In a recent letter to the federal Office of Management and Budget, Ms. McDermott's group cited a clause in the 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act that requires agencies to ""provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination products.""",1874617203,Newspapers,"Harmon, Amy",," Environmental Protection Agency--EPA

My Appalachia Wasn't Trump's: [Op-Ed],"In the late 1960s, the civil rights movement turned in part from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s appeal to the golden rule to a more aggressive, fist-shaking assertion of black power -- ""If America don't come around,"" the activist H. Rap Brown declared, ""we're going to burn it down"" -- that scared the average white American. [...]when those same whites saw the education of their children affected by what they regarded as the social experiment of busing, inflicted on them by the liberal elite, you could see them beginning to move toward conservatism and a reawakening of the prejudice that Dr. King's nonviolence had made so much progress toward overcoming. [...]when the anti-abortion movement arose in response to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, liberals were reluctant to acknowledge the moral choice involved in abortion.

Divide at the White House Over the Paris Climate Agreement: [National Desk],"The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump's campaign promise to ""cancel"" the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Mr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama's global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science. Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama's E.P.A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from coal-fired power plants. According to leaked budget documents, the president will also propose killing off nearly two dozen E.P.A. programs, including the Obama-era Clean Power Program, climate partnership programs with local governments, Energy Star grants to encourage efficiency research in consumer products and climate-change research.

He Controls a Fifth of the Nation. Meet Ryan Zinke.: [National Desk],"The position puts Mr. Zinke in control of 500 million acres of United States land -- roughly a fifth of the nation -- and charged with balancing the department's contradictory duties of conserving land and mining it for resources at a time of intense pressure from energy producers, environmental activists, state lawmakers and his own boss, who made fossil fuel jobs a crucial part of his campaign platform. Mr. Zinke's portfolio includes not only the country's 59 national parks but also millions of acres rich in coal, oil, timber and natural gas, as well as the management of land and services for 567 native tribes. President Barack Obama blocked new coal leases, imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the Grand Canyon and set aside 553 million acres for national monuments, more than any other president. Mr. Zinke entered politics in 2009, serving two terms in the Montana Legislature, and became the state's at-large representative in the United States House of Representatives in 2015. The White House is expected to push for most cuts to come from the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service, which designates endangered species. Yet the office has a backlog of more than 500 species of plants and animals that are awaiting a legal determination of protection under the Endangered Species Act.

Tony Blair's Lesson for Trump: Commentary,"At their core, both seek to undermine the big systems that have stabilized the globe and spread prosperity, security, rule of law, democracy and openness after two world wars: the European Union, the global trading system, Nafta, NATO, the United Nations and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. The critics are great at pointing out the flaws of these systems, but they always forget to mention the hundreds of millions of people they lifted from poverty to prosperity and the extraordinary 70 years of peace they maintained since the end of World War II. In the Cold War era the world was glued together by these global institutions and by the fear and the discipline of two superpowers. The way Blair described Prime Minister Theresa May's commitment to executing Brexit -- no matter what -- sounded just like G.O.P. leaders' support for Trump's ideas after they had denounced them as utterly crackpot during the presidential campaign. Blair recalled other bogus arguments that were used by Brexit advocates and that have already evaporated -- like the notions that leaving the E.U. would save Britain some $440 million a week for its national health care service and that there was a danger -- most effectively exploited in a fear-inducing poster -- that Syrian refugees would overwhelm the U.K., but there was no Syrian refugee flood.

Industry Tries to Reframe Coal's Image: [Business/Financial Desk],"Cloud Peak Energy, Peabody Energy and Arch Coal -- are going so far as to make common cause with some of their harshest critics, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Clean Air Task Force. The technology they are promoting is carbon capture and sequestration -- an expensive and, up to now, unwieldy method of trapping carbon dioxide emitted from coal-fired power plants before the gas can blanket the atmosphere and warm the planet. [...]they say that any rollback of Obama regulatory policies by the new administration may not be enough to keep utilities from switching from coal to low-cost natural gas and renewables, and that only assurances of government support for carbon capture and sequestration can give utilities certainty that coal has a long-term future and encourage them to retrofit old power plants to be cleaner burning. Vic Svec, a Peabody senior vice president, said that his company was looking to make ""a fresh start"" as it comes out of bankruptcy, and that part of that fresh start was recognizing that fossil fuels ""contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and concern regarding these emissions has become part of the global, societal regulatory landscape."" Environmentalists say they believe that the coal industry, having dealt with a sharp downturn in recent years and facing an aggressive investor divestment movement, may be shifting its views on climate change more for its own business interests than any newfound love for the environment.

"E.P.A. Chief Was Cozy With Energy Industry, Trove of Emails Shows: [National Desk]","The companies provided him with draft letters to send to federal regulators in an attempt to block regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas wells, ozone air pollution and chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the technique of injecting chemicals underground to extract oil and gas, the emails show. From that perch, Mr. Pruitt took part in 14 lawsuits against major E.P.A. environmental rules, at times in coordination with energy companies such as Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric, whose executives held a fund-raising event for Mr. Pruitt, while he joined with the company to challenge a rule that would require it to upgrade or replace certain coal-burning power plants. The emails show that his office corresponded with those companies -- including Devon Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas producer, and American Electric Power, an Ohio-based utility -- in efforts to weaken federal environmental regulations, the same rules he will now oversee. ""Please find attached a short white paper with some talking points that you might find useful to cut and paste when encouraging states to file comments on the S.S.M. rule,"" wrote Roderick Hastie, a lobbyist at Hunton &amp; Williams, a law firm that represents major utilities, including Southern Company, urging Mr. Pruitt's office to file comments on a proposed E.P.A. rule related to so-called start-up, shutdown and malfunction emissions.

Interoffice Spat Erupts Into Climate-Change Furor: [Business/Financial Desk],"A few weeks ago, on an obscure climate-change blog, a retired government scientist named John Bates blasted his former boss on an esoteric point having to do with archiving temperature data. ""How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data,"" the article's headline said. Interviews with six of his former colleagues at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, including two former bosses, painted a picture of a room filled with brilliant scientists, and -- like many workplaces -- its fair share of mundane professional spats and jealousies. Dr. Bates was demoted from a managerial role in 2012 under Thomas Karl -- the lead author of the study Dr. Bates has questioned -- after complaints over Dr. Bates's professional conduct, according to the former colleagues and supervisors. According to the article in The Mail, Dr. Bates claimed that the study relied on problematic data. The outcry over Dr. Bates's claims points to a push by some in the right-wing media to cast doubt on established climate science, and to dispel public support for emissions regulations.",1870178103,Newspapers,"Tabuchi, Hiroko",," National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration--NOAA

Mr. Gifford supervised the repair of the old boiler, working under bare light bulbs and temporary electrical power lines strung along the basement ceiling. After two years, it received $1.2 million for repair and resilient design work at No. 334 through the city's Build It Back program, financed by a federal disaster recovery block grant. The rooftop was scarcely designed to accommodate a 50,000-pound boiler penthouse, so two steel I-beams were laid down, resting on the existing brick exterior walls.

How New York Keeps the Lights On: [Metropolitan Desk],"[...]the kilowatt-hour produced down the block probably costs more than the one produced at the Canadian border. [...]a surprising portion of the system is idle except for the hottest days of the year, when already bottlenecked transmission lines into the New York City area reach their physical limit. According to the latest figures, less than a quarter of the electric energy produced in New York came from renewables. The cost of building wind and solar plants has fallen, but these power sources are intermittent. [...]more storage is plugged into the grid, like batteries or pumped hydro plants, which pump water into reservoirs to store power for later use, other generators must be available to supplement solar and wind power. [...]customers pay for plants and wires that ""a lot of the time are hardly used,"" said Mr. Kauffman, the energy czar.

Coal Plants Threaten China's Climate Efforts: [Foreign Desk],"[...]in those towers, a rare and contentious process is underway, spewing an alarming amount of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas accelerating climate change.[...]worst of all, critics say, it emits more carbon dioxide than traditional methods of energy production, even other coal-based ways.Two Duke University researchers published an essay in 2013 recommending that Chinese officials cancel the coal-to-gas programs.The National Development and Reform Commission, the government's economic planning agency, held a forum in January 2014 for experts to discuss the effects of coal-to-gas on climate change.State-owned energy companies label coal-to-gas plants as ""clean energy"" or ""new energy,"" despite their high levels of carbon dioxide emissions.In his 2015 article, Mr. Li said that carbon dioxide emissions from coal-to-gas were 270 percent greater than natural gas from traditional sources.[...]they increase emissions.""Another climate researcher, Jiang Kejun, said that if China adopted coal-to-gas on a larger scale in five to 10 years, then officials would have to find a way to get companies to use carbon capture technology to limit the effect of the emissions.Since coal-to-gas plants are expensive to operate, market forces may end up dampening their popularity, he said.In early 2015, China Business Journal published a report that said a coal-to-gas plant run by a Huineng Group subsidiary in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, was operating at a daily loss of 1.12 million renminbi, about $160,000.",1865712552,Newspapers,"Wong, Edward",,," Copyright New York Times Company Feb 8, 2017", News," Feb 8, 2017",0362-4331, English, English, A.8," New York, N.Y.","Feb 8, 2017",New York Times,2017,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865712552?accountid=14902, A.8," Environmental protection , Paris Agreement , Pilot projects , Emissions , Energy industry , Climate change , Public officials , Coal , Economic summit conferences , Carbon dioxide , Energy economics , Natural gas , Beijing China",,https://searchit.libraries.wsu.edu/openurl/WSU/WSU?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=Coal+Plants+Threaten+China%27s+Climate+Efforts%3A+%5BForeign+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2017-02-08&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.8&amp;au=Wong%2C+Edward&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,Global Newsstream
"Nominee Appears Poised to Cut E.P.A. With a Scalpel, Not a Cleaver: [National Desk]","[...]the president has promised to ""eliminate"" former President Barack Obama's major environmental regulations, including a global warming rule that was one of Mr. Obama's proudest achievements and another major regulation to curb pollution in lakes, streams and rivers. ""The point here will be, more than in any prior administration, to reduce the agency's effectiveness so much that it can't recover even when the political winds change,"" said David Doniger, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Clinton administration who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. Even if he could kill the Obama-era Clean Power Plan outright, he would not eliminate a legal requirement for the E.P.A. to continue regulating greenhouse gas emissions. ""If confirmed, I will implement the laws that E.P.A. is charged to administer,"" he wrote to Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Among those laws, Mr. Pruitt said in his answers, is the Clean Air Act provision requiring that the E.P.A. regulate the carbon dioxide pollution that warms the planet. The Obama climate plan is aimed at transforming the nation's electric power system, driving it away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.

The Rural Minority: [Education Life Supplement],"Given election results that turned up the volume on the concerns of rural Americans, who voted their discontent over lost jobs and economic disparities, higher education leaders are now talking about how to reach the hard-to-get-to. In their aim to shape leaders and provide access to the disadvantaged, higher education experts have been recognizing that these students bring valuable experiences and viewpoints to campuses that don't typically attract agriculture majors. While students in rural high schools graduate at rates second only to suburban students (80 percent, compared with 81 percent), and perform at or above other students on the National Assessment for Educational Progress, they enroll in four-year degree programs and pursue advanced degrees at lower rates. ""People who have grown up in our state, if they have grown up on a farm or a family connected to the coal mining industry, many of them believe erroneously that college may not be all that important,"" said Robert L. King, president of the state's Council on Postsecondary Education. With oil and gas prices down and energy companies shuttered -- hurting manufacturing, steel and other industries -- a two-year degree, he said, can help land or keep a job. A team is also in place exploring more tailored help, including virtual college advisers with local knowledge, a rural-specific college application guide, outreach to counselors in rural districts and more online help (100,000 rural students have signed up for personalized SAT practice on the Khan Academy site through the College Board).

At a private meeting on Thursday hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, a senior White House adviser provided a plan on how the administration would handle efforts to curtail environmental regulations beyond the initial rush now underway to nullify recently adopted rules, said an energy industry executive who participated in the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because details were confidential.

G.O.P. Reverses Obama-Era Rule to Protect Streams From Coal Mining: [National Desk],"Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America's neglected heartland. The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said -- especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia.

How the Next Nominee for the Supreme Court Could Influence Cases: [National Desk],"Since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February, the Supreme Court has been evenly divided between Democratic appointees and Republican ones. Justice Kennedy had once before voted to find an abortion restriction unconstitutional, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, when he joined Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter to save the core of Roe v. Wade. [...]Justice Kennedy is unlikely to retreat from his position in the Texas case, and a new four-member conservative bloc would probably not vote to add an affirmative action case to the court's docket unless its members thought they could attract Justice Kennedy's vote. Environmental Regulations May Be in Peril A few days before Justice Scalia died, the Supreme Court's five-member conservative majority blocked President Barack Obama's ambitious effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants.

Gauging How Fast Trump Can Undo Obama's Climate Legacy: [National Desk],"Coal mining on federal lands A year ago, Mr. Obama incited the coal industry's rage with a stroke-of-the-pen executive action banning new leasing of coal mines on public lands.On Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Trump took office, the Obama administration completed a rule to reduce mountaintop-removal coal mining, which uses explosives to blast off the tops of coal-seamed mountains.Regulation on methane emissions In November, the Interior Department completed a rule reining in the venting of methane, a potent planet-warming greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling facilities.Like the mountaintop-mining rule, this one falls into the 60-day window allowing Congress to quickly overturn it with a 51-vote majority It is expected that the fossil fuel industry's allies in the Senate will quickly push to do so.Rolling back vehicle fuel economy standards While it can't be done quickly, there is a clear legal path for the Trump administration to undo one of the hallmarks of Mr. Obama's climate change policies: a 2011 regulation requiring automakers to build fleets of cars by 2025 that achieve an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon.Rewriting regulations on climate change The centerpiece of Mr. Obama's climate change policy is a 2015 E.P.A. rule curbing greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities.President Trump Hopes to End Environmental Regulations Involving Water Pollution, Fuel Efficiency Standards, Coal Mining and More.",1862995763,Newspapers,"Davenport, Coral",," Harvard University

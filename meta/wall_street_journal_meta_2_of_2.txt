Volvo Discovers Electric-Vehicle Hype,"Volvo, unlike just about every major car maker, doesn't even have an electric car in the market today. The hybrid version of the XC90 comes with a $75,000 price tag: A customer who wants a hybrid is also presumed to want the 19-speaker, 1,400-watt sound system, the self-parking package and every other option Volvo can stuff into a $75,000 SUV. Volvo's announcement signals nothing about the electric-car future and everything about Volvo's niche marketing. [...]Volvo-like safety has long since become the price of admission in the car business, so Volvo has been deliberately rebranding its niche -- and its ambitions are entirely wrapped up in being a niche player -- as a technology icon. [...]only through the intervention of Angela Merkel, the German leader who knows a thing or two about green excess, was the timeline delayed from 2018.",1916942608,Newspapers,"Jenkins, Holman W, Jr",," Volvo AB

Studies by the Environmental Protection Agency and academia have shown that diverting one ton of municipal solid waste from sanitary landfills to waste-burning plants reduces greenhouse-gas emissions by at least half a ton of carbon dioxide per ton of waste.",1733093458,Newspapers,Anonymous,,," (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"REVIEW --- The Smart Way to Do Fracking --- Plug leaks, run more tests and build better wells","  [...]fracking is an industrial process, and its many critics have some real and legitimate concerns about its impact on the environment and the communities near the wells.

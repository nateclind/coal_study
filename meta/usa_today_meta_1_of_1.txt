Musk's dance with Trump: Many wonder what he stands to gain from 'weird' bromance,"In attending President Trump's first business advisory council meeting, the South African-born, self-made billionaire who is bent on saving the world from global warming will have become a counselor to a New York real estate mogul-turned-president who is eager to bring back the age of coal. In particular, Musk would appear to be on the brink of bringing sleek electric cars to the masses with his entry-level Model 3 sedan, whose success is key to Tesla becoming profitable and justifying the steep run in its shares. What's more, if anything happened to today's federal tax incentives on electric cars, Musk could find that his wares cost $7,500 more overnight, no small matter on the $35,000 Model 3. [...]another potential pothole looms for Musk, one that's already dinged another tech company in talks with the White House. Musk is on Friday's Strategy and Policy Forum council along with CEOs from Pepsi, General Motors and JP MorganChase, and he's part of a group focused on manufacturing -- there exists the potential brand blowback that Uber experienced this week. Musk biographer Vance says that despite the liberal nature of Tesla's green energy agenda, the boss ultimately knows that reaching his business goals --...",1871521851,Newspapers,Marco della Cava,," Space Exploration Technologies Corp

Of fish and forests,"  President Bush certainly has a penchant for protecting remote ocean ecosystems. His announcement Monday that he would set aside 195,280 square miles of Pacific Ocean in the Mariana Islands and elsewhere, combined with an ocean preserve he created near Hawaii in 2006, brings his total of protected waters above 300,000 square miles. That's an area bigger than Bush's home state of Texas. It's more than any person has set aside before and likely will for the foreseeable future. And it is, without doubt, a commendable effort to protect wide swaths of richly diverse aquatic life from commercial exploitation and waste dumping. The action two weeks before he leaves office does, however, underscore one of the unfortunate aspects of Bush's environmental policy.
